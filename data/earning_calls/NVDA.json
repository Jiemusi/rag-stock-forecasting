          "content": "Thanks, Simona. Q1 was exceptionally strong with revenue of $5.66 billion and year-on-year growth accelerating to 84%. We set a record in total revenue in gaming, data center and professional visualization driven by our best ever product lineups and structural tailwinds across our businesses. Starting with gaming, revenue of $2.8 billion was up 11% sequentially and up 106% from a year earlier. This is the third consecutive quarter of accelerating year-on-year growth, beginning with the fall launch of our GeForce RTX 30 Series GPUs. Based on the Ampere GPU architecture, the 30 Series has been our most successful launch ever, driving incredible demand and setting records for both desktop and laptop GPU sales. Channel inventories are still leading, and we expect to remain supply constrained into the second half of the year. With our Ampere GPU architecture now ramping across the stack in both desktop and laptops, we expect the RTX upgrade cycle to kick into high gear as the vast majority of our GPU installed base needs to upgrade. Laptops continue to drive strong growth this quarter as we started ramping the Ampere GPU architecture across our lineup. Earlier this month, all major PC OEMs launched GeForce RTX 30 Series laptops based on the 3080, 3070 and 3060 as part of their spring refresh. In addition, mainstream versions based on the 3050 and 3050 Ti will be available this summer, just in time for back-to-school starting at price points as low as 799. This is the largest ever wave of GeForce gaming laptops, over 140 in total, as OEMs address the rising demand from gamers, creators and students for NVIDIA's powered laptops. The RTX 30 Series delivers our biggest generational leap in performance ever. It also features our second-generation ray tracing technology and frame rate boosting, AI-powered DLSS. The RTX is a reset for graphics with over 60 accelerated games. This quarter, we added many more, including Call of Duty, Modern Warfare, Crysis Remastered and Outriders. We also announced that DLSS is now available in Unreal Engine 4 and soon in the Unity game engine, enabling game developers to accelerate frame rates with minimal effort. The RTX 30 Series also offers NVIDIA Reflex, a new technology that reduces system latency. Reflex is emerging as a must-have feature for e-sports gamers who play competitive titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, Fortnite, Valorant and Apex Legends. We estimate that about 75% of GeForce gamers play e-sports games and 99% of e-sports pros compete on GeForce. We believe gaming also benefited from crypto mining demand, although it's hard to determine to what extent. We've taken actions to optimize GeForce GPUs for gamers while separately addressing mining demand with Cryptocurrency Mining Processors, or CMPs. Last week, we announced that newly manufactured GeForce RTX 3080, RTX 3070 and RTX 3060 Ti graphic cards will have their Ethereum mining capabilities reduced by half and carry a low hash rate or LHR identifier. Along with the updated RTX 3060, this should allow our partners to get more GeForce cards into the hands of gamers at better prices. To help address mining demand, CMP products launched this quarter, optimized for mining performance and efficiency because they don't meet the specifications required of a GeForce GPU; they don't impact the supply of GeForce GPUs to gamers. CMP revenue was $155 million in Q1 reported as part of the OEM and other category. And our Q2 outlook assumes CMP sales of $400 million. Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming platform passed 10 million registered users this quarter. GFN offers nearly 1,000 PC games from over 300 publishers, more than any other cloud gaming service, including 80 of the most popular free-to-play games. GFN expands the reach of GeForce to billions of underpowered Windows PCs, Macs, Chromebooks, Android devices, iPhones and iPads. GFN is offered in over 70 countries with our latest expansions, including Australia, Singapore and South America. Moving to Professional Visualization, Q1 revenue was $372 million, up 21% both sequentially and year-on-year. Strong notebook growth was driven by new sleek and powerful RTX-powered mobile workstations with Max-Q technology, and enterprises continue to support remote workforce initiatives. Desktop workstations rebounded as enterprise resumed the spending that has been deferred during the lockdown, with continued growth likely as offices open. Key verticals driving Q1 demand include manufacturing, healthcare, automotive and media and entertainment. At GTC, we announced the coming general availability of NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise, the world's first technology platform that enables global 3D design teams to collaborate in real-time in a shared space working across multiple software platforms. This incredible technology builds on NVIDIA's entire body of work and is supported by a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Early adopters include sophisticated design teams and some of the world's leading companies such as BMW Group, Foster + Partners and WPP. Over 400 companies have been evaluating Omniverse and nearly 17,000 users have downloaded the open beta. Omniverse is offered as a software subscription on a per-user and a per-server basis. As the world becomes more digital, virtual and collaborative, we see a significant revenue opportunity for Omniverse. We also announced powerful new Ampere architecture GPUs for next-generation desktop and laptop workstations. Moving to Automotive, Q1 revenue was $154 million, up 6% sequentially and down 1% year-on-year. Growth in AI cockpit revenue was partially offset by the expected decline in legacy infotainment revenue. We extended our technology leadership with the announcement of the next-generation NVIDIA DRIVE Atlan SoC. Atlan will deliver an unrivaled 1,000 trillion operations per second of performance and integrate data center class NVIDIA BlueField networking and security technologies to enhance vehicle performance and safety, making it a true data center on wheels. Atlan, which targets automakers' 2025 models, will follow the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SoC, which delivers 254 TOPS that has been selected by leading vehicle makers for production timelines starting next year. The NVIDIA DRIVE platform has achieved global adoption across the transportation industry. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds 8 billion through fiscal 2027. Most recently, Volvo Cars announced that it will use NVIDIA DRIVE Orin, building on our next great momentum with some of the largest automakers including Mercedes Benz, SAIC and Hyundai Motor Group. In robotaxis, we added GM Cruise to the growing number of companies adopting the NVIDIA DRIVE platform, which includes Amazon Zoox and DiDi. We\u2019ve also had great traction with new energy vehicle makers. Our latest wins include Faraday Future, R Auto, IM Motors and VinFast, which join previously announced wins with SAIC, NIO, XPeng and Li Auto. In trucking, Navistar has partnered with TuSimple in selecting NVIDIA DRIVE for autonomous driving, joining previously announced robo-autonomous solutions. NVIDIA is helping to revolutionize the transportation industry. Our full stack software-defined AV and AI cockpit platform spans silicon, systems, software and AI data center infrastructure, enabling over-the-air upgrades to enhance safety and the joy of driving throughout the vehicle's lifetime. Starting with our lead partner, Mercedes Benz, NVIDIA DRIVE can transform the automotive industry with amazing technologies delivered through new software and services business models. Moving to the data center, revenue topped $2 billion for the first time, growing 8% sequentially and up 79% from the year-ago quarter, which did not include Mellanox. Hyperscale customers led our growth this quarter, as they built infrastructure to commercialize AI in their services. In addition, cloud providers have adopted the A100 to support growing demand for AI for enterprises, startups and research organizations. Customers have deployed NVIDIA's A100 and DGX platforms to train deep neural networks with rising computational intensity, led by two of the fastest growing areas of AI: natural language understanding and deep recommendation systems. In March, Google Cloud Platform announced general availability of the A100 with early customers including Square for its cash application and Alphabet\u2019s DeepMind. The A100 is deployed across all major hyperscale and cloud service providers globally. And we see strengthening demand in the coming quarters. Every industry is becoming a technology industry and accelerating investments in AI infrastructure, both through the cloud and on-premises. Our vertical industries grew both sequentially and year-on-year, led by consumer internet companies. For example, NAVER, a leading internet technology company in Korea and Japan, is training giant AI language models at scale on DGX SuperPOD to pioneer new services across e-commerce, search, entertainment and payment applications. We continue to gain traction in France with hyperscale and vertical industry customers across a broadening portfolio of GPOs. We had record shipments of GPUs used for inference. Inference growth is driving not just the T4, which was up strongly in the quarter, but also the universal A100 Tensor Core GPU as well as the new Ampere architecture-based A10 and A30 GPUs, all excellent at training as well as inferencing. Customers are increasingly migrating from CPUs to GPUs for AI inference for two chief reasons. First, GPUs can better keep up with the exponential growth in the size and complexity of deep neural networks and respond with the required low latency. In April's MLPerf AI inference benchmark, NVIDIA achieved the top results across every category that includes computer vision, medical imaging, recommender systems, speech recognition and natural language processing. And second, NVIDIA's full stack inference platform, including Triton and inference server software, simplifies the complexity of deploying AI applications by supporting models from all major frameworks, and optimizing for different query types including batch, real-time and streaming. Triton is supported by several partners in the cloud services, including Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Tencent. Examples of how customers use NVIDIA's inference platform include Microsoft for grammar checking in Office, the United States Postal Service for real-time package analytics, T-Mobile for customer service, Pinterest for image search, and GE Healthcare for heart disease detection. We also have strong results with Mellanox networking products. Like our compute business, strong growth was driven by hyperscale customers across both Ethernet and InfiniBand. We achieved key design wins and proof-of-concept trials for the NVIDIA BlueField-2 DPU, the cloud service providers and consumer internet companies. We also unveiled BlueField-3, the first DPU built for AI and accelerated computing, with support from VMware, Splunk, NetApp, Cloudflare and others. BlueField-3 is the industry's first 400 gig DPU and delivers the equivalent data center services of up to 300 CPU cores. It transforms traditional server infrastructure into zero trust environments in which every user is authenticated by offloading and isolating data center services for business applications. With BlueField-3, our DPU roadmap will deliver an unrivaled 100x performance increase over a 3-year period. As we look back at the first full year since closing the Mellanox acquisition, we are extremely pleased with how the business has performed. It has not only exceeded our financial projections but it has been instrumental in key new platforms like the DGX SuperPOD and the BlueField DPU, enabling our data center scale computing strategy. In April, we held our largest ever GPU Technology Conference with more than 200,000 registrants from 195 countries. Jensen's keynote has over 14 million views. At GTC, we announced our first data center CPU, NVIDIA Grace, targeted at processing massive next generation AI models with trillions of parameters. The arm-based processor will enable 10x the performance and energy efficiency of today's fastest servers. With Grace, NVIDIA has a three-chip strategy with GPU, DPU and now CPU. The Swiss National Supercomputing Center and the US Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory are the first to announce plans to build Grace-powered supercomputers. Grace will be available in early 2023. GTC is first and foremost for developers. We announced NVIDIA-developed and optimized pre-trained model availability on the NVIDIA GPU cloud registry. Developers can choose a pre-trained model and adapt it to fit their specific needs using NVIDIA TAO, our transfer learning software. TAO fine-tunes the model with the customer's own small dataset to get models accustomed without the cost of finding massive datasets required to train a neural network from scratch. Once a model is optimized and ready for deployment, users can integrate it with an NVIDIA application framework that fits their use. For example, the NVIDIA Jarvis framework for interactive conversational AI is now generally available and used by customers such as T-Mobile and Snap, and the NVIDIA Merlin framework for deep recommendation systems is in open beta with customers such as Snap and Tencent. With the chosen application framework, users can launch NVIDIA Fleet Command software to deploy and manage the AI application across a variety of NVIDIA GPU-powered devices. For enterprise customers, we unveiled a new enterprise-grade software offering available as a perpetual license or subscription. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is a comprehensive suite of AI software that speeds development and deployment of AI workloads and simplifies management of enterprise AI infrastructure. Through our partnership with VMware, hundreds of thousands of vSphere customers will be able to purchase NVIDIA AI Enterprise with the same familiar pricing model that IT managers use to procure VMware infrastructure software. We also made several announcements at GTC about accelerating the delivery of both NVIDIA AI and accelerated computing to enterprises and edge users among the world's largest industries. Leading server OEMs launched NVIDIA certified systems, which are industry-standard servers based on the NVIDIA EGX platform. They run NVIDIA AI enterprise software and are supported by the NVIDIA A30 and A10 GPUs. Initial customers include Lockheed Martin and Mass General Brigham. In addition, we announced the NVIDIA AI on 5G platform supported on NVIDIA EGX servers to enable high-performance 5G RAM and AI applications. The AI on 5G platform leverages the NVIDIA Aerial software and the NVIDIA BlueField-2 A100 converged card which combines our GPUs and DPUs. We are teaming with Fujitsu, Google Cloud, Mavenir, Radisys and Wind River in developing solutions based on our AI on 5G platform to speed the creation of smart cities and factories, advanced hospitals and intelligent stores. Another highlight at GTC was the announcement of a broad range of initiatives to strengthen the Arm ecosystem across cloud data centers, HPC, enterprise and edge and PCs. In the cloud, we are bringing together AWS Graviton2 processors and NVIDIA DPUs to provide a range of benefits including lower costs, support for virtual game streaming experiences and greater performance for Arm-based workloads. In HPC, we are bringing together an Ampere Altra CPU with NVIDIA GPUs, DPUs and NVIDIA HPC software development kit. Initial supercomputing centers deployed include Oak Ridge and Los Alamos National Labs. In the Enterprise and Edge, we're bringing together Marvell Arm-based OCTEON processors and NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate video analytics and cybersecurity solutions. And in PCs, we are bringing together MediaTek's Arm-based processors with NVIDIA RTX GPUs to enable realistic ray-traced graphics and cutting-edge AI in a new class of Arm-based laptops. On our Arm acquisition, we are making steady progress in working with the regulators across key regions. We remain on track to close the transaction within our original timeframe of early 2022. Arm's IP is widely used, but the company needs a partner that can help it achieve new heights. NVIDIA is uniquely positioned to enhance Arm's capabilities, and we are committed to invest in developing the Arm ecosystem, enhancing R&D, adding IP and turbocharging its development to grow into new markets in the data center, IoT and embedded devices, areas where it only has a light footprint or in some cases, none at all. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was down 100 basis points from a year earlier and up 100 basis points sequentially. Non-GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points from a year earlier and up 70 basis points sequentially. The sequential non-GAAP increase was largely driven by a more favorable mix within data center and the addition of CMP products. Q1 GAAP EPS was $3.03, up 106% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $3.66, up 103% from a year ago. Q1 cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect broad-based sequential year-on-year revenue growth in all of our market platforms. Our outlook includes $400 million in CMP. Aside from CMP, the sequential revenue increase in our Q2 outlook is driven largely by data center and gaming. In data center, we expect sequential growth in both compute and networking. In gaming, with the move to low hash rate GPUs and increasing the amount of CMP products, we are making a significant effort to serve miners with CMPs and provide more GeForce cards to gamers. If there is additional CMP demand, we have supplied flexibility to support it. We believe these actions combined with strong gaming demand will drive an increase in our core gaming business for Q2. Now to look at our outlook for Q2, revenue is expected to be $6.3 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.6% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.76 billion and $1.26 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $50 million. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 10%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $325 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight that Jeff Fisher and Manuvir Das will keynote Computex on the evening of May 31 U.S time, as well as several upcoming events for the financial community. We will be virtually attending the Evercore TMT Conference on June 7, the BofA 2021 Global Technology Conference on June 9, and the NASDAQ Virtual Investor Conference on June 16. Our earnings call to discuss our second-quarter results is scheduled for Wednesday, August 18. With now, we will open the call for questions. Operator, would you please poll for questions.",

I know of the $600 to $650 million in growth, you said $250 million is coming from CMP and both gaming and data center will be up. Can we assume that they're up about equally, so you're getting about $200 million roughly from each of those? And I guess the second part of that is, within data center, I'm wondering can you speak to the networking piece? It sounds like maybe it was up a bit more modestly than it's been up the past few quarters. I'm just wondering what the outlook is there. Thanks.",

All of our different market platforms we do plan to grow sequentially. You are correct, that we are expecting an increase in our CMP. And outside of our CMP growth, we expect the lion's share of our growth to come from our data center and gaming. In our data center business, right now, our product lineup couldn't be better. We have a strong overall portfolio, both for training and for inferencing, and we're seeing strong demand across our hyperscales and vertical industries. We've made a deliberate effort on the gaming perspective to supply to our gamers the cards that they would like, given the strong demand that we see. So that will also support the sequential growth that we are receiving. So you are correct that we do see growth sequentially coming from data center and gaming, both contributing quite well to our growth.",

          "speaker": "Jensen Huang",
          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "Yes. We're seeing strength across the board in data centers, and we're seeing strengthening demand. C.J., our data center, as you know, is accelerated with a range of applications. From scientific computing, both physical and life sciences, data analytics, and classical machine learning, cloud computing, and cloud graphics, which is becoming more important because of remote work. And very importantly, AI both for training as well as inferencing for classical machine learning models, like XGBoost all the way to deep learning-based models, like conversational AI, natural language understanding, recommender systems, and so on. And so we have a large suite of applications and our NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA HPC as the case, accelerate these applications and data centers. They run on systems that range from HGX for the hyperscalers to DGX for on-prem to EGX for Enterprise and Edge, all the way out to AGX autonomous systems. And this quarter, at GTC, we announced one of our largest initiatives, and it's taken us several years. You've seen us working on it in the open over the course of the last several years, and it's called EGX, it's our Enterprise AI platform. We're democratizing AI. We're bringing it out in cloud, we're bringing it to enterprises, and we're bringing it out to the Edge. And the reason for that is because the vast majority of the world at the automation that has to be done has data that has data sovereignty issues or data rate issues that can't move to the cloud easily. And so we have to move the computing to their premises, and oftentimes all the way up to the edge. The platform has to be secure, has to be confidential, it has to be remotely manageable. And of course, it has to be high-performance and it has to be cloud-native. And that's the built - be built like the cloud, the modern way of doing cloud data centers. And so these stacks have to be modern on the one hand, they have to be integrated into classical enterprise systems on the other hand, which is the reason why we\u2019ve worked so closely with VMware and accelerated VMware's operating system, data center operating system, software-defined data center stacks on BlueField. Meanwhile, we ported NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA HPC onto VMware, so that they could run distributed large-scale accelerated computing for the very first time. And that partnership was announced at VMworld. It was announced at GTC, and we're in the process of going to market with all of our enterprise partners, their OEMs, their value-added resellers, their service - their solution integrators all over the world. And so, this is a really large endeavor, and the early indications of it are really exciting. The reason for that is because, as you know, our data center business is more than 50% vertical industry enterprise already. It's more than 50% vertical industry enterprises already and then by creating this easy to adapt and easy to integrate stack, it's going to allow them to move a lot faster. And so this is the next major wave of AI. This is a very exciting part of our initiative. And it's something that I've been working on for - we've been working on for quite a long time. And so I'm delighted with the launch this quarter at GTC. The rest of the data centers do agree to. As Colette mentioned, hyperscale demand is strengthening. We're seeing that for computing and networking. You know that the world's cloud data centers are moving to deep learning because every small percentage that they get out of predictive inference drives billions and billions of dollars of economics for them. And so the movement towards deep learning shifts the data center workload away from CPUs because accelerators are so important. And so hyperscale, we're seeing great traction and great demand. And then lastly, supercomputing. Supercomputer centers all over the world are building out. And we're really in a great position there to fuse for the very first time simulation-based approaches as well as data-driven approaches what is called artificial intelligence. And so across the board, our data center is gaining momentum. And we see - we just see great strength right now and its growing strength. And we're really set up for years of growth in data center. This is the largest segment of computing as you know, and this segment of computing is going to continue to grow for some time to come.",

That's kind of question one. And then, on the heels of the last question, I was just curious things like VMware's project model ray as we think about the BlueField-2 product and BlueField-3, how should we think about those starting to become or when should they become really material incremental revenue growth contributors for the company?

          "content": "Aaron, a good - great question on BlueField. First of all, the modern data center has to be rearchitected for several reasons. There are several fundamental reasons that make it very, very clear that the architecture has to change. The first insight is cloud-native, which means that a data center is shared for everybody. You don't know who's coming and going and it's exposed to everybody on the internet. Number two, you have to assume that it\u2019s a Zero Trust environment because you don't know who's using it. It used to be that we had perimeter security, but those days are gone because it's cloud-native, it's remote access, it's multi-tenant, it's public cloud, the infrastructure is used for internal and external applications. So number two has to be - it has to be zero trust. The third reason is something that started a long time ago, which is software-defined in every way because you want - you don't want a whole bunch of bespoke custom gear inside a data center, you want to avoid the data center with software. You want to be software defined. The software-defined data center movement enabled this one pane of glass, a few IT managers orchestrating millions and millions of nodes of computers at one place. And the software runs what used to be storage, networking, security, virtualization and all of that - all of those things have become a lot larger and a lot more intensive. And it's consuming a lot of the data center. In fact, the estimate, depending on how you want to think about it, how much security you want to put on it, if you assume that it\u2019s a zero trust data center, probably half of the CPU cores inside the data center is running not applications. And that's kind of strange because you created the data center to run services and applications, which is the only thing that makes money. The other half of the computing is completely soaked up running the software-defined data center just to provide for those applications. And that you could imagine even accepting if you like, as the cost of doing business. However, it commingles the infrastructure, the security plane and the application plane and exposes the data center to attackers. And so you fundamentally want to change the architecture as a result of that. To offload that software-defined virtualization and the infrastructure operating system, if you will, and the security services to accelerate it because Moore's law has ended, and moving software that was running on one CPU - one set of CPUs, which is really, really good already to another set of CPUs is not going to make it more effective. So you want to offload that and take the - take that application software and accelerate it using accelerators, a form of accelerated computing. And so these things are fundamentally what BlueField is all about. And we created the processor that allows us to - BlueField-2 replaces approximately 30 CPU cores. BlueField-3 replaces approximately 300 CPU cores, which just puts it gives you a sense of it. And BlueField-4, we're in the process of building already. And so, we've got a really aggressive pipeline to do this. Now, how big is this market? The way to think about that is every single networking chip in the world will be a smart network - it will check. It will be a programmable accelerated infrastructure processor. And I believe every single server node will have it. It will replace today's mix with something like BlueField, and it will offload about half of the software processing that's consuming data centers today. But most importantly, it will enable this future world where every single packet, every single application is being monitored in real-time all the time for intrusion. And so, how big is that application? How big is that market? Just 25 million servers a year. That's the size of the market. And we know that servers are growing, and so those give you a feeling for that. And then in the future, servers are going to move out to the Edge. And all of those Edge devices will have something like BlueField. And then how are we doing? We're doing PLCs now with just about every internet company. We're doing really exciting work there. We've included it in high-performance computing so that it's possible for supercomputers in the future to be cloud-native, to be zero trust, to be secured and still be a supercomputer. And then we expect next year to have meaningful, if not significant revenue contribution from BlueField, and this is going to be a really large growth market for us. You can tell I'm excited about this. And I've put a lot of my energy into it. The company is working really hard on it. This is a form of accelerated computing that's going to really make a difference.",

And then kind of part B of that is, how do you think about your core PC gamer demand? Because when we see these kinds of 106% year-on-year growth rate, it brings questions of sustainability. So give us your perspectives on these two topics, just how does one ring-fence the crypto effect? And what do you think about the sustainability of your core PC gamer demand? Thank you.",

          "content": "Sure. Thanks a lot. First of all, it's hard to estimate exactly how much and where crypto mining is being done. However, we can only assume that the vast majority of it is contributed by professional miners, especially when the amount of mining increases tremendously like in-house. And so we created the CMP. And CMP and GeForce are not fungible. You could use GeForce for mining, but you can't use CMP for gaming. CMP yields better and producing those doesn't take away from the supply of GeForce. And so it protects our GeForce supply for the gamers. And the question that you have is what happens when on the tail end of this? There are several things that we hope. And we learned a lot from the last time, but you never learn enough about this dynamic. What we hope is that the CMPs will satisfy the miners at work will stay in mines, in the professional mines. And we're trying to produce a fair amount of them and we have secured a lot of demand for the CMPs and we will fulfill it. And what makes it different this time is several things. One, we're at the beginning of our RTX cycle, whereas Pascal was the last GTX. And now exactly was at the tail end of the GTX cycle because the last GTX and it was the tail end of GTX cycle. We're at the very beginning of the RTX 30 cycle. And because we reinvented computer graphics, we reset the computer industry. And after three years, the entire graphics industry has followed. Every game developer needs to do ray tracing, and every content developer and every content tool has moved to ray tracing. And so if you lose ray tracing, these applications are so much better. And they simply run too slowly on GTX's, and so we're seeing a reset of the install base, if you will. And at a time when the gaming market is the largest ever, we've got this incredible install base of GeForce users. We've reinvented computer graphics and reset the install base and created an upgrade opportunity that's really exciting at a time when the market is the gaming market, the gaming industry is really large. And what's really exciting on top of that is that gaming is no longer just gaming. And it's infused into sports, e-sports. It's infused into art. It's infused into social. And so gaming is - it has such a large cultural impact now; it's the largest form of entertainment. And I think that the experience we're going through is going to last a while. And so, one I hope that crypto will - the CMP will steer our GeForce supply to gamers. We see strong demand and I expect to see strong demand for quite some time because of the dynamics that I described. And hopefully in the combination of those two, we'll see strong growth and through strong growth in our core gaming business through the year.",

First, I harken back to the monitor you guys put out a couple of analyst days ago, the more you spend, the more you save. And you've always been very successful as you brought down the cost of doing something to really drive penetration growth. And so I'm curious with the NVIDIA Enterprise AI software stack, is there a sense that you can give us is how much that brings down the cost of deployment and AI inside the Enterprise? And do you think whether COVID lockdown-related or cost-related, there's pent-up demand that this unlocks? And then my second question is just around government subsidies. A lot of talks out of Washington about subsidizing the chip industry, a lot of that goes towards building fabs domestically. But when I look at AI, I can't think of anything more important to maintain sort of leadership in relative to national security. How do we think about NVIDIA and kind of the impact that these government subsidies might have on either you or your customers or your business trends?",

          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "The more you buy, the more you save, there's no question about that. And the reason for that is because we're in the business of accelerated computing; we don't accelerate every application. However, for the applications we do accelerate, the acceleration is so dramatic. And because we sell a component, the entire system, the total cost of ownership, the TCO, of the entire system, and all the services and all the people and the infrastructure and the energy cost has been reduced by factors, sometimes 10x, sometimes 15x, sometimes 5x. And so the - so when we set our mind on accelerating a certain class of applications, and recently we worked on true quantum so that we could help the quantum computing industry it's already there simulators so that they could discover new algorithms and invent future computers, even though it won't happen until 2030. For the next 15 years, we're going to have some really, really great work that we can do using NVIDIA GPUs to do quantum simulations. We recently did a lot of work in natural language understanding in computational biology so that we could decode biology and understand how biology is to infer to understand it and to predictively improve upon it and design new proteins. Those words are so vital. And that's what accelerated computing is all about. Our Enterprise software, and I really appreciate the question. Our Enterprise software used to be just about the BGP, which is virtualizing GPU inside the VMware environment, or inside the Red Hat environment, and makes it possible for multiple users to use one GPU, which is the nature of Enterprise virtualization; but now with NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse, NVIDIA Fleet Command, whether you're doing collaboration or virtual simulations for robotics and digital twins, designing your factory or you're doing data analytics, learning what the predictive features are that could create an AI model, predictive model that you can deploy out at the Edge using Fleet Command. We now have an intense suite of software that is consistent with today's enterprise service agreements. It's consistent with today's enterprise business models and allows us to support customers directly and provide them with the necessary service promises that they expect because they are delivering - they're trying to build a mission-critical application on top. And, more importantly, by creating this - prioritizing our software, we provide the ability for our large network of partners, OEM partners, value-added resellers, solution providers for this large network of hundreds of thousands of IT sales professionals that we are connected to through our network, we give them a product that they can take to market. And so the distribution channel, the sales channel, VMware, the sales channel of Cloudera, the sales channel of all of our partners, and design, Autodesk, so on and so forth, all of these sales channels and all of these partners are now partners and taking our stacks to market. And we have a fully integrated system that are open to the OEM, so that they could create systems to run the stack. And it's all certified, all tested, all benchmarked and, of course, very importantly, all supported. And so this new way of taking our products to market, whereas our cloud business is going to continue to grow, and that part of AI is going to continue to grow that business is direct. We sell components directly to them, we support them directly. But there are 10 of those customers in the world. For Enterprises, there are thousands of industries far and wide. And so I think this - we now have a great stack and a great software stack that allows us to take it to the world's market so that everybody could buy more and save more.",

So Colette, last quarter you had suggested that Q1 would be the trough for, I guess, for gaming as well as the rest of the company beginning in particular, and it would grow sequentially through the year. I guess given the strength we're seeing in the first half, do you still believe that that is the case? And I kind of heard you guys, I think kind of dance around that point a little bit in response to one of the other questions. But could you clarify that? Is that still your belief that that core gaming business can grow sequentially through the rest of the year? And I guess the same question is for data center, especially since it sounds like hyperscale is now coming back, like after a few quarters of digestion and then all of the other tailwinds you've talked about. I mean, is there any reason to think that data center itself shouldn't also grow sequentially, like through the rest of the year?",

And when we're looking at Q1, we were really discussing a lot about what we expected between Q4 and Q1. Given what we knew was still high demand for gaming. We believed we would continue to grow between Q4 and Q1, which often we don't. And we absolutely have the strength and overall demand to grow. What that then lead was, again, continued growth from Q1 to Q2 as we are working hard to provide more supply for the strong demand that we see. We have talked about that we have additional supply coming. We expect to continue to grow as we move into the second half of the year as well for gaming. Now, we only guide one quarter at a time, but our plan is to take the supply, serve the overall gamers, work on building out the channel, as we know the channel is quite lean. And so yes, we do and still expect growth in the second half of the year, particularly when we see the lineup of games, the holiday overall coming, the back-to-school, all very important cycles for us. And there's a great opportunity to upgrade this RTX install base. Now, in terms of data center, we'll work in terms of our guidance here. We have growth from Q1 to Q2 planned in our overall guidance. And we do see as things continue to open up a time to accelerate in the second half of the year for data center. We have, again, a great lineup of products here. It couldn't be a better lineup now that we've also added the inferencing products and the host of overall applications that are using our software that we have. So this could be an opportunity as well to see that continued growth. We will work in terms of serving the supply that we need for both of these markets. But yes, we can see definitely growth in the second half of the year.",

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. Q2 was another strong quarter with revenue of $6.5 billion and year-on-year growth of 68%. We set records for total revenue, as well as for gaming, data center, and professional visualization. Starting with gaming, revenue was $3.1 billion, which was up 11% sequentially, and up 85% from a year earlier. Demand remained exceptionally strong, outpacing supply. We are now four quarters into the Ampere architecture product cycle for gaming, and it continues to be our best effort. At COMPUTEX in June, we announced two powerful new GPUs for gamers and creators, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti, and RTX 3070 Ti, delivering 50% faster performance than their prior generation with acclaimed features, such as real-time ray tracing, NVIDIA DLSS, AI rendering, Reflex, and broadcast. Laptop demand was also very strong. OEMs adopted Ampere architecture GPUs in a record number of designs. From the top of the line gaming laptops to those at mainstream price points as low as $799 that bring the power of GeForce GPUs to gamers, students, and creators on the go. Ampere architecture-powered laptops feature our third generation Max-Q power optimization technology that enables ultrathin designs, such as the new Alienware X15, the world's most powerful sub-16-millimeter gaming laptop. NVIDIA RTX technology has reset computer graphics and spurred our biggest ever refresh cycle. Ampere has been our fastest ramping gaming GPU architecture on Steam. And the combination of Turing and Ampere RTX GPUs has upgraded about 20% of our installed base. 80% have yet to upgrade to RTX. And the audience for global esports will soon approach 0.5 billion people, while the number of those who livestream games is expected to reach over 700 million. The number of PC gamers on Steam is up almost 20% over the past year. More than 60 RTX games now support NVIDIA's RTX ray tracing or DLSS, including today's biggest game franchises, such as Minecraft, Fortnite, and Cyberpunk. New RTX games this quarter include Red Dead Redemption 2, one of the top-rated games of all time, popular titles like Rainbow Six Siege and Minecraft RTX in China with over 400 million players. To competitive gamers, NVIDIA Reflex, which includes latency reduction, is now supported by 20 games. Let me say a few words on cryptocurrency mining. In an effort to address the needs of miners and direct GeForce to gamers, we increased the supply of cryptocurrency Mining Processors, or CMP, and introduced low hash rate GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability. Over 80% of our Ampere architecture base GeForce shipments in the quarter were low hash rate GPUs. The combination of cryptocurrency to gaming revenue is difficult to quantify. CMP revenue, which is recognized in OEM, was $266 million, lower than our original $400 million estimates on reduced mining profitability, and we expect a minimal contribution from CMP going forward. GeForce NOW reached a new milestone this quarter, surpassing 1,000 PC games, more than any other cloud gaming service. The premium tier is available for a subscription of $10 per month, giving gamers access to RTX class performance, even on an underpowered PC, Mac, Chromebook, iOS, or Android device. Moving to pro visualization. Q2 revenue was a record $519 million, up 40% sequentially, and up 156% year-on-year. Strong sequential revenue growth was led by desktop workstations, driven by demand to outfit home design offices as remote work becomes the norm across industries. This is also the first big quarter of the Ampere architecture ramp for pro visualization. Key verticals driving Q2 demand include automotive, public sector, and healthcare. At SIGGRAPH last week, we announced an expansion of NVIDIA Omniverse, our simulation and collaboration platform that provides the foundation of the Metaverse. Through new integrations with Blender, the world's leading open-source 3D animation tool, and Adobe, we're opening the Omniverse platform to millions of additional users. We are also collaborating with Apple and Pixar to bring advanced physics capabilities to Pixar's Universal Scene Description framework, embracing open standards to provide 3D workflows to billions of devices. Omniverse enterprise software is in the early access stage and will be generally available later this year on a subscription basis from NVIDIA's partners, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, and many others. Over 500 companies are evaluating Omniverse Enterprise, including BMW, Volvo, and Lockheed Martin. And more than 50,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since it entered open beta in December. Moving to automotive. Our Q2 revenue was $152 million, down 1% sequentially, and up 3% year-on-year. Sequential revenue declines in infotainment were largely offset by growth in self-driving. Looking further out, we have substantial design wins set to ramp that we expect will drive a major inflection in revenue in the coming years. This quarter, we announced several additional wins. Self-driving startup AutoX unveiled its latest autonomous driving platform for RoboTaxis powered by NVIDIA DRIVE. The performance and safety capabilities of the software-defined NVIDIA DRIVE platform have enabled AutoX to become one of the first companies in the world to provide full self-driving mobility services without the need for a safety driver. In autonomous trucking, DRIVE's ecosystem partner, Plus, signed a deal with Amazon to provide at least 1,000 self-driving systems to Amazon's fleet of delivery vehicles. These systems are powered by NVIDIA DRIVE for high-performance, energy-efficient, and centralized AI compute. An autonomous trucking startup Embark is building on NVIDIA DRIVE. The system is being developed for trucks for four major OEMs: Freightliner, Navistar International, PACCAR, and Volvo, representing the vast majority of class 8 or largest size trucks in the U.S. The NVIDIA DRIVE platform is being rapidly adopted across the transportation industry from passenger-owned vehicles to robotaxis to trucking and delivery vehicles. We believe everything that moves will be autonomous someday. Moving to Data Center. Revenue of $2.4 billion grew 16% sequentially, and 35% from the year-ago quarter. The year-ago quarter, which was our first quarter to include Mellanox. Growth was driven by both hyperscale customers and vertical industries, each of which has record revenues. Our flagship A100 is continuing to ramp across hyperscale and cloud computing customers, with Microsoft Azure announcing general availability in June, following AWS and Google Cloud Platforms' general availability in prior quarters. Vertical industry demand was strong, with sequential growth led by financial services, supercomputing, and telecom customers. We also had exceptional growth in Inference, which reached a record, more than doubling year-on-year. Revenue from inference-focused processors includes the new A30 GPU, which provides four times the inference performance of the T4. Customers are also turning to NVIDIA GPUs to take AI to production and shifting from CPUs to GPUs, driven by the stringent performance, latency, and cost requirements of deploying and scaling deep learning AI workloads, and NVIDIA Networking products posted solid results. We see momentum across regions driven by our technology leadership with upgrades to high-speed products, such as ConnectX-6, as well as new customer wins across cloud service providers, enterprise, and high-performance computing. We extended our leadership in supercomputing. The latest top 500 list shows that NVIDIA technologies power 342 of the world's top 500 supercomputers, including 70% of all new systems and eight of the top 10, helping companies harness the new industrial high-performance computing revolution. We deliver a turnkey AI Data Center solution with the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD, the same technology that powers our new Cambridge-1 supercomputer in the UK and a number of others in the top 500. We expanded our AI software and subscription offerings, making it easier for enterprises to adopt AIs from the initial development stage through to deployment and operations. We announced NVIDIA Base Command, our software-as-a-service offering for operating and managing large-scale, multi-user, and multi-team AI development workloads on DGX SuperPOD. Base Command is the operating and management system software for distributed training customers. We also announced the general availability of NVIDIA Fleet Command, our managed edge AI software-as-a-service offering. Fleet Command helps companies solve the problem of securely deploying and managing AI applications across thousands of remote locations, combining the efficiency and simplicity of central management with the cost performance and data sovereignty benefits of real-time processing at the edge. Early adopters of Fleet Command include some of the world's leading retail, manufacturing, and logistics companies and the specialty software companies that work with them. The new NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command software and subscription offerings followed last quarter's announcements of the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite, which is in early access with general availability expected soon. Our enterprise software strategy is supported by the NVIDIA certified system program with server OEMs, who are bringing to market over 55 systems ready to run on NVIDIA's AI software out of the box to help enterprises simplify and accelerate their AI deployment. The NVIDIA ecosystem keeps getting stronger. NVIDIA Inception, our acceleration platform for AI startups, just surpassed 8,500 members with cumulative funding of over $60 billion, with numbers in 90 countries. Inception is one of the largest AI startup ecosystems in the world. CUDA has now been downloaded 27 million times since it launched 15 years ago, with 7 million in the last year alone. TensorRT for inference has been downloaded nearly 2.5 million times across more than 27,000 companies. And the total number of developers in the NVIDIA ecosystem now exceeds 2.6 million, up four times in the past four years. Let me give you a quick update on Arm. In nearly one year since we initially agreed to combine with Arm, we have gotten to know the company, its business, and its people much better. We believe more than ever in the power of our combination, and the benefits it would deliver for Arm, for the UK, and its customers across the world in the era of AI. Arm has great potential. We appreciate their business model and commit to keeping its open licensing approach. With NVIDIA's scale and capabilities, Arm will make more IP, and sooner, for their mobile and embedded customers while expanding into Data Center, IoT, and other new markets. NVIDIA accelerates computing, which starts with the CPU. Whatever new markets open with the CPU and our accelerated computing opportunities. We've announced accelerated platforms for Amazon Graviton, Ampere Computing, MediaTek, and more about expanding cloud computing, AI, cloud gaming, Supercomputing, and Edge AI to Chrome PCs. We plan to invest in the U.K., and we have with the Cambridge-1 supercomputer. Through ARM we are making the U.K. a global center in science, technology, and AI. We are working through the regulatory process, although some Arm licensees have expressed concerns and objected to the transaction, and discussions with regulators are taking longer than initially thought. We are confident in the deal and that regulators should recognize the benefits of the acquisition to Arm, its licensees, and the industry. Moving to the rest of the P&L, the GAAP gross margin of 64.8% for the second quarter was up 600 basis points from the year earlier, reflecting the absence of certain Mellanox acquisition-related costs. GAAP gross margins were up 70 basis points sequentially, non-GAAP gross margins were 66.7%, up 70 basis points from a year earlier and up 50 basis points sequentially, reflecting higher ASPs within the desktop GPUs, our continued growth in high end and pure architecture products, partially offset by a mix shift within Data Center. Q2 GAAP EPS was $0.94, up 276% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.04, up 89% from the year-earlier, adjusting for the 4 to 1 stock split effective this quarter. Q2 cash flow from operations was a record $2.7 billion. Let me turn to the outlook for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2022. We expect another strong quarter with sequential growth driven largely by accelerating demand in Data Center. In addition, we expect sequential growth in each of our three other market platforms. Gaming demand is continuing to exceed supply as we expect channel inventories to remain below target levels as we exit Q3. The contribution of CMP to our revenue outlook is minimal. Revenue is expected to be $6.8 billion plus or minus 2%, GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.96 billion and $1.37 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses on equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be approximately 11%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 million to $225 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the following virtual events: The BMO Technology Summit on August 24th, the New Street Big Ideas in Semiconductors Conference on September 9th, the Citi Global Tech Conference on September 13, the Piper Sandler Global Technology Conference on September 14th, and the Evercore ISI Auto Check and AI Forum on September 21st. Our earnings call to discuss the third-quarter results is scheduled for Wednesday, November 17th.",

And then longer-term, Jensen, we've seen a lot of announcements from NVIDIA about your Enterprise software opportunity. I honestly don't know how to model that. It sounds very promising, but how should we model it? What problem are you trying to solve? Is it cannibalizing demand you might have otherwise seen from your public Cloud customers, or is this incremental to growth? So just any guidance or any insights into how to think about NVIDIA's Enterprise software opportunity longer-term? Thank you.",

          "content": "Yes, thanks for the question. We are seeing accelerated growth, as we've already reported that we have record revenues in both hyperscale cloud and industrial enterprise this last quarter. And we're seeing accelerated growth. The exploration in hyperscale and cloud comes from the transitioning of the cloud service providers in taking their AI applications, which are now heavily deep learning-driven into production. There were some things that we've spoken about in the past that make Vinny the ideal partner to scale up with. And there are several elements of our platform. Number one, Ampere GPU, which is now a universal GPU for AI, for training, but incredibly efficient for inference; its throughput is terrific, and it's a fast response client as well. Therefore, the cost of deployment and the cost of operating the AI applications is the lowest. The second is the introduction of TensorRT, which is our optimizing compiler that makes it possible for us to compile and optimize any AI application to our GPUs. Whether it's computer vision or natural language understanding or conversational AI or recommender systems, the types of applications that are deploying AIs are really quite vast. And then lastly, this software Inference server that we offer is called Triton, which supports every one of our GPUs. It supports CPUs as well as GPUs still. So every internet service provider could operate their entire data center using Triton. These several things are really accelerating our growth. So the first element is the deployment and transition of deep learning AI applications into large-scale deployment. In the Enterprise, every enterprise wants to become a tech company and take advantage of connected clouds, connected devices, and artificial intelligence to achieve it. They have an opportunity to deploy AI services at the edge. To do so, several things must happen. First, we must create a computing platform that allows them to do training in the IT environment that they understand, which is virtualized, and is largely managed by VMware. Our collaboration with VMware, creating a new type of system that could be integrated into the Enterprise is a significant effort, and it's in volume production today. Secondly, a server that allows enterprise customers to deploy their AI models to the edge. The AI engine, the software suite that we've been developing over the last 10 years, is now integrated into this environment and allows enterprises to run AI at scale. There are three elements of our product there. For instance, NVIDIA AI Enterprise basically puts all the state-of-the-art AI solvers and engines and libraries that we've industrialized and perfected over the years for Enterprise licensing. The second is an operating system platform called Base Command that allows for distributed software development for training and developing models, and then the third is Fleet Command, which is an operating system software product that lets you operate, deploy, and manage AI models at the edge. These three software products, in combination with the server called NVIDIA Certified, taken out through our network of partners is our strategy to accelerate AI adoption by Enterprise customers. We are enthusiastic about entering into the software business model. This is an opportunity that could represent tens of millions of servers, which we could link with GPU acceleration, and we believe that Enterprises will deploy AI to revolutionize the industry. Using a traditional enterprise software licensing business model, this could represent billions of dollars of profits.",

I've been reviewing your gaming revenues, which have seen a consistent increase of about 10% or 11% for three consecutive quarters. My understanding is that this is due to your ability to secure supply. Can you explain what the supply situation looks like as you transition from Q2 to Q3? Do you believe you can maintain that level of sequential growth, or will it decrease? I also need to consider your other comments indicating that sequential growth, presumably in dollar terms, will primarily be driven by Data Center.

Now excluding CMP, we expect our revenue to grow over $500 million sequentially. A lion's share of that sequential revenue increase will be coming from Data Center. We do expect gaming to be up slightly on a sequential basis, but remember we are still supply constrained. Automotive and Pro visualization are also expected to be up slightly quarter-over-quarter. From the CMP perspective, we'll probably just have minimal amounts in Q3. So our Q3 results don't have seasonality with them for gaming and are really about the supply that we believe we can have for Q3. I'll see if Jensen wants to add any more details.",

This technology called ray tracing has been the holy grail of computer graphics for quite a long time, and with our NVIDIA research for 10 years, we finally made it possible to do real-time ray tracing with RTX. RTX's demand is quite incredible, and as you know, we have a large install base that uses an architecture called GTX based on programmable shaders that we invented some 20 years ago. Now, we've reset the entire installed base, and Ampere is off to an incredible start, the best-selling GPU architecture in the history of our company. Yet, we've only upgraded some 20% - less than 20% of our total installed base still. There's another 80% of the world's PC gaming market that we have yet to upgrade to RTX. Meanwhile, the number of PC gamers in the world grew substantially. Steam grew 20% this last year. So I think we're right at the beginning of our RTX transition. Meanwhile, computer graphics has expanded into so many different new markets. RTX, we've always believed, would reinvent the way people do design, and we're seeing that happening right now as we speak. Workstations are growing faster than ever and have achieved record revenues. Because of all our work with cloud gaming, we now see public clouds putting in cloud graphics, whether it's workstations or PCs or private gaming consoles up in the Cloud. So we're seeing strong demand in PCs, laptops, workstations, and mobile workstations in the cloud. RTX has been doing really great.

The workstation market is really doing great. The backdrop of that, of course, is that people are building offices in their homes. For many designers and creators, they have to create a workstation or an office at home as well as one at work. RTX has changed that landscape significantly. Meanwhile, RTX has reached all our consumer graphics with a 200 million installed base of PC gamers, and it's time to upgrade. We expect to have enough supply to meet our second-half Company growth plans and to achieve our growth plans for next year.

The first is the transition you're talking about. The world's data centers are now users for computing costs just aggregated, which enables a single application to run on multiple servers simultaneously. This makes it possible for them to scale up effectively. The more users there are for an AI application or service, you just have to add more servers. The ease of scaling out that this aggregated computing provides also puts enormous pressure on networking. Mellanox has the world's lowest latency and the highest bandwidth and performance networking on the planet. So the ability to scale out and provide this aggregation is much better with Mellanox networking. The second dynamic is that almost every company in the world needs to be a high-performance computing company now. Cloud service providers are building effective supercomputers. Historically, that was the realm of supercomputing firms, but now the cloud-service providers are building supercomputers themselves because of the requirements of deploying deep learning and artificial intelligence applications. The rate of growth of network sizes AI models is doubling every two months. You're seeing supercomputers grow in enterprises around the world. The third dynamic is the software-defined data center. To orchestrate and run a data center, just a few people are essentially running thousands of servers. That entire data center is software-defined. The amount of software that goes into that data center is extreme, and it's putting enormous pressure on the available computing capacity for applications. Data centers are moving towards a zero-trust model, and Bluefield is incredibly well-positioned. I appreciate this opportunity to share and I am very excited about the prospects in the networking business and the essential role they play in creating modern data centers.",

The automation opportunities that drive productivity translate directly into cost savings for companies and open up opportunities for technology and computing companies. Let me just give you some examples. The fact that we can apply technology in warehouse logistics, retail automation, and customer call center automation is unprecedented. The fact that we can automate truck driving and provide an automated chauffeur is something that was unimaginable before. The size of the IT industry has expanded like never before, and we want to invest as smartly and as quickly as we can to address large business opportunities where we can make a real impact while doing so in an architecturally sensible way. One of the great advantages of our company is the way we build products, our software discipline, our architectural efficiency. This enables us to address a wide range of areas like climate science, digital biology, artificial intelligence, robotics, and self-driving cars, while maintaining operating leverage.

As you recall, what we put in place was the low hash rate cards, along with industry mandates on cards. The low hash rate cards were designed to provide more supply for our GeForce gamers that are out there. We articulated one of the metrics that we're looking at is what percentage of those cards in Ampere we were able to sell with low hash rate cards. Almost all our cards in Ampere are low hash rates, but we're also selling other types of cards as well. At this time, as we move forward, we're much higher than 80%, but just at the end of this last quarter, we were approximately at 80.

There are several reasons why the situation is different this time. The first is that the LHR, which is new, and the speed at which we responded with CMPs, effectively pointed GeForce toward our gaming business. The second is that we are at the beginning of the Ampere and RTX graphics cycle. RTX was a complete reinvention of computer graphics, and every evidence indicates that gamers and game developers are incredibly excited about ray tracing and rendering. Most significantly, we've only upgraded a small fraction of our installed base and there remains a large number yet to be upgraded.

These virtual worlds can be used for various applications such as concert simulations for consumers, and in the industrial space, you could use it for simulating robots. In fact, you could simulate factories entirely in Omniverse, which we have done with BMW. This factory becomes a digital twin to explore new algorithms and AIs to optimize operations. Omniverse presents an opportunity for an overlay of virtual and physical worlds, a vision that aligns with what many companies are calling the Metaverse. In our case, this extends into industrial design and engineering space. You'll be able to wormhole into these worlds using VR and collapse the boundaries of traditional design and engineering, creating a significant new economy that will become larger than our current economy. Omniverse is an extension of our AI and high-performance computing strategies and enhances how industries create digital tools to simulate their physical world. Thank you. We had an excellent quarter fueled by surging demand for NVIDIA computing. Our pioneering work in accelerated computing continues to impact graphics and scientific computing with AI. Enabled by NVIDIA accelerated computing, developers create the most impactful technologies of our time. From natural language understanding to autonomous vehicles and logistics centers to climate science research, the Metaverse obeys the laws of physics. This quarter we announced NVIDIA Base Command and Fleet Command to develop, deploy, scale, and orchestrate AI workflows on the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software suite. With our new Enterprise Software, a wide range of NVIDIA-powered systems, and a global network of system and integration partners, we can accelerate the world's largest industry as they reap the benefits of the transformative power of AI. We launched NVIDIA Omniverse, a simulation platform nearly five years in the making that runs physically realistic virtual worlds and connects to other digital platforms. We imagine engineers, designers, and autonomous machines connecting to Omniverse to create digital twin simulated worlds that help train robots, operating autonomous factories, simulating fleets of autonomous vehicles, and even predicting the human impact on Earth\u2019s climate. The future will have artificial intelligence augmenting our own and the Metaverse augmenting our physical world. It will be populated by real and AI visitors, and open new opportunities for artists, designers, scientists, and businesses\u2014a whole new digital economy. Omniverse is a platform for building the Metaverse vision, and we are working on some of our best and most impactful projects in our history. Thank you to all NVIDIA's employees for their hard work and the exciting future we're inventing together. See you next time.",

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. Q3 was an outstanding quarter with revenue of $7.1 billion and year-on-year growth of 50%. We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.2 billion was up 5% sequentially and up 42% from a year earlier. Demand was strong across the board. While we continued to increase desktop GPU supply, we believe channel inventories remain low. Laptop GPUs also posted strong year-on-year growth, led by increased demand for high-end RTX laptops. NVIDIA RTX technology is driving our biggest ever refresh cycle with gamers and continues to expand our base with creators. RTX introduced groundbreaking real-time ray tracing and AI-enabled super resolution capabilities, which are getting adopted at an accelerating pace. More than 200 games and applications now support NVIDIA RTX, including 125 with NVIDIA DLSS. This quarter alone, 45 new games shipped with DLSS. And NVIDIA Reflex Latency Reducing Technology is in top esports titles, including Valorant, Fortnite, Apex Legends and Overwatch. In addition, the Reflex ecosystem continues to grow with Reflex technology now integrated into almost 50 gaming peripherals. NVIDIA Studio for creators keeps expanding. Last month at the Adobe MAX Creativity Conference, Adobe announced two powerful AI features for Adobe Lightroom and Lightroom Classic, accelerated by NVIDIA RTX GPUs. In addition, several of our partners launched new studio systems, including Microsoft, HP and ASUS. We estimate that a quarter of our installed base has adopted RTX GPUs. Looking ahead, we expect continued upgrades as well as growth from NVIDIA GeForce users, given rapidly expanding RTX support and the growing popularity of gaming, esports, content creation, and streaming. Our GPUs are capable of crypto mining, but we don't have visibility into how much this impacts our overall GPU demand. In Q3, nearly all of our Ampere architecture gaming desktop GPU shipments were lite hash rate to help steer GeForce supply to gamers. Crypto mining processor revenue was $105 million, which is included in our OEM and other. Our cloud gaming service, GeForce Now, has two major achievements this quarter. First, Electronic Arts brought more of its hit games to the server. And second, we announced the new GeForce Now RTX 3080 membership tier, priced at less than $100 for six months. GeForce Now membership has more than doubled in this last year to over 14 million gamers for streaming content from 30 data centers in more than 80 countries. Moving to Pro Visualization. Q3 revenue of $577 million was up 11% sequentially and up 144% from the year ago quarter. The sequential rise was led by mobile workstations with desktop workstations also growing, as enterprises deployed systems to support the hybrid work environment. Building on the strong initial ramp in Q2, Ampere architecture sales continue to grow, leading verticals including media and entertainment, healthcare, public sector and automotive. Last week, we announced the general availability of Omniverse Enterprise, a platform for simulating physically accurate 3D worlds and digital twins. Initial market reception to Omniverse has been incredible. Professionals at over 700 companies are evaluating the platform, including BMW, Ericsson, Lockheed Martin, and Sony Pictures. More than 70,000 individual creators have downloaded Omniverse since the open beta launch in December. There are approximately 40 million 3D designers in the global market. Moving to Automotive. Q3 revenue of $135 million declined 11% sequentially and increased 8% from the year ago quarter. The sequential decline was primarily driven by AI cockpit revenue, which has negatively been impacted by automotive manufacturers' supply constraints. We announced that self-driving truck startup, Kodiak Robotics; automaker, Lotus; autonomous bus manufacturers, QCraft; and EV startup, WM Motor, have adopted the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin platform for their next-generation vehicles. They join a large and rapidly growing list of companies adopting and developing on NVIDIA DRIVE, including auto OEMs, Tier 1 suppliers, NAVs, trucking companies, mobile taxis and software startups. Moving to Data Center. Record revenue of $2.9 billion grew 24% sequentially and 55% from the year ago quarter with record revenue across both hyperscale and vertical industries. Strong growth was led by hyperscale customers, fueled by continued rapid adoption of Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs for both internal and external workloads. Hyperscale compute revenue doubled year-on-year, driven by the scale-out of natural language processing and recommendation models and cloud computing. Vertical industry growth was also strong, led by consumer Internet and broader cloud providers. For example, Barco Cloud deployed NVIDIA GPUs for its launch of AI services, such as tech analysis, speech recognition, computer vision, and anomaly detection. We continue to achieve exceptional growth and influence, which again outpaced our overall Data Center growth. We have transitioned our lineup of infant-focused processes to the Ampere architecture, such as the A30 GPU. We also released the latest version of our Triton Inference Server software, enabling compute-intensive inference workloads such as large language models to scale across multiple GPUs and nodes with real-time performance. Over 25,000 companies worldwide use NVIDIA AI inference. A great new example is Microsoft Teams, which has nearly 250 million monthly active users. It uses NVIDIA AI to convert speech to text in real time during video calls in 28 languages in a cost-effective way. We reached three milestones to help drive more mainstream enterprise adoption of NVIDIA AI. First, we announced the general availability of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, a comprehensive software suite with AI tools and frameworks that enable the hundreds of thousands of companies running NVIDIA, running vSphere to virtualize AI workloads on NVIDIA-certified systems. Second, VMware announced a future update to vSphere with Tanzu that is fully optimized for NVIDIA AI. When it's combined with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, enterprises can efficiently manage cloud-native AI development and deployment on mainstream data center servers and clouds with existing IT tools. And third, we expanded our launch cloud program globally with Ethernet as our first digital infrastructure partner. NVIDIA LaunchPad is now available in nine locations worldwide, providing enterprises with immediate access to NVIDIA software and infrastructure to help them prototype and test data science and AI workloads. LaunchPad features NVIDIA-certified systems and NVIDIA DGX systems running the entire NVIDIA AI software stack. In networking, revenue was impacted as demand outstripped supply. We saw momentum toward higher speed and new generation products, including ConnectX-5 and 6. We announced the NVIDIA Quantum-2 400 gigabit per second end-to-end networking platform, consisting of the Quantum-2 switch, the ConnectX-7 network adapter, and the BlueField-3 DPU. The NVIDIA Quantum-2, which is available from a wide range of building infrastructure and system vendors around the world. Earlier this week, the latest top 500 list of supercomputers showed continued momentum for our full stack computing approach. NVIDIA's technologies accelerate over 70% of the systems, including over 90% of all new systems and 23 of the top 25 most energy-efficient systems. Turning to GTC. Last week, we hosted our GPU Technology Conference, which had over 270,000 registered attendees. Jensen's keynote has been viewed 25 million times over the past eight days. While our Spring GTC is focused on new chips and systems, this edition focused on software, demonstrating our full computing stack. Let me cover some of the highlights. Our vision for Omniverse came to life at GTC. We significantly expanded this ecosystem and announced new capabilities. Omniverse replication is an engine for producing data to train robots, replicating and augmenting real-world data with massive, diverse, and physically accurate synthetic data sets to both accelerate the development of high-quality, high-performance AI across computing demand. NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar is our platform for generating interactive AI avatars. It connects several core NVIDIA SDKs including speech AI, computer vision, natural language understanding, recommendation engines, and simulation. Applications include automated customer service, virtual collaboration, and content solutions. Replicator and Avatar joined several other announced features and capabilities for Omniverse, including AI, AR, VR, and simulation-based technologies. We introduced 65 new and updated software development kits, bringing our total to more than 150, serving industries from gaming and design to AI, cybersecurity, 5G, and robotics. One of the SDKs is our first fully licensed AI model, NVIDIA Riva, for building conversational AI applications. Companies using Riva during the open beta include RingCentral for video conference live captioning and Pigeon for customer service chatbots. NVIDIA Riva Enterprise will be commercially available early next year. For launch, we introduced NVIDIA's NeMo Megatron optimized for training large language models on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD infrastructure. This combination brings together production-ready, enterprise-grade hardware and software in both vertical industries, developing language and industry-specific dropboxes, personal systems, content generation, and summarization. Early adopters include SiDi, JD.com, and VinBrain. We unveiled BlueField DOCA 1.2, the latest version of our GPU programming language with new cybersecurity capabilities. DOCA is to our GPUs as CUDA is to our GPUs. It enables developers to build applications and services on top of our BlueField DOCA. Our new capabilities make BlueField the ideal platform for the industry to build their zero trust security platforms. The leading cybersecurity companies are working with us to provision their next-generation firewall service on BlueField, including Checkpoint, Juniper, Borgne, F5, Palo Alto Networks, and VMware. We also released Clara Holoscan, an edge AI computing platform for medical instruments to improve decision-making tools in areas such as robo-assisted surgery, interventional radiology, and radiation therapy planning. Other new or expanded SDKs or libraries unveiled at GTC include ReOpt for AI-optimized logistics, Quantum for quantum computing, Morpheus for cybersecurity, Modulus for physical-based machine learning, and Crunet Numeric, a data center scale mass library to bring accelerated computing to the large and growing Python ecosystem. All in, NVIDIA's computing platform continues to expand as a broadening set of SDKs enables more and more GPU-accelerated applications and industry use cases. CUDA has been downloaded 30 million times, and our developer ecosystem is now nearing 3 million strong. The applications they develop on top of our SDK and the cloud-to-edge computing platform are helping to transform multitrillion dollar industries from healthcare to transportation to mental services, manufacturing, logistics, and virtual reality. In Automotive, we announced NVIDIA DRIVE Concierge and DRIVE Chauffeur, AI software platforms that enhance a vehicle's performance, features, and safety. Live Concierge builds on Omniverse Avatar and functions as an AI-based in-vehicle personal assistant, enabling automatic parking and summoning capabilities. It also enhances safety by monitoring the driver throughout the duration of the drive. DRIVE Chauffeur offers autonomous capabilities, relieving the driver of constantly having to control the car. It will also perform address-to-address driving when combined with the DRIVE Hyperion 8 platform. For robotics, we announced Jetson AGX Orin, the world's smallest, most powerful, and energy-efficient AI supercomputer for robotics, autonomous missions, and embedded computing at the edge. Built on our Ampere architecture, Jetson AGX Orin provides 6 times the processing power of its predecessor and delivers 200 trillion operations per second, similar to a GPU-enabled server that fits into the palm of your hand. Jetson AGX Orin will be available in the first quarter of calendar 2022. Finally, we revealed plans to build Earth-2, the world's most powerful AI supercomputer dedicated to confronting climate change. The system would be the climate change counterpart to Cambridge-1, the U.K.'s most powerful AI supercomputer that we built for corporate research. Earth-2 furnishes all the technologies we've invented up to this moment. Let me discuss Arm. I'll provide you a brief update on our proposed acquisition of Arm. Arm with NVIDIA is a great opportunity for the industry and customers with NVIDIA's scale, capabilities, and robust understanding of data center computing, acceleration, and AI. We assessed Arm in expanding their reach into data centers, IoT, and PCs, and advanced Arm's IP for decades to come. The combination of our companies can enhance competition in the industry as we work together on further building the world of AI. Regulators at the U.S. FTC have expressed concerns regarding the transaction and we are engaged in discussions with them regarding remedies to address those concerns. The transaction has been under review by the China Antitrust Authority, pending the formal case initiation. Regulators in the U.K. and the EU have declined to approve the transaction in Phase 1 of their reviews on competition concerns. In the U.K., they have also voiced national security concerns. We have begun the Phase 2 process in the EU and U.K. jurisdictions. Despite these concerns and those raised by some Arm licensees, we continue to believe in the merits and the benefits of the acquisition for Arm, its licensees, and the industry. We believe these concerns raised by some Arm licensees do not invalidate the merits of the ongoing acquisition. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was up 260 basis points from a year earlier, primarily due to higher end mix within desktop, notebook, and GeForce GPUs. The year-on-year increase also benefited from a reduced impact of acquisition-related costs. GAAP gross margin was up 40 basis points sequentially, driven by growth in our Data Center Ampere architecture products, which was particularly offset by the mix in gaming. Non-gaming gross margin was up 150 basis points from a year earlier and up 30 basis points sequentially. Q3 GAAP EPS was $0.97, 83% from a year earlier. Non-GAAP EPS was $1.17, up 60% from a year ago, adjusting for our stock split. Q3 cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion, up from $1.3 billion a year earlier and down from $2.7 billion in the prior quarter. The year-on-year increase primarily reflects higher operating income, particularly offset by prepayment for long-term supply agreements. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. We expect sequential growth to be driven by Data Center and Gaming, more than offsetting a decline in CMP. Revenue is expected to be $7.4 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.3% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.02 billion and $1.43 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $60 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are both expected to be 11%, plus or minus 1% excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million to $275 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary. Other information is also available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Credit Suisse 25th Annual Technology Conference in person on November 30th. We will also be at the Wells Fargo Fifth Annual TMT Summit virtually on December 1st, the UBS Global TMT Virtual Conference on December 6th, and the Deutsche Bank Virtual Auto Tech Conference on December 9th. Our earnings call to discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 results is scheduled for Wednesday, February 16. With that, we will now open the call for questions.

I guess the simple question is, Jensen, how do you define success in Omniverse as we look out over the next, let's call it, 12 months and how do we think about the subscription license opportunity for Omniverse? I know you've talked about $40 million total 3D designers, I think that actually doubled what you talked about back in August. So I'm just curious how we at finance line should probably think about that opportunity materializing?",

        {
          "speaker": "Jensen Huang",
          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "Yes. Thanks. Omniverse success will be defined by, number one, developer engagement, connecting with developers around the world; two, applications being developed by enterprises; three, the connection between designers and creators among themselves. Those are the nearest-term metrics. And I would say that in my definition, etc. Near term also should be revenues, and Omniverse has real immediate applications as I demonstrated at the keynote and I'll highlight a few of them right now. One of them, of course, is that it serves as a way to connect the 3D and digital design world. Think of Adobe as a world, think of Autodesk as a world, think of Revit as a world. These are design worlds in the sense that people are doing things in them, they are creating things in them and they have to run databases. We made it possible for these worlds to be connected for the very first time and for it to be shared like in cloud documents. That's not been possible ever before, and we can now share work with each other; you can see each other's work; you can collaborate. And so in the world of remote working, Omniverse's collaboration capability is going to be really appreciated, and that should happen right away. We would like to see that happen in the very near term. And that drives, of course, more PC sales, more GPU sales, more workstation sales, more server sales. The second use case is digital twins. We show in these following examples how several companies using Omniverse to create a digital twin of a city so that they could optimize radio placements and radio energy used for beamforming. You saw BMW using it for their factories. You're going to see people using it for warehouse logistics to plan and to optimize their warehouses and deploying the robots. And so digital twin applications are absolutely immediate. And then remember, robots have several clients. There is the physical robot that you saw, and a physical robot would be a self-driving car, and physical robots would be the car itself, turning it into a robot so that it could be an intelligent assistant. But I demonstrated probably in my explanation the largest application of robots in the future and its avatars. We built Omniverse Avatars to make it easy for people to integrate some amazing technology for computer vision, for speech recognition, natural language understanding, gesture recognition, facial animation and speech synthesis, recommender systems, all of that integrated into one system and running in real time. That Avatar system is essentially a robotic system and the way you use that is, for example, with $25 million or so retail stores, restaurants, places like airports and train stations, office buildings, and such, where you're going to have intelligent Avatars doing a lot of assistance. They might be doing checkout, they might be doing check-in, they might be doing customer support, and all of that can be done with Avatars, as I've demonstrated. So the virtual robotics application, digital buys of Avatars, are going to be likely the largest robotics opportunity. So if you look at our licensing model, the way it basically works is that inside Omniverse is one of the main users, and the main users could be one of the 20 million creators or 20 million designers and the 40 million creators and designers around the world, and they share Omniverse; each one of the main users would be $1,000 per user per year. But don't forget that intelligent use or intelligent users that have been connected through Omniverse will likely be much larger as digital buyers than humans. So I mentioned 40 million, but there are 100 million cars. And these 100 million cars will have the capability to have something like an Omniverse Avatar, and so those 100 million cars could be $1,000 per car per year. And in the case of the 25 million or so places where you would have a digital avatar as customer support, or checkout smart retail or smart warehouses or whatever it is, those avatars also would each individually be a new account and so they would be $1,000 per Avatar per year. And so those are the immediate tangible opportunities for us, and I demonstrate the applications in related keynotes. And then, of course, behind all of that, call it a couple of hundred million digital agents, intelligent agents, some of them humans, some of them robots, some of them avatars, adds $1,000 per agent per year. Behind it are NVIDIA GPUs in PC, NVIDIA GPU in cloud, and NVIDIA GPUs in Omniverse servers. And my guess would be that the hardware part of it is probably going to be about half, and then the licensing part of it is probably about half of the time. So this is really going to be one of the largest graphics opportunities that we've ever seen. And the reason why it's taken so long for us to manifest is that it requires three fundamental technologies to come together, I guess four fundamental technologies to come together. First, it\u2019s video graphics; second is physics simulation, because we're talking about things in a world that has to be believable, so it has to obey the laws of physics; and then third is artificial intelligence, as I demonstrated and illustrated just now. And all of it runs on top of an Omniverse computer that has to do not just AI, not just physics, not just computer graphics, but all of it. And so long term why people are so excited about it is, at the highest level what it basically means is that long-term when we engage in that, which is largely 2D today, long-term every query would be 3D and instead of just querying information, we would query and interact with people and avatars and things and places and all of these things are in 3D. So hopefully one of these days that we will realize it as fast as we can every transaction that goes on to the internet touches a GPU, and today that's a very small percentage, but hopefully one of these days it will be a bit of a high percentage. So I hope that's helpful.",

Jensen, every year it seems like there are new demand drivers for your accelerated platform and processing ecosystem, such as gaming, neural networks, AI, blockchain, and ray tracing. Five or six years ago, you presented some exciting virtual reality demos at your Analyst Day. While the excitement diminished, it appears to be returning, especially with the capabilities of Omniverse Avatar and Facebook highlighting the potential. My two questions are: how close is your Omniverse Avatar to becoming a mass-market technology that everyone uses daily? You mentioned that everyone is going to be a gamer and an Omniverse Avatar user. Also, is it reasonable to expect new killer apps to emerge every year? Should we draw parallels with previous computing markets for the current computing landscape we are entering? Thank you.",

          "content": "Yes, I really appreciate that. Chips enable functionality, but they do not create markets; that role belongs to software. Over the years, I've explained that accelerated computing vastly differs from general-purpose computing. You cannot simply input quantum physics into a compiler and expect it to function correctly on a chip. It's not as straightforward as compiling Schr\u00f6dinger's equation across multiple GPUs or nodes to generate a new SaaS. The same applies to fields like computer graphics, artificial intelligence, and robotics\u2014most innovative applications cannot be simplified into that model. We've reached a limit with GPUs. People recognize that while it\u2019s not impossible to extract parallel instructions from a system, it's extremely challenging. There is an alternative approach, which we've been promoting for some time, and now more people are beginning to see its advantages. However, it requires substantial effort. For each application within a large domain, a comprehensive stack must be developed. To launch a new market by accelerating these applications, a new stack must be created, which is a daunting task requiring a deep understanding of the application, algorithms, mathematics, and computer science. Transforming a single-threaded process into a multi-threaded one disrupts various components like storage and networking, making it a complex challenge. Over the years, we have evolved into a full-stack company to address these issues. Once expertise is acquired, new markets can be explored. We have played a significant role in democratizing artificial intelligence, allowing broader access to technology for researchers and scientists to enhance their work. Each year, we introduce new stacks, with many developments visible as they come together. One focus area we've discussed is Omniverse, which took half a decade to develop while building on 25 years of foundational work. In the case of Omniverse Avatar, you can directly connect it to technologies like MERLIN for recommendations, Megatron for language processing, and Riva for speech AI, among others. These technologies, while developed separately, have been integrated to create Omniverse Avatar. Regarding deployment, I anticipate that Omniverse Avatar will be utilized in fast-food restaurants and retail locations worldwide within five years. This technology addresses the labor shortage effectively, providing a reliable, tireless, and always-available solution. Our cloud-native approach, as demonstrated in our keynote, enables instantaneous interaction and a pleasant conversational experience. To summarize, accelerated computing presents a complex, full-stack challenge. It is software that opens new markets, not chips. While new chips may capture market share, they do not create new opportunities. At NVIDIA, we leverage software to access significant market prospects. Lastly, I view Omniverse as a near-term opportunity that we've been developing for three to five years.",

And within this outlook, can you talk to traditional cloud versus industry verticals and then perhaps emerging opportunities like Omniverse and others? Would love to get a sense of kind of what you're seeing today. And then as part of that, how you're planning to secure foundry and other supply to support that growth? Thank you.",

          "content": "Thank you, C.J. We have secured a substantial guaranteed supply from the world's leading foundry, which is a crucial part of our supply chain. We feel confident about our supply situation, especially starting in the second half of this year and moving forward. Last year served as a reminder for everyone to be more aware of the importance of the supply chain, and we are fortunate to have excellent partners that have helped ensure our future. Regarding our Data Center business, approximately half comes from cloud service providers and the other half from various enterprise companies, with just 1% coming from supercomputing centers. We anticipate that next year, cloud service providers will aggressively expand their deep learning and AI workloads, a trend we are already witnessing. We have developed an exceptional platform. Our work with TensorRT and its integration into the Triton server is one of our most significant achievements, and we take great pride in it. Nearly four years ago, we highlighted that inference would pose major challenges in computer science, and this has proven to be true due to varying needs for throughput, latency, and interactivity across different models. This complexity stems from the diverse architectures and application types involved. We are now on our 8th generation of this technology, which is widely adopted globally, with around 25,000 companies utilizing NVIDIA AI. Recently at GTC, we announced two major developments. First, we introduced tools to manage AI deployment across all generations of NVIDIA GPUs, making it essential for operating NVIDIA servers worldwide. Secondly, we now support CPUs, allowing customers to streamline their inference servers to just one, with Triton being a fundamental element.  Additionally, we unveiled the Forced Inference Library (FIL), which supports widely used machine learning systems based on decision trees, such as XGBoost. This approach is prevalent in areas like fraud detection and recommendation systems due to its extensibility. Furthermore, Triton will now support multi-GPU and multi-node inference, enabling real-time interaction with large language models like OpenAI's GPT-3 and NVIDIA's Megatron 530B. I showcased a model capable of answering questions in real time during a demonstration. These advancements will enable us to continue scaling and innovating.  To return to your initial inquiry, we expect Data Center growth to be robust next year. Customers are increasingly focused on securing their supply chains for expansion, and our visibility within the Data Center space has improved significantly. Triton is experiencing widespread adoption, and we are also working on new AI-based workloads within our Omniverse platform. We identified customer support as an area facing significant shortages globally, presenting an opportunity for Omniverse Avatar. This platform can be adapted for various applications, such as drive-thrus and customer service, which I demonstrated using a Tokyo parking kiosk. Omniverse Avatar has potential in tele-operated customer service and robotics, exemplified by our DRIVE Concierge service that transforms vehicles into intelligent assistant agents. I believe Omniverse Avatar will be a significant driver for enterprise growth next year, leading to a promising outlook for the Data Center sector.",

On the near term, Colette, you suggested guidance in the Q4 be driven by Data Center and gaming, and you mentioned data center first. Does that mean that it's bigger? If you could just help us like parse the contribution of each into Q4? And then in the next year, given the commentary for the last question, again it sounds like you've got like a very strong outlook for Data Center both from hyperscale and enterprise. If I look at sort of the implied guidance you gave, Data Center for you is probably likely to grow 50% year-over-year in this fiscal year. Would it be crazy to think given all the drivers that it could grow by a similar amount next year as well?

We also expect our CMP product to decline quarter-on-quarter to very negligible levels in Q4. So I hope that gives you a color on Q4. Now in terms of next year, we'll certainly turn the corner into the new fiscal year. We certainly provide guidance one quarter out. We've given you some great discussions here about the opportunities in front of us, opportunities with the hyperscales, the opportunities with the verticals. Omniverse is a full stack opportunity in front of us. We are securing supply for next year, not just for the current year and Q4, to allow us to really grow into so much of this opportunity going forward.

These are areas of capacity agreements and/or many of our different suppliers. We made a payment within this quarter of approximately $1.6 billion out of a total long-term capacity agreement of about $3.4 billion.

          "content": "Every single server will eventually be GPU-accelerated. Currently, less than 10% of clouds and enterprises utilize this technology. Many workloads still rely solely on CPUs, which is why we need to be a full-stack company and actively seek out applications. We need to identify numerous applications that can either require or greatly benefit from acceleration. Achieving a million times speed up may sound extreme, but it's mathematically feasible and has historically been demonstrated in many sectors, including computer graphics, which is essential for Omniverse. Our work in digital biology and protein synthesis is set to become a significant industry that doesn't exist yet, and protein engineering will be substantial. Accomplishing this requires million times speed up in protein biology simulations. Climate science also needs massive speed up, and we are at a stage where we can address that. In each scenario, we must focus our resources to accelerate applications, which will drive growth. Currently, many speech synthesis and recognition systems still rely on traditional or a mix of traditional and deep learning approaches. NVIDIA Riva is the first end-to-end deep neural network for this purpose. We have helped numerous companies transition to our neural-based approaches, providing references and licensing so they can apply it for their own cases. We need to accelerate one application after another, and one area we are particularly excited about is Electronic Design Automation. For the first time, we've announced EDA utilizing GPU-accelerated computing, thanks to artificial intelligence capabilities. EDA involves significant combinatorial optimization, and AI can greatly enhance design quality and speed. Major game vendors, chip design firms, and PCB design industries are increasingly adopting AI and GPU acceleration. Traditional CAD applications are now also benefiting from considerable speed improvements. I'm thrilled about our progress in these areas, as every advancement opens up new markets and attracts customers who have never previously utilized NVIDIA GPUs. Ultimately, people don't just buy chips; they seek solutions to problems.

Our largest driver always continues to be mix. We have a lot of different mix that has driven related to the high-end AI and RTX solutions, for example, and the software that is embedded in solutions has allowed us to increase our gross margin.

We set records for total revenue as well as for Gaming, Data Center and Professional Visualization. Full year revenue was a record $26.9 billion, up 61%, compounding the prior year's growth of 53%. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.4 billion rose 6% sequentially and was up 37% from a year earlier. Fiscal year revenue of $12.5 billion was up 61%. Gaming has become the top entertainment medium that continues to show strong momentum. Just last month, Steam hit a record 28 million concurrent users, up 50% in two years. Record desktop revenue in the quarter was led by our growth in our GeForce RTX 30 Series products with continued strength in the high end. At CES, we announced the RTX 3050 GPO, which hit retail in late January, bringing NVIDIA RTX and AI technologies to more mainstream audiences. Laptop gaming revenue also set a record, driven by the ramp of the new GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and 3080 Ti GPUs, which were also announced at CES. These leverage our fourth-generation Max-Q technology to enable quiet thin and light gaming laptops. All in, we announced over 160 new laptop designs for NVIDIA and tier architecture RTX 30 Series GPUs. These include a number of studio systems targeting the tens of millions of creators driving the future of design, innovation and virtual world. In addition to supporting the new RTX 30 Series GPUs, Studio laptops will support NVIDIA software with Omniverse, Tundus and Broadcast. Availability of our gaming products in the channel remains low. The NVIDIA RTX ecosystem continues to expand with over 30 new RTX games and applications added this quarter, including blockbuster hits like Battlefield 2042, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty: Vanguard and God of War. In addition, several new titles support NVIDIA Reflex for low-latency impact. Our GPUs are capable of cryptocurrency mining, so we have limited visibility into how much of this impacts our overall GPU demand. Nearly all desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments are light cache rate to help direct GeForce supply to gamers. Cryptomining processor revenue was $24 million, which is included in OEM and other. We continue to expand the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming ecosystem with new hit titles, including EA's Battlefield IV and Battlefield V. At CES, we announced a partnership with Samsung to integrate GeForce NOW in its smart TVs starting in Q2 of this year. This follows last month's beta release of GeForce NOW for LG smart TVs. In addition, we teamed up with AT&T to bring GeForce NOW to 5G mobile devices in the U.S. We also added our first GFN data center in Canada. Moving to pro visualization. Q4 revenue was $643 million, up 11% sequentially and up 109% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $2.1 billion was up 100%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a shift to higher-value workstation and the continued ramp of our NVIDIA healthcare architecture. We believe strong demand is fueled by continued build-outs for hybrid work environments as well as growth in key workloads, including 3D design, AI and rendering. For example, Sony Pictures ImageWorks is using NVIDIA RTX to accelerate ray-tracing for rendering-related applications. Motion is using NVIDIA RTX for AI to assist in predictive maintenance of the vehicles. Duke Energy is using NVIDIA RTX for AI and VR to map, view and maintain energy facilities. NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise software entered general availability. While it's still in early days, customer feedback so far has been very positive, with multiple significant enterprise licensees already signed. In addition to software licenses, Omniverse also drives computing opportunities for NVIDIA RTX in laptops, workstations, on-prem servers and the cloud. Omniverse can be used by individuals for free and by enterprise teams via software subscriptions. At CES, we made the free version of Omniverse for individuals available. Omniverse allows creators with RTX GPUs to connect leading 3D design applications to a single scheme and superset their work with AI and physics. We also announced early access to Omniverse Cloud, which adds one-click capability to collaborate with other artists, whether across the room or across the globe. For digital twin applications, we announced the Isaac Autonomous Mobile Robot platform using Omniverse and securely orchestrated and cloud delivered with the platform optimizes operational efficiency and accelerate deployment from logistics. It consists of several NVIDIA AI technologies and SDKs, including data for high-precision mapping and situational awareness for real-time route optimization. Moving to automotive. Q4 revenue was $125 million, declining 7% sequentially and 14% from the year-ago quarter. Fiscal year revenue of $566 million was up 6%. We have just started shipments of our Orion-based product platform and expect to return to sequential revenue growth in Q1 with more meaningful inflection in the second half of the fiscal year and momentum building into calendar 2023.

Data center growth in the quarter was once again led by our compute products on strong demand for NVIDIA AI. Hyperscale and cloud demand was outstanding, with revenue more than doubling year-on-year. Vertical Industries also posted strong double-digit year-on-year growth led by consumer Internet companies. The flagship NVIDIA A100 GPU continues to drive strong growth. Inference-focused revenue more than tripled year-on-year. Accelerating inference growth has been enabled by widespread adoption of our Triton and France server software, which helps customers deliver fast and scalable AI in production. Data center compute demand was driven by continued deployment of our Ampere architecture-based product for fast-growing AI workloads such as natural language processing and deep learning recommendation systems as well as cloud executing. For example, Block Inc., a global leader in payment, uses conversational AI in its Square Assistant to schedule appointments with customers. These AI models are trained on video GPUs in AWS and perform inference 10x faster on the AWS GP service than on our CPUs. Social media company Snap used NVIDIA GPUs and Merlin deep recommendator software to improve inference cost efficiency by 50% and decrease latency to 2x. For the third year in a row, industry benchmarks show that NVIDIA AI continues to lead the industry in performance. Along with partners like Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA set records in the latest benchmarks for AI training across 8 popular AI workloads, including computer vision, natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning and detection. NVIDIA AI was the only platform to make submissions across all benchmarks and use cases, demonstrating versatility as well as our performance. The numbers show performance gains on our A100 GPUs of over 5x in just 2 months, thanks to continuous innovations across the full stack in AI algorithms, optimization tools and system software. Over the past 3 years, they have seen performance gains of over 20x powered by advances we have made across our full stack offering GPUs, networks, systems and software. The top-notch performance of NVIDIA AI is in demand by some of the most technologically advanced companies globally. Meta Platforms recently introduced its new AI supercomputer research, SuperCluster, which utilizes over 6,000 A100 GPUs. Early benchmarks from Meta indicated that this system can train large natural language processing models three times faster and conduct computer vision tasks twenty times faster than the previous system. Later this year, in a second phase, the system will scale up to 16,000 GPUs, which Meta anticipates will achieve five times the mixed precision AI performance. Alongside high performance, Meta highlighted the system's extreme reliability, security, privacy, and flexibility to support a diverse array of AI models as crucial criteria for its selection. We continue to broaden the reach and ease the adoption of NVIDIA AI into vertical industries. Our ecosystem of NVIDIA-certified systems expanded with Cisco and Hitachi which joined Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Insper, Lenovo and Supermicro, among other server manufacturers. We released version 1.1 of our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, allowing enterprises to accelerate annual workloads on VMware, on mainstream IT infrastructure as well. And we expanded the number of system integrators qualified for NVIDIA AI Enterprise. Forrester Research in its evaluation of Enterprise AI infrastructure providers recognized NVIDIA in the top category of leaders. An example of a partner that's helping to expand our reach into enterprise IT is Deloitte, a leading global consulting firm, which has built its center for AI computing on NVIDIA DGX Superpod. At CES, we extended our collaboration to AV development, leveraging our own robust AI infrastructure and Deloitte's team of 5,500 system integration developers and 2,000 data scientists to architect solutions for truly intelligent transportation. Our networking products posted strong sequential and year-over-year growth, driven by exceptional demand across use cases ranging from computing, supercomputing and enterprise to storage. Adopters-led growth driven by adoption of our next-generation products and higher-speed deployments. While revenue was gated by supply, we anticipate improving capacity in coming quarters, which should allow us to serve the significant customer demands we're seeing. Across the board, we are excited about the traction we are seeing with our new software business models, including NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. We are still early in the software revenue ramp. Our pipelines are building as customers across the industry seek to accelerate their pace of adoption and innovation with NVIDIA.

When we entered into the transaction in September 2020, we believed that it would accelerate Arm's focus on high-performance CPUs and help Arm expand into new markets, benefiting all our customers in the entire ecosystem. Like any combination of pioneers of important technologies, our proposed acquisition spurred questions from regulators worldwide. We appreciated the regulatory concerns. For over a year, we worked closely with SoftBank and Arm to explain our vision for Arm and reassure regulators that NVIDIA would be a worthy steward of the Arm ecosystem. We gave it our best shot, but the headwinds were too strong, and we could not give regulators the comfort they needed to approve our deal. NVIDIA's work in accelerated computing and our overall strategy will continue as before. Our focus is accelerated computing. We are on track to launch our Arm-based CPU, targeting giant AI and HPC workloads in the first half of next year. Our 20-year architectural license to Arm's IP allows us the full breadth and flexibility of options across technologies and markets. We will deliver on our 3-chip strategy across CPUs, GPUs and DPUs. Whether x86 or Arm, we will use the best CPU for the job. And together with partners in the computer industry, we will offer the world's best computing platform to tackle the impactful challenges of our time. Back to you, Colette.",

For the discussion of the rest of the P&L, please refer to the CFO commentary published earlier today on our Investor Relations page. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect sequential growth to be driven primarily by Data Center. Gaming will also contribute to growth. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.2% and 67%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $3.55 billion, including the Arm write-off of $1.36 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.6 billion. For the fiscal year, we expect to grow non-GAAP operating expenses at a similar rate as in fiscal 2022. GAAP and non-GAAP other operating expenses are both expected to be an expense of approximately $55 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. Non-GAAP tax rate are expected to be 11% and 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in person on March 7. We will also be hosting a virtual Investor Day on March 22, alongside the GPU Technology Conference. This will follow Jensen's opening keynote, which we invite you to tune into. Our earnings call to discuss the results for our first quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 27. We will now open the call for questions.

We also have Arm projects with the CPU that you mentioned, Grace. We have Grace, and we surely have the follow-ons to Grace, and you could expect us to do a lot of CPU developments around the Arm architecture. One of the things that's really evolved nicely over the last couple of years is the success that Arm has seen in hyperscalers and data centers. It's really accelerated and motivated them to accelerate the development of higher-end CPUs. You\u2019re going to see a lot of exciting CPUs coming from us. Grace is just the first example. You're going to see a whole bunch of them beyond that. But our strategy is accelerated computing. That's ultimately what we do for a living. We, as you know, love it where there's any CPUs. If it's an x86 from any vendor. So long as we have a CPU, we could connect NVIDIA's platform to it and accelerate it for artificial intelligence or computer graphics, robotics and such. We love to see the expansion of CPU footprints, and we're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics and autonomous vehicles and cloud computing and supercomputing and in all these different applications, and we intend to bring the full spectrum of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform to NVIDIA Arm CPUs.",

It begins with identifying the types of applications we want to enhance and can enhance, and then constructing a complete system that includes processors, systems, system software, acceleration engines, and even applications like NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA AI, and NVIDIA Omniverse. These applications operate on top of system software and are highly valuable in the marketplace. Regarding our software licensing, we've always focused on software, but now we have licensed software available for customers for the first time. The licensing model for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is based on the number of server nodes. There are approximately 20 to 25 million servers currently installed in enterprises, not counting cloud services. We envision a future where every server will run AI software, and we aim to provide an engine that allows enterprises to utilize the most advanced and trusted AI engine available. This is the target market for NVIDIA AI. NVIDIA Omniverse aims to support creators who contribute content to a virtual world, integrating it with robots that also generate content in that environment. There are 40 million designers and creators around the world. There are going to be hundreds of millions of robots. Every single car will essentially be a robot someday. Those are connections that will be connected into a digital twin system like Omniverse. The Omniverse business model is per connection per year. In the case of NVIDIA DRIVE, we share the economics of the software that we deliver, whether it's AV software, parking software or cabin-based AI software. Whatever the licensing is or whatever the service, if it's an upfront license, we share the economics. If it's a monthly service subscription, we share the economics of that. For the cars that we are part of, that we are developing, the end-to-end service, we will get the benefits of the economics of that for the entire life of the fleet of the car. You could imagine, with 10 million cars, with modern car lifetimes of 10 to 20 years, the economics and the market, the installed opportunity is quite high. Our software business really started several years ago with virtual GPUs, but this year was when we really stepped it up and offered for the very first time NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Omniverse and DRIVE.

In cases of consumer pointing businesses, customer service, conversational AI, where people are calling chat bots. In the future, every website will have a chat bot; every phone number will have a chat bot, whether it's a human in the loop or not human in the loop, we'll have a chat bot. Customer service will be heavily supported by artificial intelligence in the future. Almost every point of sales, I think, whether it's in fast food or a quick-service business, will have chat bots and AI-based customer service. All of this is made possible by a couple of breakthroughs, computer vision, of course, because the agents, the AIs have to make eye contact and recognize your posture and such, recognize speech, understand the context and what is being spoken about and have a reasonable conversation with people so that you could provide good customer service. The ability to have human in the loop is one of the great things about AI, much more so than a recording, which is obviously not intelligent and therefore it's difficult to call your manager or call somebody to provide services that they can't. The number of different applications that have been enabled by natural language understanding in customer service in just the last couple of years has grown tremendously. I think we're still in the early days of our adoption. It's incredible how fast it has grown and how many different applications are now possible with AI. I think we remain in the early innings yet of AI, and this is going to be one of the largest industries of software that we have ever known. Regarding capital, we had just terminated our Arm agreement. We have a regular capital strategy process, and we'll go through that, and we'll make the best judgment about how to use our capital in helping our growth and sustaining our growth and accelerating our growth, and we'll have all of those sensible conversations during those capital allocation meetings.

It brought forward ray tracing about a decade earlier than anybody thought possible. The combination of RTX with artificial intelligence, which enabled this technology we call DLSS, is able to not only do a ton more computation using our processors but also engage the powerful Tensor processors that we have in our GPUs to generate beautiful images. RTX is being adopted by just every game developer on the planet now. It's being adopted by just about every design tool on the planet now. If not for RTX, Omniverse wouldn't be possible. We wouldn't be able to do physically based path tracing and simulate sensors like radars and LiDARs and ultrasonics and cameras, and simulate these cameras physically and still be able to deliver the type of performance that we do. RTX was a game changer for the industry. It reset modern computer graphics. It was an enabler for us to build an entire new platform from Omniverse. We're about, I think, about a third of the way through upgrading an installed base that is growing. Video games is now the world's largest gaming genre. Steam over the last 2 years has grown by 50%. The number of concurrent players on Steam has grown tremendously. In just the last couple of years, a brand-new game store from Epic came on, and it's already a multi-hundred million dollar business. I think it's close to $1 billion that they're doing incredibly well. I'm so happy to see it. The overall gaming market is growing, and it's growing quite nicely. But in addition to resetting computer graphics for our entire installed base, the growing of our installed base because gaming is growing, there are a couple of other growth dynamics that are associated with GeForce and RTX that's really quite brand new. One of them is hybrid work. This is a permanent condition. We now are seeing across the board people who are designers and creators now have to set up essentially a new workstation or new home workstation design studio so that they could do their work at home. In addition, the creative economy, the digital economy, the creative economy is doing fantastically because everything has to be done in 3D now. Print ads are done in 3D. So 2D print is done in 3D. Video is done in 3D. In live video broadcast, the millions of influencers now augment their broadcast with rich augmented reality and 3D graphics. 3D graphics is now not just for video games and 3D content; it's actually used for all forms of digital content creation.

If not for the work that we did so closely with Mellanox, the scalability of DGX and DGX Super Pine and the research supercomputer that was just installed in Meta would just not be possible. The concepts of overlapping networking and compute, moving some computing into the fabric, into the network, the work that we're doing with Synchronoss and Precision Timing so that we could create Omniverse computers that obey the laws of physics and space-time, these things are just simply not possible. The number of innovations, that are countless. I am so thrilled with the combination and the work the Mellanox team is doing. We've accelerated roadmaps as a result of the combination that we could leverage a much larger base of chip design. BlueField's roadmap has been accelerated probably by about a year. The quantum switch and the spectrum switch, the SerDes are absolutely world-class, shared between Ethernet and InfiniBand and NVLink, absolutely the best servers in the world. The list of opportunities or the list of combination benefits is really quite countless. I'm super thrilled with that. With respect to networking growth, we should be growing. If we weren't supply constrained, we should be growing faster than overall CSP growth. The reason for that is twofold. The first is because the networking leadership position of Mellanox, Mellanox is heavily weighted in the upper end of networking, where the adoption of higher-speed networks tends to move. It makes sense that as new data centers are built, the first preference is to install it with higher-speed networking than the last-generation networking. Mellanox's networking technology is unambiguously world-class. The second reason is because the areas where overall NVIDIA is strong has to do with the areas that are growing quite fast, which relate to artificial intelligence or cloud AI and such. Those different applications are growing faster than the core. So it would be sensible that we have the opportunity to continue to grow faster than CSPs overall.",

          "content": "Thank you, Matt. There are a few key bottlenecks that I want to emphasize. The first is memory speed, which is why we utilize the fastest types of memory available, such as HBM and GDDR. We are the largest users of high-speed memory globally, with no close competitor that I am aware of. Our significant use of fast memory is crucial for our operations. The second bottleneck is networking performance, which is why we implement the fastest networks. We have one of the most rapid networking systems, featuring eight InfiniBand connections at peak speeds directly linked to our HGX or DGX servers. Our work with GPU direct memory, RDMA, and GPU direct storage, along with in-network computing, data reductions, and data movement within the network, is truly top-notch. I take immense pride in this area. All of that is so we could be less bottlenecked by the CPU. Remember, inside our DGX system is one CPU and 8 GPUs. The fundamental goal is to offload as much as we can and utilize the resources that we have as much as we can. This year, we expect a transition from PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 5. We are constrained on Gen 4. We'll be constrained on Gen 5, but we're used to that, and that's something that we're very good at. We'll continue to support Gen 4 well through next year, maybe well through the next couple of years, and all of the installed base of Gen 4 systems that are going to be all over the world, so we will take advantage of Gen 5 as much as we can. We have all kinds of new technologies and strategies to improve the throughput of systems and avert the bottlenecks that are there.",

When you're contemplating your margin profile over the next couple of years, how do we think about that? Is it really going to be driven by an increasing mix of software as a percentage of your revenue over time? Is there more margin upside on the hardware side in terms of some of your segments? The software opportunity is very exciting, but I'm just curious how that would translate to your longer-term margin profile.",

I believe these sectors will continue to present growth opportunities, especially as we enhance our capabilities to package solutions for our Enterprise customers in the data center and with existing agreements. This presents a promising future for both gross and operating margins, and we are committed to pursuing this.

          "content": "Thanks, everyone. The tremendous demand for our computing platforms, NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA HPC and NVIDIA AI drove a great quarter, capping a record year. Our work propels advances in AI, digital biology, climate sciences, gaming, creative design to autonomous vehicles and robotics in some of today's most impactful fields. Our open computing platform optimized across the full stack architecture for data center scale is adopted by customers globally from cloud to core to edge and robotics. I am proud of the NVIDIA operations team as we make substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. This year, we introduced new software business models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA DRIVE. NVIDIA DRIVE is a full stack end-to-end platform that serves the industry with AV chips, data center infrastructure for AI and simulation, mapping and the autonomous driving application service. Our data center infrastructure is used by just about anybody building AVs, robotics, robot taxis, shuttles and trucks. EV companies have selected our Orin chip globally. Our partnerships with Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover have opened up a new software and services business model for millions of cars for the life of the fleet. NVIDIA Omniverse is a world simulation engine that connects simulated digital worlds to the physical world. Omniverse is a digital twin, a simulation of the physical world. The system can be a building, a factory, a warehouse, a car, a fleet of cars, a robotic factory orchestrating a fleet of robots building cars that are themselves robotic. Today's Internet is 2D and AI is in the cloud. The next phase of the Internet will be 3D, and AI will be connected to the physical world. We created Omniverse to enable the next wave of AI where AI and robotics touches our world. Omniverse can sound like science fiction, but there are real-world use cases today. Hundreds of companies are evaluating Omniverse. We can't wait to share more of our progress at next month's GTC, learn about new chips, new computing platforms, new AI and robotic breakthroughs and the new frontiers of Omniverse. Hear from the technologists of Deloitte, Epic Games, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Pfizer, Sony, Visa, Walt Disney, Zoom and more. This GTC promises to be our most exciting developers conference ever. We had quite a year, yet nothing makes me more proud than the incredible people who have made NVIDIA one of the best companies to work for and the company where they do their lives' work. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.",

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. We delivered a strong quarter driven by record revenue in both Data Center and Gaming, with strong fundamentals and execution against a challenging macro backdrop. Total revenue of $8.3 billion was a record, up 8% sequentially and up 46% year-on-year. Data Center has become our largest market platform, and we see continued strong momentum going forward. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $3.6 billion rose 6% sequentially and 31% year-on-year, powered by the GeForce RTX 30 Series product cycle. Since launching in the fall of 2020, the RTX 30 Series has been our best Gaming product cycle ever. The gaming industry has grown tremendously with 100 million new PC gamers added in the past two years according to Newzoo. And NVIDIA RTX has set a new standard for the industry with demand from both first-time GPU buyers as well as those upgrading their PCs to experience the 250-plus RTX-optimized games and apps, which have doubled from last year. We estimate that almost a third of the GeForce Gaming GPU installed base is now on RTX. RTX has brought tremendous energy into the gaming world and has helped drive a sustained expansion in our higher-end platforms and installed base with significant runway still ahead. Overall, end demand remained solid though mixed by region, and demand in the Americas remained strong. However, we started seeing softness in parts of Europe related to the war in Ukraine and parts of China due to the COVID lockdowns. As we expect some ongoing impact as we prepare for a new architectural transition later in the year, we are projecting Gaming revenue to decline sequentially in Q2. Channel inventory has nearly normalized, and we expect it to remain around these levels in Q2. The extent to which cryptocurrency mining contributed to Gaming demand is difficult for us to quantify with any reasonable degree of precision. The reduced pace of increase in Ethereum network hash rate likely reflects lower mining activity on GPUs. We expect a diminishing contribution going forward. Laptop Gaming revenue posted strong sequential and year-on-year growth, driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA RTX 30 Series lineup. With this year's spring refresh and ahead of the upcoming back-to-school season, there are now over 180 laptop models featuring RTX 30 Series GPUs and our energy-efficient thin and light Max-Q technologies, up from 140 at this time last year. Driving this growth are not just gamers, but also the fast-growing category of content creators for whom we offer dedicated NVIDIA studio drivers. We've also developed applications and tools to empower artists from Omniverse for advanced 3D collaboration to broadcast for live streaming to Canvas for painting landscapes with AI. The creator economy is estimated at $100 billion and powered by 80 million individual creators and broadcasters. We continued to build out our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. Gamers can now access RTX 3080 class streaming, our new top-tier offering with subscription plans of $19.99 a month. We added over 100 games to the GeForce NOW library, bringing the total to over 1,300 games. And last week, we launched Fortnite on GeForce NOW with touch controls for mobile devices, streaming through the Safari web browser on iOS and the GeForce NOW Android app. Moving to Pro Visualization, Q1 revenue was $622 million, down sequentially 3% and up 67% from a year ago. Demand remains strong as enterprises continued to build out their employees' remote office infrastructure to support hybrid work. Sequential growth in the mobile workstation GPUs was offset by lower desktop revenue. Strong year-on-year growth was supported by the NVIDIA RTX Ampere architecture product cycle. Top use cases include digital content creation at customers such as Sony Pictures Animation and medical imaging at customers such as Medtronic. In just its second quarter of general availability, our Omniverse enterprise software is being adopted by some of the world's largest companies. Amazon is using Omniverse to create digital twins to better optimize warehouse design and flow and to train more intelligent robots. Kroger is using Omniverse to optimize store efficiency with digital twin store simulation. And PepsiCo is using Omniverse digital twins to improve the efficiency and environmental sustainability of the supply chain. Omniverse is also expanding our GPU sales pipeline, driving higher end and multiple GPU configurations. The Omniverse ecosystem continues to rapidly expand with third-party developers in robotics, industrial automation, 3D design and rendering ecosystems developing connections to Omniverse. Moving to automotive, Q1 revenue of $138 million increased 10% sequentially and declined 10% from the year-ago quarter. Our DRIVE Orin SoC is now in production and kicks off a major product cycle with auto customers ramping in Q2 and beyond. Orin has great traction in the marketplace with over 35 customer wins from automakers, truck makers, and robotaxi companies. In Q1, BYD, China's largest EV maker and Lucid, an award-winning EV pioneer were the latest to announce that they are building their next-generation fleets on DRIVE Orin. Our automotive design win pipeline now exceeds $11 billion over the next six years, up from $8 billion just a year ago. Moving to Data Center, record revenue of $3.8 billion grew 15% sequentially and accelerated to 83% growth year-on-year. Revenue from hyperscale and cloud computing customers more than doubled year-on-year, driven by strong demand for both external and internal workloads. Customers remain supply-constrained in their infrastructure needs and continue to add capacity as they try to keep pace with demand. Revenue from vertical industries grew a strong double-digit percentage from last year. Top verticals driving growth this quarter include consumer Internet companies, financial services, and telecom. Overall, Data Center growth was driven primarily by strong adoption of our A100 GPU for both training and inference, with large volume deployments by hyperscale customers and broadening adoption across the vertical industries. Top workloads include recommender systems, conversational AI, large language models, and cloud graphics. Networking revenue accelerated on strong broad-based demand for our next-generation 25, 50, and 100-gig ethernet adapters. Customers are choosing NVIDIA's networking products for their leading performance and robust software functionality. In addition, networking revenue is benefiting from growing demand for DGX super pods and cross-selling opportunities. Customers are increasingly combining our compute and networking products to build essentially modern AI factories with data as the raw material input and intelligence as the output. Our networking products are still supply-constrained, though we expect continued improvement throughout the rest of the year. One of the biggest workloads driving adoption of NVIDIA AI is natural language processing, which has been revolutionized by transformer-based models. Recent industry breakthroughs traced to transformers include large language models like GPT-3, NVIDIA Megatron BERT for drug discovery, and DeepMind AlphaFold for protein structure prediction. Transformers allow self-supervised learning without the need for human-labeled data. They enable unprecedented levels of accuracy for tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, and answering questions. To do that, transformers use enormous training datasets and very large networks well into the hundreds of billions of parameters. To run these giant models without sacrificing low inference times, customers like Microsoft are increasingly deploying NVIDIA AI, including our NVIDIA Ampere architecture-based GPUs and full software stack. In addition, we are seeing a rising wave of customer innovation using large language models driven by increased demand for NVIDIA AI and GPU instances in the cloud. At GTC, we announced our next-generation Data Center GPU, the H100 based on the new Hopper architecture. Packed with 80 billion transistors, H100 is the world's largest, most powerful accelerator, offering an order of magnitude leap in performance over the A100. We believe H100 is hitting the market at the perfect time. H100 is ideal for advancing large language models and deep recommender systems, the two largest scale AI workloads today. We are working with leading server makers and hyperscale customers to qualify and ramp H100, as well as the new DGX H100 AI supercomputing system which will ramp in volume late in the calendar year. Building on the H100 product side, we are on track to launch our first-ever Data Center CPU, Grace, in the first half of 2023. Grace is the ideal CPU for AI factories. This week at COMPUTEX, we announced that dozens of server models based on Grace will be brought to market by the first wave of system builders, including ASUS, Foxconn, Gigabyte, QCT, Supermicro, and Wiwynn. These servers will be powered by the NVIDIA Grace CPU Super Chip, which features two CPUs and the Grace Hopper Super Chip, which pairs an NVIDIA Hopper GPU with an NVIDIA Grace CPU in an integrated model. We've introduced new reference designs based on Grace for the massive new workloads of next-generation data centers: CGX for cloud graphics and gaming, OVX for digital twins or Omniverse, and HGX for HPC and AI. These server designs are all optimized for NVIDIA's rich accelerated computing software stacks and can be qualified as part of our NVIDIA certified systems lineup. The enabler for the Grace Hopper and Grace Super Chips is our ultra-energy-efficient, low-latency, high-speed memory coherent interconnect NVLink, which scales from die to die, chip to chip, and system to system. With NVLink, we can configure Grace and Hopper to address a broad range of workloads. Future NVIDIA chips, including CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, NICs, and SoCs will integrate NVLink just like Grace Hopper, based on our world-class SERDES technology. We're making NVLink open to customers and partners to implement custom chips that connect to NVIDIA's platforms. In networking, we're kicking off a major product cycle with the introduction of Spectrum-4, the world's first 400-gigabit per second end-to-end Ethernet networking platform, including the Spectrum-4 Switch, ConnectX-7 SmartNIC, Bluefield-3 DPU, and the DOCA software. Built for AI and video, Spectrum 4 arrives as data centers are growing exponentially and demanding extreme performance, advanced security, and powerful features to enable high-performance advanced virtualization and simulation at scale. Across our businesses, we are launching multiple new GPU, CPU, DPU, and SOC quarters over the coming quarters, with a ramp in supply to support customer demand. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 65.5% and non-GAAP gross margin was up 67.1%, up 90 basis points from a year ago, and up 10 basis points sequentially. We have been able to offset rising costs and supply chain pressures. We expect to maintain gross margins at current levels in Q2. Going forward, as new products ramp and software becomes a larger percentage of revenue, we have opportunities to increase gross margins longer term. GAAP operating margin was 22.5%, impacted by a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the ARM transaction. Non-GAAP operating margin was 47.7%. We are closely managing our operating expenses to balance the current macro environment with our growth opportunities, and we've been very successful in hiring so far this year and are now slowing to integrate these new employees. This also enables us to focus our budget on taking care of our existing employees as inflation persists. We are still on track to grow our non-GAAP operating expenses in the high 20s range this year. We expect sequential increases to level off after Q2 as the first half of the year includes a significant amount of expenses related to the bring-up of multiple new products, which should not reoccur in the second half. During Q1, we repurchased $2 billion of our stock. Our Board of Directors increased and extended our share repurchase program to repurchase an additional common stock up to a total of $15 billion through December 2023. Let me now turn to the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Our outlook assumes an estimated impact of approximately $500 million relating to Russia and China COVID lockdowns. We estimate the impact of lower sell-through in Russia and China to affect our Q2 Gaming sell-in by $400 million. Furthermore, we estimate the absence of sales to Russia to have a $100 million impact on Q2 in Data Center. We expect strong sequential growth in Data Center and Automotive to be more than offset by the sequential decline in Gaming. Revenue is expected to be $8.1 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 65.1% and 67.1%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $2.46 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $1.75 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 12.5% plus or minus 1%, excluding discrete items. And capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $400 million to $450 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight the upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the BofA Securities Technology Conference in person on June 7, where Jensen will participate in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 24.",

The underlying dynamics of the Gaming industry are really solid, net of the situation with COVID lockdown in China and Russia. The rest of the market is fairly robust, and we expect the Gaming dynamics to be intact. There are several things that are driving the Gaming industry. In the last two years alone, 100 million new gamers came into the PC industry. The format has expanded tremendously. And the ways that people are using their PCs to connect with friends, to be an influencer, as a platform for themselves, using it for broadcasts. So, many people are now using their home PCs as their second workstation, if you will, second studio, because they're also working from home. It is our primary way of communicating these days. The need for GeForce PCs has never been greater. And so I think the fundamental dynamics are really good. While it\u2019s hard to predict exactly when COVID and the war in Russia will be behind us, the governing dynamics of the Gaming industry remains great.",

I wanted to ask a longer-term question. Do you envision the business continuing to be sort of card-driven attached to third-party servers, or do you think revenue shifts dramatically, or in a small way, over time, to be more sort of vertically integrated, with all of the chips together on NVLink? And how is the industry responding to that potential move? Thanks.",

The next generation of servers currently being prepared are all Gen 5, which offer much higher I/O performance than previous versions. You can expect a substantial refresh as new networking cards from our company and others become available. Gen 5 naturally encourages new platform updates, and we are well-positioned to ramp up with the Gen 5 generation using Hopper. There are various system configurations to consider. If you take a step back and examine the systems necessary for data processing, scientific computing, machine learning, and training inference in the cloud for hyperscale, on-prem for enterprise computing, and at the edge, you'll find that each workload and deployment location requires a different system architecture. There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all solution, which is why it\u2019s excellent that we support PCI Express. We pioneered chip-to-chip interconnect technology about seven years ago, ahead of anyone else. Now in our fourth generation of NVLink, we can connect two chips next to each other, two dies, or two modules across multiple systems. Our coherent chip-to-chip link, NVLink, allows us to efficiently mix and match chips. I believe we will see more configurations develop over time. Our capability to support every workload through a universal accelerator\u2014which handles everything from data processing to data analytics to high-performance computing\u2014has enabled us to meet all these market segments.

Regarding software, there are all kinds of machine learning models, computer vision, speech AI, natural language understanding, and robotics applications. One visible example is self-driving cars, but recently, we've seen exciting breakthroughs with transformer models in natural language understanding and beyond.

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. This was a challenging quarter. Total revenue of $6.7 billion was down 19% sequentially and up 3% year-on-year, below the $8.1 billion outlook we provided on our last earnings call. As we indicated in our pre-announcement press release on August 8, we experienced a shortfall to our expectations driven primarily by weaker Gaming revenue. Today, we will share with you more details on our Q2 results and Q3 outlook. Starting with Gaming. Revenue of $2.04 billion was down 44% sequentially and down 33% year-on-year, reflecting challenging market conditions. As discussed in May, we expected a sequential decline in Gaming revenue due to softness in Europe related to the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China. The decline in Gaming GPU revenue was sharper than anticipated, driven by both lower units and lower ASPs. Macroeconomic headwinds across the world drove a sudden slowdown in consumer demand. We implemented programs with our Gaming channel partners to adjust pricing in the channel and to price position current high-end desktop GPUs as we prepare for a new architecture launch. As noted last quarter, we expected cryptocurrency mining to make a diminishing contribution to gaming demand. We are unable to accurately quantify the extent to which reduced crypto mining contributed to the decline in gaming demand. While Gaming navigates significant short-term macroeconomic challenges, we believe the long-term fundamentals in Gaming remain strong. NVIDIA RTX has redefined computer graphics and is now supported by almost 300 games and applications. NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce GPUs are the most coveted brand by gamers, representing 15 of the top 15 most popular GPUs on Steam. Gaming has emerged from the pandemic as an even more popular form of entertainment and social connectivity. Estimated GeForce sell-through is up over 70% since before the pandemic, and peak concurrent users on Steam are also up more than 70% over the same time period. GeForce NOW registered members now exceed 20 million. This quarter, we added 80 more titles, including the hugely popular Genshin Impact, bringing our total to over 1,350. Moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $496 million was down 20% sequentially and down 4% from a year ago. A sequential increase in mobile revenue was more than offset by lower desktop revenue, particularly at the high end. As macroeconomic headwinds intensified, enterprise demand slowed and OEMs worked to reduce inventory. We expect these trends to persist in Q3. While ProViz is undergoing a near-term adjustment after doubling last year, we believe we have expanded the market opportunity over the last couple of years with AI and Omniverse workloads. We believe hybrid work is here to stay, and with it, the need for collaborative 3D design enabled by professional graphic workstations, both at home and in the office as well as in the cloud. In June, we announced a partnership with Siemens to enable the industrial levers and AI-powered digital twins, connecting Siemens Xcelerator platform to NVIDIA Omniverse. This connection opens Siemens to the vast ecosystem of NVIDIA Omniverse and NVIDIA to Siemens' ecosystem of the world\u2019s largest industries. Earlier this month at SIGGRAPH, the premier computer graphics conference, we announced advancements to several foundational technologies of the metaverse, defined as the 3D version of the Internet. First, NVIDIA Omniverse Avatar Cloud Engine will enable businesses to create and deploy assistants and avatars, transforming interactions across a range of industries. We also unveiled 11 new Omniverse connectors, bringing the total number of connectors to the Omniverse USD ecosystem to 112. And finally, we released SDKs for the new field of neural graphics, which intertwine AI and graphics to help automate the creation of virtual worlds. Moving to Automotive. Revenue of $220 million increased 59% sequentially and 45% from the year-ago quarter. Strong growth was driven by auto AI solutions, which include AI cockpit and self-driving revenue, with particular strength in self-driving as new energy vehicle design wins ramp into volume. We believe Q2 was an inflection point for our automotive revenue as NVIDIA Orin has great momentum. During the quarter, we announced rollout plans of new vehicles from OEM partners, NIO, Li Auto, JIDU, and Human Horizons as well as Pony.ai\u2019s line of self-driving trucks and robotaxis, all built on NVIDIA DRIVE. Looking forward, we expect our $11 billion automotive design win pipeline to translate to continued growth. Moving to Data Center. Revenue of $3.81 billion grew 1% sequentially and 61% year-on-year. Although a record, this was somewhat short of our expectations as we were impacted by supply chain disruptions. Revenue from hyperscale customers nearly doubled year-on-year. Sequentially, sales to North America hyperscale and cloud computing customers increased but were more than offset by lower sales to China hyperscale customers affected by domestic economic conditions. Vertical industries grew both sequentially and year-on-year. Key workloads driving growth include natural language processing, recommender systems, autonomous vehicle fleet, data processing and training, and cloud graphics. Let me share a couple of customer examples. Pinterest transitioned to 100 times larger recommender models by moving its inference from CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs. Its ability to deploy a higher-quality model at high throughput and low latency resulted in a 16% increase in engagement, a critical metric for the company, which has over 400 million users and 300 billion images. And Tesla recently upgraded its supercomputer to use over 7,000 A100 GPUs for autopilot training. From a product perspective, networking led growth this quarter with strong demand from our high-speed Ethernet adapters and design win momentum toward next-generation adapters, including the ConnectX-6 and ConnectX-7. We also see growing interest from cloud service providers for our new Spectrum-4 400-gigabit-per-second Ethernet networking platform. Additionally, we are ramping into the upcoming launches of our next-generation platforms. The Hopper architecture flagship H100 data center GPU is in production. Grace is our first CPU. Top computer makers, including Dell, HPE, Inspur, Lenovo, and Supermicro are adopting the new NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip and Grace Hopper Superchip to build the next generation of supercomputers. 72% of the systems on the latest top 500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA, including 31 of 39 new systems. NVIDIA\u2019s Selene supercomputer ranks at number 8 in the top 500 and is the world\u2019s fastest enterprise supercomputer. Moreover, 22 of the top 30 systems on the Green 500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA. Significant advances in software technologies are key to our platform performance. In the past two years, our A100-based platform has delivered 6 times more performance as measured by the MLPerf industry benchmark, largely through new software technologies and optimizations. Last month, we announced an update to the NeMo Megatron framework that can speed up the training of large language models by up to 30%, improving a multi-hundred million dollar AI infrastructure by 30% translates to significant value for customers. LLM are one of the most important neural networks today, ranging in size from tens of billions to over 1 trillion parameters. Learning from text, they can be used for real-time content generation, text summarization, customer service chatbots, and question answering for conversational AI interfaces. Currently, these capabilities are available to early access customers to run on NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD and NVIDIA DGX Foundry as well as in Microsoft Azure cloud with other platforms available soon. We are working with the industry leaders in large language models, a very active and exciting space of AI. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 43.5%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 45.9%. Gross margin includes $1.22 billion in charges for inventory and related reserves based on revised expectations of future demand and $122 million for warranty reserves. These charges incurred in the quarter reflect purchase commitments that we made during the time of severe component shortages and our current expectation of ongoing macro uncertainty. We believe our long-term gross margin profile is intact. GAAP operating expenses were up 36% from a year ago and down 32% sequentially as Q1 included a $1.35 billion acquisition termination charge related to the Arm transaction. Non-GAAP operating expenses were up 38% from a year ago and up 9% sequentially. These increases were driven primarily by employee growth costs, as well as increases in salaries to support our employees during this high inflationary environment and engineering development of new products coming to market. We have slowed operating expense growth, balancing investments for long-term revenue growth while managing near-term profitability. Our full year non-GAAP OpEx is expected to grow over 30%. During the first half of fiscal 2023, we returned $5.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. We plan to continue share repurchases. We have nearly $12 billion remaining under our authorization through December of 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal \u201823. We expect Gaming and ProViz revenue to decline sequentially as OEMs and channel partners reduce inventory levels to align with current levels of demand and prepare for our new product generation. We expect that decline to be partially offset by sequential growth in data center and automotive. Revenue is expected to be $5.9 billion plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 62.4% and 65%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.59 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.82 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an expense of approximately $10 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $550 million to $600 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Jefferies Conference in Chicago on August 30th and the Goldman Sachs Conference in San Francisco on September 12th. And we will be holding a financial analyst Q&A with management following Jensen\u2019s GTC keynote on September 20th. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 16th. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, can you assist?

Across those two quarters, the Q2 of \u201823, the Q3 of \u201823, we have likely undershipped gaming to our end demand significantly. We expect that sell-through or essentially our end demand for those combined two quarters of Q2 and Q3 to be approximately $5 billion. Now, on top of this, keep in mind that we do have gaming growth drivers to consider for the future. These can include our new gaming product introductions that are around the corner as well as new segments of the market that we plan to reach with our gaming technology to just name a couple. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jensen to talk a little bit more about that. Now, regarding any further types of write-downs on this perspective, we did a thorough assessment with this quarter, not only just looking at what we needed for this quarter but what we need for the long term. Keep in mind, our inventory provisions and write-downs that we took into account had to reflect some of the purchasing that we did a supply back more than a year ago when we were still in extreme supply shortages in almost all of our products. And so, this was an opportunity for us to resize given the macroeconomic conditions, what we needed in terms of supply. So, our expectations were higher, and we took this opportunity to write them down to what our current expectations are. I\u2019ll turn it over to Jensen to see if he wants to add more.",

In fact, sell-through has grown by 70% since before COVID-19. It is evident that the fundamentals of gaming are robust, and this medium is thriving. Additionally, our gaming PCs are being utilized by influencers, content creators, V-loggers, VTubers, and many others in various innovative ways to engage with video games. Our strategy is to reduce sell-in this quarter and next quarter to allow channel inventory to correct. We have moved away from the highs, and the macro conditions have worsened significantly. Therefore, our primary approach is to decrease sell-in over the next couple of quarters to fix channel inventory. Additionally, we have implemented programs to price position our current products in anticipation of next-generation products. Ampere is the most popular GPU we have ever developed, ranking among the top 15 gaming GPUs on Steam. It remains one of the best GPUs globally and is expected to continue being successful for a while. However, we also have exciting new next-generation products on the way, which will complement the existing ones. To summarize, we are reducing sell-in to correct channel inventory and have established programs with our partners to price position products in the channel in readiness for the next generation.

So just wanted to make sure our baseline assumption is set there. And then, my question is actually similar on the data center. Sales are pretty strong right now, but there is a concern that data center CapEx could be the next shoe to drop in this rolling correction in semiconductors. I\u2019m curious, what\u2019s your sense of utilization of your data center shipments?

          "content": "Thanks, Vivek. The sell-through of GeForce is solid. The demand in the gaming market is robust, although it has decreased from the high levels we saw at the start of the year. Because we were preparing for such a strong market, we now have excess inventory. Our strategy is to sell at prices significantly below current sell-through levels in the marketplace to allow the channel to adjust. We plan to do this for a couple of quarters. We are confident that by the end of the year, we will be in a good position for the following year. The key point is that our sell-in rate is much lower than the current market sell-through. The sell-through has been solid, increasing 70% since before COVID, indicating that the gaming market remains very vibrant. On the second question regarding data center end markets, we have heard that there is a general shortage of GPU supply in the cloud. Demand for GPU rentals significantly surpasses the current supply. This makes sense to us, especially since the number of applications for GPUs in the cloud has increased substantially. For instance, in managing and collecting data from the autonomous vehicle fleet and utilizing that data to train AI models or to create high-definition maps, the cloud's use of GPUs for this specific application has risen significantly. Additionally, deep learning-based recommender systems have shown remarkable effectiveness, aiding internet service providers in improving user engagement and increasing click-through rates. This type of recommender system is expected to drive a considerable amount of data processing and machine learning in the cloud. Over the last several years, a significant model known as transformers has emerged, which we have discussed multiple times. This transformer model, particularly when scaled up, demonstrates impressive and effective capabilities for learning skills with few or no examples. It can perform tasks that it has not been specifically trained for because it encodes knowledge from vast amounts of data. This large language model innovation is utilized in areas such as conversational chat, Q&A summarization, text and image generation. Notably, it is also applied in the life sciences to comprehend chemistry. Our work in this field, named MegaMolBART, focuses on understanding proteins and DNA to interpret these extensive spatial and temporal data types. The significance of this area is substantial, and it is essential to pay attention to large language models.

So if you could talk a little bit more about those dynamics and just clarify for us that the October sequentially up data center guidance is actually clean of any pull-ins. And Jensen, the second part, the moving pieces, networking stronger in data center, U.S. hyperscale stronger, China hyperscale weaker.

Our supply chain during the quarter really was quite difficult, was quite challenging to work through. Our platforms, including HDX, networking chips, cables, switches, were very important to the customers. It\u2019s not just about us selling the GPUs. So even though customers order components themselves, they\u2019re looking from us what we may refer to as kits, kits that go with those GPUs for them to stand up their data centers. We also experienced supply disruptions internally with our logistics and our component availability. Some of our supply arrived very late in the quarter. We had very little time from a logistics and availability to get those things out. Customers were impacted as well by the availability of key third-party other components that we weren\u2019t offering, which were slowing down some of their deployments. So what we did in our Q2 orders that couldn\u2019t be delivered in Q3, given that some of these supply constraints existed, and we had Q3 demand where we did have supply in Q2.

This year, Chinese hyperscalers and internet companies significantly reduced their infrastructure investments, particularly starting in Q2. This slowdown cannot persist indefinitely. The growth of new technologies in software, the increasing number of cloud users, and the expansion of cloud services indicate ongoing investment potential. I fully anticipate that investment will rebound. The North American market is critical for us and has shown substantial revenue growth year-over-year among North American hyperscalers, which contrasts with the declines seen in China and highlights the slowdown there. However, I believe this situation won't last forever and expect a recovery. With respect to Hopper, we\u2019re in full production now. And we\u2019re racing to get Hopper 2; all of the CSPs are dying to get them.

Remember, we had purchased this very early on in the year as we needed to, to drive the commitment of the supply that we already have. And so what is happening here for the data center, we had great, high expectations. We still have very strong solid growth projection for data center as well. We\u2019re going to take this opportunity from some of the prior architecture pieces to write down those given what we see as just a change in terms of our expectations going forward. So you are correct. There are also pieces in there for gaming.

As for our AI business, there isn't really an established installed base. These are entirely new solutions that businesses are adopting. The productivity and cost-saving advantages of using autonomous systems are substantial. The demand is there; everyone wants to be more productive, save money, and work faster.

This increase is due to their enhanced utility, as they now serve as primary entertainment devices used over extended periods. GeForce acts like a console within your PC, and we have always believed that its average selling price should align with that of a game console, which should be approximately $500 at this point. Additionally, GeForce is available in the cloud, where it supports multiple gamers simultaneously, necessitating a more powerful version. Therefore, our cloud gaming graphics are generally higher-end. Moreover, many designers and creators are utilizing GeForce, using their PCs to produce content that often integrates with video games or leverage games for their artistic projects. Thus, for them, GeForce serves not just as a gaming tool but also as a creative workstation. Several factors are driving the increase in the average selling price of GeForce, and we have observed this trend developing over the past few years. Thanks, everyone.

NVIDIA\u2019s leadership in full-stack data center scale, accelerated computing has made us the ideal partner for companies racing to leverage the power of AI. Even with the current macroeconomic headwinds, demand for our data center products has never been stronger. The next wave of computing is coming. With AI and 3D graphics advances, developers will extend the Internet with virtual world overlays that connect to the physical world. This next evolution of the Internet is called the metaverse. We created Omniverse to connect the digital and physical world and be an open platform for creating and operating metaverse applications. The immediate applications for Omniverse span product design, manufacturing, and operations. Omniverse is off to a great start. Our automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next $1 billion business. Autonomous driving is one of the biggest challenges AI can solve, and computing opportunity for us spans the data center to the car. Autonomous driving will transform the auto industry into a tech industry. Automotive is one of the first to transform into a software-defined tech industry that all industries will be. We\u2019re building NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse to be the engines for the world\u2019s enterprise to become software-defined, AI-powered technology companies. I look forward to next month\u2019s GTC conference, where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics and gaming. AI\u2019s continuing breakthroughs and building the metaverse, the next evolution of the internet. So join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.",

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year on year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions. Starting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year on year. This reflects solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges, new export controls, and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S. cloud providers and a broadening set of consumer Internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems, and generative AI. As the number and scale of public cloud computing and Internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows, our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations, and analytics. During the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H-100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China. That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter. We started shipping our flagship H-100 data center GPU based on the new hopper architecture in Q3. A100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo, and SuperMicro. Early next year, the first H-100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. A100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks. H-100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance. It offers three times lower total cost of ownership while using five times fewer server nodes and 3.5 times less energy. Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy, and scale AI, including large state-of-the-art models. Microsoft Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens of thousands of A100 and H-100 GPUs, Quantum 2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking, and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform. Oracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. This includes bringing to Oracle Cloud infrastructure the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H-100. Cloud-based high-performance computing is seeing new scale as adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities' rising demand for AI in the cloud. NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries. Networking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints. Our new Quantum 240 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum. We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware, whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs. Our joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure software partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, and Red Hat. The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing '22 has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green 500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing. The number one most energy-efficient system is the Flat Iron Institute Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H-100 GPUs. At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVS, reference designs featuring the new L4 GPU based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual worlds using NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise. NVIDIA OBX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo, and SuperMicro by early 2023. Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVS systems. We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and Bio Nemo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, text summarization, chatbots, co-development, protein structure, and biomolecular property predictions. Moving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4. Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA, but softer in Asia Pacific as macroeconomic conditions and COVID lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand. Our new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first Ada GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090, became available in mid-October and received tremendous positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the Ada family, RTX 4080, is available today. The RTX 40 Series GPUs feature DLSS 3, the neural rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster gameplay. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and helped supercharge gaming. For example, the 15-year-old classic game Portal has now been reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 and has made it onto Steam's top 100 most wish-listed games. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350. There is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on Steam just hit a record of 30 million, surpassing the prior peak of 28 million in January. Activision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales, topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters Top Gun: Maverick and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness. Moreover, this month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out within minutes, with 18,000 esports fans packed into the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400. We also launched GeForce NOW on new gaming devices, including Logitech's Cloud handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks, and Razor 5G Edge. Moving to Pro Visualization, revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4. Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI simulation, computationally intensive design, and engineering workloads. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers, and enterprise teams to design, publish, and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device. Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OBX for graphics and physics simulation, NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads, and the NVIDIA graphics delivery network, a global scale, distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge. Leaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse. Home improvement retailer Lowe's is using it to help design, build, and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications and advanced analytics company heavy AI are creating Omniverse-powered digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network. Deutsche Bahn, operator of the German National Railway, is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability. Moving to automotive, revenue of $251 million increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by increased AI automotive solutions as our customers ramp up production. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to becoming our next multibillion-dollar platform. Global Cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA Drive platform. This is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both Drive Orin and DRIVEXaviar, along with 30 sensors. Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include Ton, Auto, NIO, Polestar, and others. At GTC, we also announced that the NVIDIA Drive Super Chip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC roadmap, delivers up to 2,000 teraflops of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace, Hopper, and Ada architectures. It is capable of running both the automated driving and in-vehicle infotainment systems simultaneously, offering high performance while reducing costs and energy consumption. Drive will be available for automakers' 25 models, with Geely-owned automaker Zika as the first announced customer. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin was 53.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%. Gross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases, and higher data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters. We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 23. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the A100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth, with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction. And in automotive, we expect continued ramp in our Orin design wins. All in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming, and data center. Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 63.2% and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Credit Suisse conference in Phoenix on November 30, the Rate Virtual Tech Conference on December 5, and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5 in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 22. We will now open the call for questions.",

Colette, just wanted to clarify first, I think last quarter you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter. I think you said China is somewhat weaker. So I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming. And then, Jen-Hsun, the question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. So if, let's say, U.S. cloud capex is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why?",

We had indicated that if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business. Now, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 was relatively solid. We've indicated that although China lockdowns continue to challenge our overall China business, it was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid, while desktop was a bit softer, particularly in the China and Asia areas. We expect though stronger end demand as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays, as well as the continuation of the Ada adoption.",

          "content": "Vivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics. The first has to do with general-purpose computing no longer scaling. Therefore, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency, scale, and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is generally recognized as the path forward as general-purpose computing slows. The second dynamic is AI. We are seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs with important breakthroughs in AI. One is called deep recommender systems, which is now quite essential to the best content, item, or product recommendation for someone using a device like a selfie camera or interacting with a computer using only voice. You need to really understand the nature and context of the person making the request to make the appropriate recommendation. The second has to do with large language models. This started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to BERT, which led to GPT-3, and now a whole range of models associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language, or even the languages of biology, chemistry, etc. Recently, I just saw a breakthrough called Jeans LM, which is one of the first examples of learning the language of human genomes. The third is generative AI. For the first ten years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI, but the ultimate goal of AI is to create something and contribute; to generate products. This is now the beginning of the era of generative AI. We see it everywhere, whether it's generating images, videos, or text of all kinds, it enhances our performance to improve productivity and reduce costs with whatever we have to work with. Productivity is more crucial than ever. Our company is indexed to both power efficiency and cost efficiency, and both are becoming more important.",

You know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem, and over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and startups of all kinds. But now more than ever, we are at the tipping point of clouds, which is fantastic. Because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly. This quarter, we announced several initiatives and partnerships, including one with Microsoft, which has everything to do with scaling up AI. We have many startups clamoring for large installations of our GPU to facilitate language model training and scaling AI efforts in enterprises, as well as amongst the world's Internet service providers. Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and scale, flexibility of clouds. Over the last year, we've been focusing on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud. Today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack for a significant part of what we're doing together, so that we can take a full stack out to the world's enterprises. This encompasses all software as well. A month ago, we announced a similar partnership with Oracle. You also saw that Rescale, a leader in high-performance cloud computing, has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. NVIDIA has also been integrated into Google Cloud Platform. We've recently announced Nemo, and Bio Nemo large language model services, putting NVIDIA software in the cloud, and we've also made Omniverse available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform and software stack offboarding to the cloud, allowing customers to engage with our software much more quickly. Customers can access our software on a per-GPU instance hour basis in the cloud or on-prem through software licensing. In both cases, our software is practically available everywhere, and our partners are excited because NVIDIA's rich ecosystem is global, which brings new consumption into their clouds and connects new opportunities to the APIs and services they offer.

And you also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers. So if you can clarify what was in those charges.

When we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down. Now, looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market. Our Ada architecture, our Hopper architecture, and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market, and as such, we are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for our expected demand going forward.

I ask this because you now have the A800, which is a modified version of the A100 with a lower data transfer rate. One could assume that customers might be accumulating that while they can still obtain it. The second part of my question is regarding the inventory charge. Could you elaborate on that? Last quarter, it was understandable that you took a charge due to revenue being lower than anticipated, but this time revenue came in almost as expected, and it seemed like China was neutral overall. Is the charge connected to just reducing A100 inventory more quickly? Is that what the charges are related to?",

Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that. They're usually very specific products and projects that we see. So I'm going to answer no\u2014nothing that we can see. Your second question regarding the inventory provisions. At the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China. We've always been looking at our needs long term. It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand. So that's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. So now looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns and continued economic challenges in China, it was time for us to take a hard look at what we think we'll need for the data center going forward and not lag for write-downs.",

But our pro visualization business we think will be flattish and likely not growing as we're still working on correcting the channel inventory levels to get to the right amount.

We don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All our network solutions are very high-end, designed for data centers that move a lot of data. In today's hyperscale data centers, deploying a large number of AI applications is likely to mean that the network bandwidth provisioned has substantial implications for overall throughput. The small incremental investment made in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars in savings through efficiently provisioning the service or billions of dollars more in throughput, which increases their economics. These days, with disaggregated AI applications provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is quite essential. It pays for itself almost immediately. You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world, powered completely by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network. That network pays for itself instantaneously because an investment into the infrastructure is significant and if you are slowed down by slow networks, the overall infrastructure efficiency is greatly reduced. Our focus on networking remains crucial. You might recall that NVIDIA's acquisition of Mellanox was at the time doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, and now we are approaching those numbers in a single quarter.",

When we work on large language models and recommender systems, the processing is distributed across the entire data center. We distribute workloads across multiple GPUs and nodes, needing them to run for extended periods. Thus, the importance of the network cannot be overstated. A mere 10% improvement in overall efficiency, while challenging, makes a significant difference. Using NVIDIA's InfiniBand along with our entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, we can do computation in the network itself. A lot of software runs in the network, not just data transfer. We call it in-network computing, meaning a great deal of software runs at the edge of the network. We achieve considerable differences in overall efficiency.

And again, you said it grew quarter-over-quarter. So is that a fair assumption? And then, I had a clarification on the USG band.

We are now at a tipping point for cloud computing, where nearly every enterprise worldwide is adopting both cloud-first and multi-cloud strategies. This explains why all the announcements we made over this quarter and during GTC showcase new platforms now available in the cloud. A CSP, or hyperscaler, can function as both a customer and a partner on the public cloud side of their business. Given the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem, we continue to have a strong relationship with our cloud service providers.

Therefore, this can impact their purchasing decisions as they still seek certain parts of the supply chain to come through. I hope this clarifies what we were discussing regarding two areas of supply. On stock-based compensation, it remains difficult to predict as it can vary based on the influx of incoming employees and once-a-year offerings to our employees, which are fixed.

          "content": "Thank you, Simona. Q4 revenue was $6.05 billion, up 2% sequentially, while down 21% year-on-year. Full-year revenue was $27 billion, flat from the prior year. Starting with data center, revenue of $3.62 billion was down 6% sequentially and up 11% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue was $15 billion and up 41%. Hyperscale customer revenue posted strong sequential growth, though short of our expectations as some cloud service providers paused at the end of the year to recalibrate their build plans. Though we generally see tightening that reflects overall macroeconomic uncertainty, we believe this is a timing issue as the end market demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure is strong. Networking grew but a bit less than we expected due to softer demand for general purpose CPU infrastructure. The total data center sequential revenue decline was driven by lower sales in China, which was largely in line with our expectations, reflecting COVID and other domestic issues. With cloud adoption continuing to grow, we are serving an expanding list of fast-growing cloud service providers, including Oracle and GPU specialized CSPs. Revenue growth from CSP customers last year significantly outpaced that of Data Center as a whole as more enterprise customers moved to a cloud-first approach. On a trailing 4-quarter basis, CSP customers drove about 40% of our Data Center revenue. Adoption of our new flagship H100 data center GPU is strong. In just the second quarter of its ramp, H100 revenue was already much higher than that of A100, which declined sequentially. This is a testament to the exceptional performance of the H100, which is as much as 9x faster than the A100 for training and up 30x faster than the inferencing of transformer-based large language models. The transformer engine of H100 arrived just in time to serve the development and scale-out of inference of large language models. AI adoption is at an inflection point. OpenAI's ChatGPT has captured interest worldwide, allowing people to experience AI firsthand and showing what's possible with generative AI. These new types of neural network models can improve productivity in a wide range of tasks, whether generating text like marketing copy, summarizing documents, creating images for ads or video games or answering customer questions. Generative AI applications will help almost every industry do more faster. Generative large language models with over 100 billion parameters are the most advanced neural networks in today's world. NVIDIA's expertise spans across AI supercomputers, algorithms, data processing, and training methods that can bring these capabilities to enterprises. We look forward to helping customers with generative AI opportunities. In addition to working with every major hyperscale cloud provider, we are engaged with many consumer Internet companies, enterprises, and start-ups. The opportunity is significant and driving strong growth in the data center that will accelerate through the year. During the quarter, we made notable announcements in the financial services sector, one of our largest industry verticals. We announced a partnership with Deutsche Bank to accelerate the use of AI and machine learning in financial services. Together, we are developing a range of applications, including virtual customer service agents, speech AI, fraud detection, and bank process automation, leveraging NVIDIA's full computing stack, both on-premise and in the cloud, including NVIDIA AI enterprise software. We also announced that NVIDIA captured leading results for AI inference in a key financial services industry benchmark for applications such as asset price discovery. In networking, we see growing demand for our latest generation InfiniBand and HPC optimized Ethernet platforms fueled by AI. Generative AI foundation model sizes continue to grow at exponential rates, driving the need for high-performance networking to scale out multi-node accelerated workloads. Delivering unmatched performance, latency, and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand is the clear choice for power-efficient cloud scale generative AI. For smaller scale deployments, NVIDIA is bringing its full accelerated stack expertise and integrating it with the world's most advanced high-performance Ethernet fabrics. In the quarter, InfiniBand led our growth as our Quantum 2 40-gigabit per second platform is off to a great start, driven by demand across cloud, enterprise, and supercomputing customers. In Ethernet, our 40-gigabit per second Spectrum 4 networking platform is gaining momentum as customers transition to higher speeds, next-generation adapters, and switches. We remain focused on expanding our software and services. We released version 3.0 of NVIDIA AI enterprise with support for more than 50 NVIDIA AI frameworks and pretrained models and new workflows for contact center intelligent virtual assistance, audio transcription, and cybersecurity.

          "content": "Thanks, Jensen. Gaming revenue of $1.83 billion was up 16% sequentially and down 46% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $9.07 billion is down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by the strong reception of our 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs based on the Ada Lovelace architecture. The year-on-year decline reflects the impact of channel inventory correction, which is largely behind us. And demand in the seasonally strong fourth quarter was solid in most regions. While China was somewhat impacted by disruptions related to COVID, we are encouraged by the early signs of recovery in that market. Gamers are responding enthusiastically to the new RTX 4090, 4080, 4070 Ti desktop GPUs, with many retail and online outlets quickly selling out of stock. The flagship RTX 4090 has quickly risen in popularity on Steam to claim the top spot for the AI architecture, reflecting gamers' desire for high-performance graphics. Earlier this month, the first phase of gaming laptops based on the Ada architecture reached retail shelves, delivering NVIDIA's largest-ever generational leap in performance and power efficiency. For the first time, we are bringing enthusiast-class GPU performance to laptops as slim as 14 inches, a fast-growing segment, previously limited to basic tasks and applications. In another first, we are bringing the 90-class GPUs, our most performing models, to laptops, thanks to the power efficiency of our fifth-generation Max-Q technology. All in all, RTX 40 Series GPUs will power over 170 gaming and creator laptops, setting up for a great back-to-school season. There are now over 400 games and applications supporting NVIDIA's RTX technology for real-time ray tracing and AI-powered graphics. The AI architecture features DLSS 3, our third-generation AI-powered graphics, which dramatically boosts performance. With the most advanced games, Cyberpunk 2077, recently added DLSS 3, enabling a 3 to 4x boost in frame rate performance at 4K resolution. Our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continued to expand in multiple dimensions\u2014users, titles, and performance. It now has more than 25 million members in over 100 countries. Last month, it enabled RTX 4080 graphics horsepower in the new high-performance ultimate membership tier. Ultimate members can stream at up to 240 frames per second from the cloud with full ray tracing and DLSS 3. And just yesterday, we made an important announcement with Microsoft. We agreed to a 10-year partnership to bring to GeForce NOW Microsoft's lineup of Xbox PC games, which includes blockbusters like Minecraft, Halo, and Flight Simulator. And upon the close of Microsoft's Activision acquisition, it will add titles like Call of Duty and Overwatch. Moving to Pro Visualization, revenue of $226 million was up 13% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago. Fiscal year revenue of $1.54 billion was down 27%. Sequential growth was driven by desktop workstations, with strengths in the automotive and manufacturing industrial verticals. Year-on-year decline reflects the impact of the channel inventory correction, which we expect to end in the first half of the year. Interest in NVIDIA's Omniverse continues to build with almost 300,000 downloads so far, 185 connectors to third-party design applications. The latest released Omniverse has a number of features and enhancements, including support for 4K, real-time path tracing, Omniverse Search for AI-powered search through large untagged 3D databases, and Omniverse cloud containers for AWS. Let's move to automotive. Revenue was a record $294 million, up 17% from the previous period and up 135% from a year ago. Sequential growth was driven primarily by AI automotive solutions. New program ramps at both electric vehicle and traditional OEM customers helped drive this growth. Fiscal year revenue of $903 million was up 60%. At CES, we announced a strategic partnership with Foxconn to develop automated and autonomous vehicle platforms. This partnership will provide scale for volume manufacturing to meet growing demand for the NVIDIA Drive platform. Foxconn will use NVIDIA Drive, Hyperion compute, and sensor architecture for its electric vehicles. Foxconn will be a Tier 1 manufacturer producing electronic control units based on NVIDIA Drive Orin for the global market. We also reached an important milestone this quarter. The NVIDIA Drive operating system received safety certification from T\u00dcV S\u00dcD, one of the most experienced and rigorous assessment bodies in the automotive industry. With industry-leading performance and functional safety, our platform meets the higher standards required for autonomous transportation. Moving to the rest of the P&L, GAAP gross margin was 63.3%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%. Fiscal year GAAP gross margin was 56.9%, and non-GAAP gross margin was 59.2%. Year-on-year, Q4 GAAP operating expenses were up 21%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 23%, primarily due to higher compensation and data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were flat, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We plan to keep them relatively flat at this level over the coming quarters. Full-year GAAP operating expenses were up 50%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 31%. We returned $1.15 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. At the end of Q4, we had approximately $7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me look to the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal '24. We expect sequential growth to be driven by each of our 4 major market platforms led by strong growth in data center and gaming. Revenue is expected to be $6.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 64.1% and 66.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.53 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $50 million, excluding gains and losses of non-affiliated divestments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 13%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $350 million to $400 million for the first quarter and in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion for the full fiscal year 2024. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our Investor Relations website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We will be attending the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference on March 6 in San Francisco and the Cowen Healthcare Conference on March 7 in Boston. We will also host GTC virtually with Jensen's keynote kicking off on March 21. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our first quarter of fiscal year '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, May 24.

Our announcement today about putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and having it hosted within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software. It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way to pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises.

The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers?

          "content": "Large language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million times over the last decade. Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100 times in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks, and algorithms and working with data scientists and AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster. What would have taken a couple of months in the beginning now happens in about 10 days. And of course, you still need a large infrastructure. And even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, new NVLink switches, and its new InfiniBand 400-gigabits per second data rates, allows us to take another leap in the processing of large language models. By putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access to this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. That's one thought. The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and their body of knowledge are different. Different fields and domains, whether it's imaging or biology or physics, each one of them needs their own domain of foundation models. Our strategy is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world, that would like to create proprietary data and associated proprietary models. Regarding competition, our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Our architecture is universal, meaning you can use it for training, you can use it for inference, and it supports every framework. It supports every cloud. It's everywhere. It's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem. It could be an autonomous system. This one architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy them everywhere. The second very large idea is that no AI is in itself an application. There's a preprocessing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post-processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or two-thirds of the overall workload. By accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline from preprocessing, data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing, and then to post-processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline. The limit to speed up, even if you're instantaneously passed if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate it 10, 20, or even 50 times faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear about 10x, 20x, or even 50x speed up. The universality of our accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud and from cloud to edge makes our architecture quite accessible and very differentiated in this way.",

The accumulation of all the breakthroughs led to a service that surprised everybody with its versatility and capability.

For this language model to not just speak English or translate, but to output Python, output COBOL, a language that few people even remember, or output Python for Blender, a 3D program. This type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because it's democratized programming to so many people, which has excited enterprises all over the world.

First of all, as you know, our data center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of 8 Hoppers or 8 Amperes connected with NVLink switches. This board represents essentially 1 GPU. It's 8 chips connected together into 1 GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. We've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. And that is 1 GPU. So when we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's 8 GPUs. We're going to continue to do that. The cloud service providers are really excited about this by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. All of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud and on-prem, often in multi-cloud. By having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure our full-stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them, and they welcomed us with open arms. For the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced. They have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open operating system, all the way up to AI models. Within 1 entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. This is a great model for customers, for CSPs, and for us. It lets us really run like the wind. We're going to continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, but it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem. It\u2019s hard no matter how you look at it.

It seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars.

There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry. Every single platform change, every inflection point in the way people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program, and more accessible. This happened with the PC revolution, and with the Internet revolution, and mobile cloud. Remember mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged. The same exact thing is now happening to AI. In no computing era did 1 computing platform, ChatGPT, reach 150 million people in 60 to 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing. People are using it to create all kinds of things. So I think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications emerging.

Many of them began that process many quarters ago. This was a time for us to get production levels to them in Q3. So Q4 was an important time for us to see a great ramp of H-100 that we saw. What that means is H-100 was the focus of many of our CSPs within Q4, and they all wanted to get up and running in cloud instances. So we actually saw less of A100 in Q4 than we saw in H-100 at a larger amount. We tend to continue to sell both architectures going forward, but in Q4, it was a strong quarter for H-100. Your additional questions regarding Mercedes Benz\u2014I'm very pleased with the joint connection that we have with them and the work. We've been working diligently to get ready to go to market. You're right. They talked about the software opportunity in two phases regarding what they can do with Drive as well as with Connect.

So that's my hook to come to GTC, and I think you're going to be very surprised and quite delighted by the applications that we're going to talk about. Now there's a reason why it is the case that you're constantly hearing about new applications. The reason for that is NVIDIA is a multi-domain accelerated computing platform. It is not completely general-purpose like a CPU because a CPU is 95% or 98% control functions and only 2% mathematics, which makes it completely flexible. We're not that way. We're an accelerated computing platform that works with the CPU that offloads the really heavy computing units, things that can be highly, highly parallelized. We can do particle systems, fluid simulations, deep learning, and computer graphics. There are all kinds of different applications that we can accelerate. Our installed base is so large. This is the only accelerated computing platform, the only one architecturally compatible across every single cloud\u2014from PCs to workstations, gamers to cars to on-prem. Every single computer is architecturally compatible, which means that a developer who developed something special would seek out our platform because they like the reach. They like the universal reach. They like the acceleration. Number one, they like the ecosystem of programming tools and the ease of using it, and they have so many people to reach out to for help. So all of these reasons are why we keep attracting new applications. I also want to highlight that the rate of CPU computing has slowed tremendously. Back in the first 30 years of my career, we expected a 10x increase in performance every 5 years. But that rate has slowed, while people still have pressing applications to bring to the world. By accelerating computing, we can decrease power requirements for any workload, which is another important factor driving the adoption of accelerated computing. So I believe that increasingly new workloads will be driven by generative AI and other forms of new computing.",

We are continuing with our new launches as well that are sometimes fueled by our GPU computing and networking. We expect generative AI to spark interest among our customers, whether those be CSPs, enterprises, or start-ups. We expect that to support our revenue growth this year.

The reason for that is AI\u2014 the production of intelligence is becoming a new form of manufacturing. There was a time when people manufactured physical goods. In the future, almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence. Data comes in, and that data center does exactly one thing: it processes that data and produces a new updated model. Where raw material comes in, a building or infrastructure processes it, and something refined or improved comes out that is of great value\u2014that's called the factory. So, I expect to see AI factories everywhere. Some of them will be hosted in the cloud, while some will be on-prem. Some will be large, some will be mega-large, and some will be smaller. I expect that to happen. Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms, and new AI algorithms, we will accelerate AI by another 1 million times. There are a lot of ways for us to do that. It's why NVIDIA is not just a chip company\u2014because the problem we're trying to solve is too complex. We have to think across the entire stack from chip to data center across the network through software. We can innovate across that entire span. My expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models and platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption, you'll see these AI factories everywhere.",

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. Q1 revenue was $7.19 billion, up 19% sequentially and down 13% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by record data center revenue, with our gaming and professional visualization platforms emerging from channel inventory corrections. Starting with data center, record revenue of $4.28 billion was up 18% sequentially and up 14% year-on-year, on strong growth by accelerated computing platform worldwide. Generative AI is driving exponential growth in compute requirements and a fast transition to NVIDIA accelerated computing, which is the most versatile, most energy-efficient, and the lowest TCO approach to train and deploy AI. Generative AI drove significant upside in demand for our products, creating opportunities and broad-based global growth across our markets. Let me give you some color across our three major customer categories, cloud service providers or CSPs, consumer Internet companies, and enterprises. First, CSPs around the world are racing to deploy our flagship Hopper and Ampere architecture GPUs to meet the surge in interest from both enterprise and consumer AI applications for training and inference. Multiple CSPs announced the availability of H100 on their platforms, including private previews at Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, upcoming offerings at AWS, and general availability at emerging GPU specialized cloud providers like CoreWeave and Lambda. In addition to enterprise AI adoption, these CSPs are serving strong demand for H100 from Generative AI pioneers. Second, consumer Internet companies are also at the forefront of adopting Generative AI and deep learning-based recommendation systems, driving strong growth. For example, Meta has now deployed its H100 powered Grand Teton AI supercomputer for its AI production and research teams. Third, enterprise demand for AI and accelerated computing is strong. We are seeing momentum in verticals such as automotive, financial services, healthcare, and telecom, where AI and accelerated computing are quickly becoming integral to customers' innovation roadmaps and competitive positioning. For example, Bloomberg announced it has a 50 billion parameter model, BloombergGPT, to help with financial natural language processing tasks such as sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, news classification, and question-answering. Auto Insurance company, CCC Intelligent Solutions is using AI for estimating repairs. And AT&T is working with us on AI to improve fleet dispatches so their field technicians can better serve customers. Among other enterprise customers using NVIDIA AI are Deloitte for logistics and customer service and Amgen for drug discovery and protein engineering. This quarter, we started shipping DGX H100, our Hopper generation AI system, which customers can deploy on-prem. And with the launch of DGX Cloud through our partnership with Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, we deliver the promise of NVIDIA DGX to customers from the cloud. Whether the customers deploy DGX on-prem or via DGX Cloud, they get access to NVIDIA AI software, including NVIDIA Base Command, AI frameworks, and pre-trained models. We provide them with the blueprint for building and operating AI, spanning our expertise across systems, algorithms, data processing, and training methods. We also announced NVIDIA AI Foundations, which are model foundry services available on DGX Cloud, that enable businesses to build, refine, and operate custom large language models and generative AI models, trained with our own proprietary data, created for unique domain-specific tasks. They include NVIDIA NeMo for large language models, NVIDIA Picasso for images, video, and 3D, and NVIDIA BioNeMo for life sciences. Each service has six elements, pre-trained models, frameworks for data processing and curation, proprietary knowledge-based sector databases, systems for fine-tuning, aligning, and guardrailing, optimized inference engines, and support from NVIDIA experts to help enterprises fine-tune models for their custom use cases. ServiceNow, a leading enterprise services platform, is an early adopter of DGX Cloud and NeMo. They are developing custom large language models trained on data specifically for the ServiceNow platform. Our collaboration will let ServiceNow create new enterprise-grade generative AI offerings, with the thousands of enterprises worldwide running on the ServiceNow platform, including for IT departments, customer service teams, employees, and developers. Generative AI is also driving a step-function increase in inference workloads. Because of their size and complexities, these workloads require acceleration. The latest MLPerf industry benchmark released in April showed NVIDIA's inference platform delivering performance that is orders of magnitude ahead of the industry, with unmatched versatility across diverse workloads. To help customers deploy generative AI applications at scale, at GTC, we announced four major new inference platforms that leverage the NVIDIA AI software stack. These include L4 Tensor Core GPU for AI video, L40 for Omniverse, and graphics rendering, H100 NVL for large language models, and the Grace Hopper Superchip for LLMs and also, recommendation systems and vector databases. Google Cloud is the first CSP to adopt our L4 inference platform with the launch of its G2 virtual machines for generative AI inference and other workloads such as Google Cloud Dataproc, Google AlphaFold, and Google Cloud's Immersive Stream, which render 3D and AR experiences. In addition, Google is integrating our Triton inference server with Google Kubernetes engine and its cloud-based Vertex AI platform. In networking, we saw strong demand at both CSPs and enterprise customers for generative AI and accelerated computing, which require high-performance networking like NVIDIA's Mellanox networking platforms. Demand relating to general purpose CPU infrastructure remains soft. As generative AI applications grow in size and complexity, high performance networks become essential for delivering accelerated computing at data center scale to meet the enormous demand of all training and inferencing. Our 400 gig Quantum-2 InfiniBand platform is the gold standard for AI dedicated infrastructure, with broad adoption across major cloud and consumer Internet platforms such as Microsoft Azure. With the combination of in-network computing technology and the industry's only end-to-end data center scale, optimized software stack, customers routinely enjoy a 20% increase in throughput for their sizable infrastructure investment. For multi-tenant cloud transitioning to support generative AI our high-speed Ethernet platform with BlueField-3 DPUs and Spectrum-4 Ethernet switching offers the highest available Ethernet network performance. BlueField-3 is in production and has been adopted by multiple hyperscale and CSP customers, including Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, CoreWeave, Baidu, and others. We look forward to sharing more about our 400 gig Spectrum-4 accelerated AI networking platform next week at the COMPUTEX Conference in Taiwan. Lastly, our Grace data center CPU is sampling with customers. At this week's International Supercomputing Conference in Germany, the University of Bristol announced a new supercomputer based on the NVIDIA Grace CPU Superchip, which is 6x more energy-efficient than the previous supercomputer. This adds to the growing momentum for Grace with both CPU only and CPU/GPU opportunities across AI and cloud and supercomputing applications. The coming wave of BlueField-3, Grace, and Grace Hopper Superchips will enable a new generation of super energy-efficient accelerated data centers. Now, let's move to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.24 billion was up 22% sequentially, and down 38% year-on-year. Strong sequential growth was driven by sales of the 40 Series GeForce RTX GPUs for both notebooks and desktops. Overall, end demand was solid, and consistent with seasonality, demonstrating resilience against a challenging consumer spending backdrop. The GeForce RTX 40 Series GPU laptops are off to a great start, featuring four NVIDIA inventions, RTX Path Tracing, DLSS 3 AI rendering, Reflex Ultra-Low Latency rendering, and Max-Q, energy-efficient technologies. They deliver tremendous gains in industrial design, performance, and battery life for gamers and creators. And like our desktop offerings, 40 Series laptops support the NVIDIA Studio platform or software technologies, including acceleration for creative data science and AI workflows, and Omniverse, giving content creators unmatched tools and capabilities. In desktop, we ramped the RTX 4070, which joined the previously launched RTX 4090, 4080, and 4070 Ti GPUs. The RTX 4070 is nearly 3x faster than the RTX 2070 and offers our large installed base a spectacular upgrade. Last week, we launched the 60 family, RTX 4060, and 4060 Ti, bringing our newest architecture to the world's core gamers starting at just $299. These GPUs for the first time provide 2x the performance of the latest gaming console at mainstream price points. The 4060 Ti is available starting today, while the 4060 will be available in July. Generative AI will be transformative to gaming and content creation from development to run time. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference earlier this week, we showcased how Windows PCs and workstations with NVIDIA RTX GPUs will be AI-powered at their core. NVIDIA and Microsoft have collaborated on end-to-end software engineering, spanning from the Windows operating system to the NVIDIA graphics drivers, and NeMo's LLM framework to help make Windows on NVIDIA RTX Tensor Core GPUs a supercharged platform for generative AI. Last quarter, we announced a partnership with Microsoft to bring Xbox PC games to GeForce NOW. The first game from this partnership, Gears 5, is now available with more set to be released in the coming months. There are now over 1,600 games on GeForce NOW, the richest content available on any cloud gaming service. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $295 million was up 31% sequentially, and down 53% year-on-year. Sequential growth was driven by stronger workstation demand across both mobile and desktop form factors, with strength in key verticals such as Public Sector, Healthcare, and Automotive. We believe the channel inventory correction is behind us. The ramp of our Ada Lovelace GPU architecture in workstations kicked off a major product cycle. At GTC, we announced six new RTX GPUs for laptops and desktop workstations, with further rollout planned in the coming quarters. Generative AI is a major new workload for NVIDIA-powered workstations. Our collaboration with Microsoft transformed Windows into the ideal platform for creators and designers, harnessing generative AI to elevate their creativity and productivity. At GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud, an NVIDIA fully managed service running in Microsoft Azure that includes the full suite of Omniverse applications and NVIDIA OVX infrastructure. Using this full stack cloud environment, customers can design, develop, deploy, and manage industrial metaverse applications. NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud will be available starting in the second half of this year. Microsoft NVIDIA will also connect Office 365 applications with Omniverse. Omniverse Cloud is being used by companies to digitalize their workflows from design and engineering to smart factories and 3D content generation for marketing. The automotive industry has been a leading early adopter of Omniverse, including companies such as BMW Group, Geely Lotus, General Motors, and Jaguar Land Rover. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $296 million, up 1% sequentially, and up 114% from a year ago. Our strong year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin across a number of new energy vehicles. As we announced in March, our automotive design win pipeline over the next six years now stands at $14 billion, up from $11 billion a year ago, giving us visibility into continued growth over the coming years. Sequentially, growth moderated as some NEV customers in China are adjusting their production schedules to reflect slower than expected demand growth. We expect this dynamic to linger for the rest of the calendar year. During the quarter, we expanded our partnership with BYD, the world's leading manufacturer of NEVs. Our new design win will extend BYD's use of the DRIVE Orin to its next-generation high-volume Dynasty and Ocean series of vehicles, set to start production in calendar 2024. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins was 64.6%, and non-GAAP gross margins were 66.8%. Gross margins have now largely recovered to prior peak level, and we have absorbed higher costs and offset them by innovating and delivering higher valued products as well as products incorporating more and more software. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were down 3%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were down 1%. We have held OpEx at roughly the same level over the last past four quarters. We're working through the inventory corrections in gaming and professional visualization. We now expect to increase investments in the business while also delivering operating leverage. We returned $99 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends. At the end of Q1, we have approximately $7 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 2023. Let me turn to the outlook for the second quarter fiscal '24. Total revenue is expected to be $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect this sequential growth to largely be driven by data center, reflecting a steep increase in demand related to generative AI and large language models. This demand has extended our data center visibility out a few quarters and we have procured substantially higher supply for the second half of the year. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 68.6% and 70% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.71 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $90 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $300 million to $350 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some of the upcoming events. Jensen will give the COMPUTEX keynote address in person in Taipei this coming Monday, May 29 local time, which will be Sunday evening in the U.S. In addition, we will be attending the BofA Global Technology Conference in San Francisco on June 6, the Rosenblatt Virtual Technology Summit on The Age of AI on June 7, and the New Street Future of Transportation Virtual Conference on June 12. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our second quarter fiscal '24 is scheduled for Wednesday, August 23. Well, that covers our opening remarks. We're now going to open the call for questions.

Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from data center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to what the key drivers are from April to July and perhaps more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point, what kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point? Thank you.",

          "content": "Okay. So, a lot of different questions there. So, let me see if I can start and I am sure Jensen will have some follow-up comments. So when we talk about our sequential growth that we're expecting between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI large language models are driving the surge in demand, and it's broad-based across both our consumer Internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises, and our AI start-ups. It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time. This is also a key area where deep recommendators are driving growth. And we also expect to see growth both in our computing as well as in our networking business. So, those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance we provided to Q2. We also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see, and this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers. They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises, but also setting things up at the CSPs and the large consumer Internet companies. So, we have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters and that's led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half. I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more.",

          "speaker": "Jensen Huang",
          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "Thank you for the question. I'll address the second part first. At the time when the ChatGPT moment occurred, we were already fully engaged in the production of both Ampere and Hopper. This situation underscored the transition from large language models to a chatbot-based product and service. The combination of safety measures, alignment systems, and reinforcement learning through human feedback, along with proprietary knowledge databases and search connections, came together beautifully. This alignment of technology reminded me of the iPhone moment, highlighting the potential and capabilities of such products.  NVIDIA has a robust supply chain, as you're aware, and we manufacture supercomputers in large volumes, which include not just the GPUs but thousands of other components necessary for data centers. So, when that pivotal moment arrived, we were already in full production. As Colette mentioned, we had to significantly enhance our procurement efforts for the latter half of the year.  Now, looking at the broader context, the world\u2019s data centers are increasingly moving toward accelerated computing. This has been a recognized challenge for a while; if we can effectively implement it across numerous application domains, we could reduce energy consumption and operational costs for data centers significantly. Although it\u2019s a costly endeavor because of the requisite software and system development, we've been working towards this for 15 years.  With the emergence of generative AI, we've found a compelling application for our computing platform that has been in development. We are currently witnessing simultaneous shifts. With the data center market valued at around $1 trillion, most of it is still reliant on CPUs and basic NICs, lacking acceleration. However, as generative AI becomes the primary workload, it becomes evident that the budget allocation for data centers will increasingly favor accelerated computing.  We are in the midst of this evolution, with a limited CapEx budget for data centers. Nonetheless, we are receiving substantial orders to update them. I believe we are at the onset of a decade-long transition where existing data centers will be repurposed for accelerated computing, leading to a notable shift in spending from traditional to advanced computing technologies, including smart NICs, smart switches, and GPUs, with generative AI at the forefront of workloads.",

We're constantly aware of this competition. However, NVIDIA's primary value is that we offer the lowest cost solution and the lowest total cost of ownership. This is because accelerated computing represents a full stack challenge; it requires engineering all software, libraries, and algorithms, integrating and optimizing them for the architecture of an entire data center, rather than just one chip. The engineering and fundamental computer science involved is exceptionally demanding.  In addition, generative AI presents a large-scale challenge that operates at a data center level, where the entire system\u2014including networking, distributed computing engines, and architecture\u2014functions as one integrated computer. To achieve optimal performance, a deep understanding of this full stack and data center scale is essential. Utilization is another critical factor, as it relates to the variety of applications we can accelerate. Our diverse architecture maintains high utilization; if a data center can only perform one task quickly, it risks underutilization and scalability issues. Our universal GPU accelerates numerous stacks, resulting in high throughput.  Furthermore, our experience in building data centers and integrating our architecture into global cloud systems is invaluable. The time from product delivery to operational readiness can take months if not executed proficiently; however, our operations typically span just a few weeks. We\u2019ve converted data centers and supercomputers into market-ready products, showcasing our team's expertise.

          "content": "Yeah. We can see in real-time the growth of generative AI and CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models, as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already. There are two segments that require a new stack of software and the two segments are enterprise and industrials. Enterprise requires a new stack of software, because many enterprises need to have all the capabilities that we've talked about, whether it's large language models, the ability to adapt, and for your proprietary use-case and your proprietary data, align it to your own principles, and your own operating domains. You want to have the ability to be able to do that in a high-performance computing sandbox, and we that DGX Cloud create a model. Then you want to deploy your chatbot or your AI in any Cloud, because you have services and you have agreements with multiple Cloud vendors and depending on the applications, you might deploy it on various clouds. And for the enterprise, we have NVIDIA AI Foundation for helping you create custom models and we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the only accelerated stack, GPU-accelerated stack in the world that is Enterprise safe and Enterprise supported. There are constant patches that you have to do, there are 4,000 different packages that build up NVIDIA AI Enterprise and represents the operating engine, end-to-end operating engine of the entire AI workflow. It's the only one of its kind from data ingestion, data processing, obviously, in order to train an AI model you have lots of data, you have to process and package up and curate, and align and there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data, that could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time and so data processing is a very big deal. And then the second aspect of it is training the model, refining the model and the third is deploying model for inferencing. NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports and patches and security patches continuously all of those 4,000 packages of software. And for an enterprise that wants to deploy their engines, just like they want to deploy Red Hat Linux, this is incredibly complicated software in order to deploy that in every cloud and as well as on-prem, it has to be secure, it has to be supported. And so, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the second point. The third is Omniverse. Just as people are starting to realize that you need to align an AI to ethics, the same for robotics, you need to align the AI for physics. And aligning an AI for ethics includes a technology called reinforcement learning human feedback. In the case of industrial applications and robotics, it's reinforcement learning Omniverse feedback. And Omniverse is a vital engine for software defined in robotic applications and industries. And so, Omniverse also needs to be a cloud service platform. And so our software stack, the three software stacks, AI Foundation, AI Enterprise, and Omniverse runs in all of the world's clouds that we have partnerships, DGX Cloud partnerships with. Azure, we have partnerships on both AI as well as Omniverse. With GTP and Oracle, we have great partnerships in DGX Cloud for AI and AI Enterprise is integrated into all three of them and so I think the in order for us to extend the reach of AI beyond the cloud, and into the world's Enterprise and into the world's industries, you need two new types of you need new software stacks in order to make that happen and by putting it in the cloud, integrate it into the world's CSP clouds, it's a great way for us to partner with the sales and the marketing team and the leadership team of all the cloud vendors.",

InfiniBand achieved a record quarter, and we anticipate a stellar year ahead with an outstanding roadmap for NVIDIA's Quantum InfiniBand. The two networking solutions are distinct; InfiniBand is tailored for an AI-focused environment. For instance, if a data center operates a limited number of applications for specific purposes continuously, and the infrastructure costs approximately $500 million, the difference in overall throughput between InfiniBand and Ethernet could range from 15% to 20%. If you invest $500 million in infrastructure and there's a throughput difference of 10% to 20%, that equates to about $100 million, making InfiniBand essentially free. This significant difference in data center throughput is a critical factor for its usage, especially for singular applications. On the other hand, in a multi-tenant cloud data center serving numerous users with many small jobs, Ethernet is the better choice. There is also a new segment emerging where the cloud is evolving into a generative AI cloud. Although it remains a multi-tenant environment, it is geared towards handling generative AI tasks. This segment presents an exciting opportunity, and at COMPUTEX, we plan to unveil a major product line focused on Ethernet for generative AI cloud applications.

Therefore, training is never truly complete. Producing and enhancing a Vector database that supplements the large language model is also a continuous effort. We are constantly vectorizing all the structured and unstructured data we collect. Whether it's a recommender system, a large language model, or a vector database, these are among the three primary applications driving the future of computing. While there are certainly other aspects involved, these key applications are always operational. More companies are beginning to recognize the importance of having what could be called an intelligence factory, mainly focused on training, processing, and vectorizing data, as well as developing representations of it.  When it comes to inference, there are APIs, whether they are open APIs that integrate with various applications or those embedded within workflows. Our company will offer numerous APIs\u2014some developed in-house and many from collaborations with partners like ServiceNow and Adobe, which will produce an array of generative AI APIs for others to incorporate into their workflows or applications. We are witnessing rapid growth in AI Factories and an emerging market for AI inference through APIs, practically increasing weekly.  In simple terms, we currently have an installed base of data centers worth $1 trillion, predominantly using CPUs. However, there is a growing acknowledgment that scaling these data centers with traditional computing methods is becoming impractical, as pointed out in discussions about the end of Moore's Law. The future lies in accelerated computing, which is now driven by generative AI. This means that the financial commitments towards infrastructure will heavily prioritize generative AI and accelerated computing technologies, including GPUs and advanced networking equipment. Over the next several years, a significant portion of that $1 trillion investment, adjusting for ongoing growth in data centers, will be focused primarily on generative AI, encompassing both training and inference.",

This is why we offer various sizes in our inference options. We recently introduced models like L4, L40, and H100, among others, which can be customized to fit different needs. It's important to note that these models are ultimately connected to applications that process different types of inputs and outputs, requiring extensive pre and post-processing that should not be overlooked. This processing often constitutes a significant portion of the overall inference workload. Therefore, the multifaceted nature of inference will be conducted across various environments, including cloud and on-premises solutions. Our AI Enterprise will facilitate this across all clouds.

While these might not be widely discussed because they can be complex, they enable us to connect tens of thousands of GPUs. Effective integration requires an exceptional infrastructure operating system, which is why we prioritize networking. With Mellanox, we have the leading technology in high-performance networking, which is why our companies have joined forces.  Our network capabilities start with NVLink, a low-latency computing fabric that communicates through memory references rather than traditional network packets. From NVLink, we connect multiple GPUs and expand beyond them, which I will elaborate on during COMPUTEX in a few days. This connects to InfiniBand, where we're fully producing SmartNIC BlueField-3 and optimized fiber optics. All of this runs efficiently. Furthermore, to link smart AI factories to our computing fabric, we\u2019ll introduce a new type of Ethernet at COMPUTEX.  The entire process of connecting GPUs and computing units through networking, switches, and software is incredibly intricate. We're pleased you recognize its complexity, but we don't separate it out because we view it as a unified computing platform. We provide these components to data centers worldwide, allowing them to integrate the system into various architectures while still running our software stack.

          "title": "CFO",
          "content": "Thanks, Simona. We had an exceptional quarter. Record Q2 revenue of $13.51 billion was up 88% sequentially and up 101% year-on-year, and above our outlook of $11 billion. Let me first start with Data Center. Record revenue of $10.32 billion was up 141% sequentially and up 171% year-on-year. Data Center compute revenue nearly tripled year-on-year, driven primarily by accelerating demand from cloud service providers and large consumer Internet companies for HGX platform, the engine of generative AI and large language models. Major companies, including AWS, Google Cloud, Meta, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud as well as a growing number of GPU cloud providers are deploying, in volume, HGX systems based on our Hopper and Ampere architecture Tensor Core GPUs. Networking revenue almost doubled year-on-year, driven by our end-to-end InfiniBand networking platform, the gold standard for AI. There is tremendous demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing and AI platforms. Our supply partners have been exceptional in ramping capacity to support our needs. Our data center supply chain, including HGX with 35,000 parts and highly complex networking has been built up over the past decade. We have also developed and qualified additional capacity and suppliers for key steps in the manufacturing process such as advanced packaging. We expect supply to increase each quarter through next year. By geography, data center growth was strongest in the U.S. as customers direct their capital investments to AI and accelerated computing. China demand was within the historical range of 20% to 25% of our Data Center revenue, including compute and networking solutions. At this time, let me take a moment to address recent reports on the potential for increased regulations on our exports to China. We believe the current regulation is achieving the intended results. Given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that additional export restrictions on our Data Center GPUs, if adopted, would have an immediate material impact to our financial results. However, over the long term, restrictions prohibiting the sale of our Data Center GPUs to China, if implemented, will result in a permanent loss of opportunity for the U.S. industry to compete and lead in one of the world's largest markets. Our cloud service providers drove exceptionally strong demand for HGX systems in the quarter, as they undertake a generational transition to upgrade their data center infrastructure for the new era of accelerated computing and AI. The NVIDIA HGX platform is the culmination of nearly two decades of full-stack innovation across silicon, systems, interconnects, networking, software and algorithms. Instances powered by the NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPUs are now generally available at AWS, Microsoft Azure and several GPU cloud providers, with others on the way shortly. Consumer Internet companies also drove very strong demand. Their investments in data center infrastructure purpose-built for AI are already generating significant returns. For example, Meta recently highlighted that since launching Reels, AI recommendations have driven a more than 24% increase in time spent on Instagram. Enterprises are also racing to deploy generative AI, driving strong consumption of NVIDIA powered instances in the cloud as well as demand for on-premise infrastructure. Whether we serve customers in the cloud or on-prem through partners or direct, their applications can run seamlessly on NVIDIA AI enterprise software with access to our acceleration libraries, pre-trained models and APIs. We announced a partnership with Snowflake to provide enterprises with an accelerated path to create customized generative AI applications using their own proprietary data, all securely within the Snowflake Data Cloud. With the NVIDIA NeMo platform for developing large language models, enterprises will be able to make custom LLMs for advanced AI services, including chatbots, search and summarization, right from the Snowflake Data Cloud. Virtually every industry can benefit from generative AI. For example, AI Copilot such as those just announced by Microsoft can boost the productivity of over 1 billion office workers and tens of millions of software engineers. Billions of professionals in legal services, sales, customer support and education will be able to leverage AI systems trained in their field. AI Copilot and assistants are set to create new multi-hundred billion dollar market opportunities for our customers. We are seeing some of the earliest applications of generative AI in marketing, media and entertainment. WPP, the world's largest marketing and communication services organization, is developing a content engine using NVIDIA Omniverse to enable artists and designers to integrate generative AI into 3D content creation. WPP designers can create images from text prompts while responsibly trained generative AI tools and content from NVIDIA partners such as Adobe and Getty Images using NVIDIA Picasso, a foundry for custom generative AI models for visual design. Visual content provider Shutterstock is also using NVIDIA Picasso to build tools and services that enable users to create 3D scene backgrounds with the help of generative AI. We've partnered with ServiceNow and Accenture to launch the AI Lighthouse program, fast-tracking the development of enterprise AI capabilities. AI Lighthouse unites the ServiceNow enterprise automation platform and engine with NVIDIA accelerated computing and with Accenture consulting and deployment services. We are also collaborating with Hugging Face to simplify the creation of new and custom AI models for enterprises. Hugging Face will offer a new service for enterprises to train and tune advanced AI models powered by NVIDIA HGX cloud. And just yesterday, VMware and NVIDIA announced a major new enterprise offering called VMware Private AI Foundation with NVIDIA, a fully integrated platform featuring AI software and accelerated computing from NVIDIA with multi-cloud software for enterprises running VMware. VMware's hundreds of thousands of enterprise customers will have access to the infrastructure and AI and cloud management software needed to customize models and run generative AI applications such as intelligent chatbots, assistants, search and summarization. We also announced new NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers featuring the new NVIDIA L40S GPU built for the industry standard data center server ecosystem and BlueField-3 DPU data center infrastructure processor. L40S is not limited by supply and is shipping to the world's leading server system makers. L40S is a universal data center processor designed for high volume data center delivery to accelerate the most compute-intensive applications, including AI training and inference through design, visualization, video processing and NVIDIA Omniverse industrial digitalization. NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers are fully optimized for VMware, Cloud Foundation and Private AI Foundation. Nearly 100 configurations of NVIDIA AI enterprise-ready servers will soon be available from the world's leading enterprise IT computing companies, including Dell, HP and Lenovo. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with Hopper GPU, entered full production and will be available this quarter in OEM servers. It is also shipping to multiple supercomputing customers, including Atmos, National Labs and the Swiss National Computing Center. And NVIDIA and SoftBank are collaborating on a platform based on GH200 for generative AI and 5G/6G applications. The second generation version of our Grace Hopper Superchip with the latest HBM3e memory will be available in Q2 of calendar 2024. We announced the DGX GH200, a new class of large memory AI supercomputer for large AI language models, recommendation systems and data analytics. This is the first use of the new NVIDIA switch system, enabling all of its 256 Grace Hopper Superchips to work together as one, a huge jump compared to our prior generation connecting just eight GPUs over a switch. DGX GH200 systems are expected to be available by the end of the year, with Google Cloud, Meta and Microsoft among the first to gain access. Strong networking growth was driven primarily by InfiniBand infrastructure to connect HGX GPU systems. Thanks to its end-to-end optimization and in-network computing capabilities, InfiniBand delivers more than double the performance of traditional Ethernet for AI. For billions of dollar AI infrastructures, the value from the increased throughput of InfiniBand is worth hundreds of millions of dollars and pays for the network. In addition, only InfiniBand can scale to hundreds of thousands of GPUs. It is the network of choice for leading AI practitioners. For Ethernet-based cloud data centers that seek to optimize their AI performance, we announced NVIDIA Spectrum-X, an accelerated networking platform designed to optimize Ethernet for AI workloads. Spectrum-X couples the Spectrum or Ethernet switch with the BlueField-3 DPU, achieving 1.5x better overall AI performance and power efficiency compared to traditional Ethernet. BlueField-3 DPU is a major success. It is in qualification with major OEMs and ramping across multiple CSPs and consumer Internet companies. Now moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.49 billion was up 11% sequentially and 22% year-on-year. Growth was fueled by GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs for laptops and desktops. End customer demand was solid and consistent with seasonality. We believe global end demand has returned to growth after last year's slowdown. We have a large upgrade opportunity ahead of us. Just 47% of our installed base have upgraded to RTX and about 20% of the GPU with an RTX 3060 or higher performance. Laptop GPUs posted strong growth in the key back-to-school season, led by RTX 4060 GPUs. NVIDIA's GPU-powered laptops have gained in popularity, and their shipments are now outpacing desktop GPUs from several regions around the world. This is likely to shift the reality of our overall gaming revenue a bit, with Q2 and Q3 as the stronger quarters of the year, reflecting the back-to-school and holiday build schedules for laptops. In desktop, we launched the GeForce RTX 4060 and the GeForce RTX 4060 TI GPUs, bringing the Ada Lovelace architecture down to price points as low as $299. The ecosystem of RTX and DLSS games continues to expand. 35 new games were added to DLSS support, including blockbusters such as Diablo IV and Baldur\u2019s Gate 3. There's now over 330 RTX accelerated games and apps. We are bringing generative AI to gaming. At COMPUTEX, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine or ACE for games, a custom AI model foundry service. Developers can use this service to bring intelligence to non-player characters. And it harnesses a number of NVIDIA Omniverse and AI technologies, including NeMo, Riva and Audio2Face. Now moving to Professional Visualization. Revenue of $375 million was up 28% sequentially and down 24% year-on-year. The Ada architecture ramp drove strong growth in Q2, rolling out initially in laptop workstations with a refresh of desktop workstations coming in Q3. These will include powerful new RTX systems with up to 4 NVIDIA RTX 6000 GPUs, providing more than 5,800 teraflops of AI performance and 192 gigabytes of GPU memory. They can be configured with NVIDIA AI enterprise or NVIDIA Omniverse inside. We also announced three new desktop workstation GPUs based on the Ada generation. The NVIDIA RTX 5000, 4500 and 4000, offering up to 2x the RT core throughput and up to 2x faster AI training performance compared to the previous generation. In addition to traditional workloads such as 3D design and content creation, new workloads in generative AI, large language model development and data science are expanding the opportunity in professional visualization for our RTX technology. One of the key themes in Jensen's keynote at the recent event was the conversion of graphics and AI. This is where NVIDIA Omniverse is positioned. Omniverse is OpenUSD's native platform. OpenUSD is a universal interchange that is quickly becoming the standard for the 3D world, much like HTML is the universal language for the 2D landscape. Together, Adobe, Apple, Autodesk, Pixar and NVIDIA form the Alliance for OpenUSD. Our mission is to accelerate OpenUSD's development and adoption. We announced new and upcoming Omniverse cloud APIs, including RunUSD and ChatUSD to bring generative AI to OpenUSD workload. Moving to automotive. Revenue was $253 million, down 15% sequentially and up 15% year-on-year. Solid year-on-year growth was driven by the ramp of self-driving platforms associated with a number of new energy vehicle makers. The sequential decline reflects lower overall automotive demand, particularly in China. We announced a partnership with MediaTek to bring drivers and passengers new experiences inside the car. MediaTek will develop automotive SoCs and integrate a new product line of NVIDIA's GPU chiplet. The partnership covers a wide range of vehicle segments from luxury to entry level. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded to 70.1% and non-GAAP gross margin to 71.2%, driven by higher data center sales. Our Data Center products include a significant amount of software and complexity, which is also helping drive our gross margin. Sequential GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 5%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. We returned approximately $3.4 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. Our Board of Directors has just approved an additional $25 billion in stock repurchases to add to our remaining $4 billion of authorization as of the end of Q2. Let me turn to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Demand for our Data Center platform where AI is tremendous and broad-based across industries on customers. Our demand visibility extends into next year. Our supply over the next several quarters will continue to ramp as we lower cycle times and work with our supply partners to add capacity. Additionally, the new L40S GPU will help address the growing demand for many types of workloads from cloud to enterprise. For Q3, total revenue is expected to be $16 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth to be driven largely by Data Center with gaming and Professional Visualization also contributing. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.5% and 72.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.95 billion and $2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $100 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 14.5%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our Investor Relations website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Jefferies Tech Summit on August 30 in Chicago, the Goldman Sachs Conference on September 5 in San Francisco, the Evercore Semiconductor Conference on September 6 as well as the Citi Tech Conference on September 7, both in New York. And the BofA Virtual AI conference on September 11. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our third quarter of fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Tuesday, November 21.",

          "content": "Thank you very much. Good afternoon. The results are impressive. Jensen, I have a question for you about the rapidly emerging application of large model inference. Most investors understand that you have secured a significant share of the training market. Previously, smaller model inference workloads were primarily handled by ASICs or CPUs. With the rise of large models like GPT, there's a new workload that is quickly gaining momentum in large model inference. I believe your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are well-suited for this. Can you discuss how you perceive the differentiation between small model inference and large model inference, and how your product portfolio is set up for this? Thank you.",

          "content": "Yeah. Thanks a lot. So let's take a quick step back. These large language models are pretty phenomenal. They have the ability to understand unstructured language. But at their core, what they have learned is the structure of human language. And they have encoded, or compressed within them, a large amount of human knowledge that they have learned from the corpuses they studied. What happens is, you create these large language models and make them as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teacher-student models. It's a process called distillation. And so when you see these smaller models, it's very likely they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, just as you have professors and teachers and students. This process will continue going forward. Start from a very large model, which has a vast amount of generality and what's called zero-shot capability. For many applications or skills that you haven't specifically trained it on, these large language models can miraculously perform them. That's what makes them so magical. Conversely, you desire these capabilities in all kinds of computing devices, so you distill them down. These smaller models might have excellent capabilities on particular skills, but they don't generalize well or lack good zero-shot capabilities. They each hold unique strengths, but the foundation starts with large models.",

And then Jensen, my question for you is, when we look at overall hyperscaler spending, that buy is not really growing that much. So what gives you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years? If I take your implied Q3 outlook of Data Center, $12 billion, $13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated? Where is that going? So just give some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next one to two years.",

I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me how much of Data Center in the quarter, maybe even the guide, is systems versus GPU, like DGX versus just the H100? I'm trying to understand how much pricing or content, however you want to define that, versus units is actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that?",

Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture, but also our Ampere architecture. We are still selling both of these architectures in the market. When you think about that, it means both the systems as a unit are growing quite substantially, driving revenue increases. Both of these are the drivers of the revenue inside Data Center. Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell. They are significant opportunities for enterprise customers as well as many different types of customers we're seeing even in our consumer Internet companies. The importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales. The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market, and we talk about the L40S, which will add continued growth going forward. But, again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system.",

But the H100 is composed of 35,000 parts, weighs 70 pounds, and contains nearly 1 trillion transistors combined. It takes a robot \u2013 actually many robots to build it because of its weight. It requires a supercomputer to test a supercomputer. So we often refer to the H100 as if it\u2019s a chip that comes off of a fab, but H100s go out as HGXs sent to the world\u2019s hyperscalers and are really, really quite large system components.",

Let me use some metrics: we have a runtime called AI Enterprise; if you will, it\u2019s the runtime that nearly every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning from data processing, the training of any model on any framework, inference, and the deployment scaling out into a data center. It can scale out for deploying in hyperscale data centers or enterprise data centers, for instance, on VMware. We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud across almost every single cloud. It runs in a single GPU configuration or multiple GPUs and multiple nodes throughout an entire data center scale. This runtime, called NVIDIA AI Enterprise, contains something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries, and something like 10,000 dependencies among each other. This runtime is continuously optimized for our installed base and our software stack. That\u2019s just one example of the effort it takes to get accelerated computing to work. The combinations of code and applications are quite immense, and it has taken us two decades to reach this point. The elements of our company, if you will, are several. Number one is architecture: the flexibility, versatility, and performance of our architecture allows us to do all the things I just mentioned. The second characteristic of our company is the installed base and the third is our reach: we\u2019re in the cloud today for public-facing services, which has attracted many developers and customers to use our platform, and we have a broad distribution from OEMs and ODMs. Then lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were able to sustain this complex stack of software and hardware across all of these diverse environments.

L40S is built to fine-tune models and it performs that remarkably well. It includes a transform engine and has a lot of performance. You can deploy multiple GPUs in a server. It's designed for hyperscale deployments, meaning it\u2019s easy to install L40S servers in hyperscale data centers.

It is too energy costly, too expensive, and yields slower performance for applications. Accelerated computing is now recognized as the new standard. Generative AI turbocharges this transition. However, accelerated computing can also provide solutions for numerous existing applications in the data center. By leveraging this approach, companies can reduce CPU workloads and save significant capital and energy costs while increasing throughput. Many companies are converting their investments from general-purpose computing to generative AI and accelerated computing as they understand these truths. This is evident from emerging GPU-specific cloud providers like CoreWeave, which is flourishing, and regional GPU-specialized service models proliferating globally. Enterprises also recognize the need to transition. However, to do so, they must manage systems, security, and software-defined data centers, which require partnerships with established IT firms like VMware. Our recent collaboration with VMware, who effectively serve numerous enterprise customers, aims to facilitate their transition to this landscape.",

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. Q3 was another record quarter. Revenue of $18.1 billion was up 34% sequentially and up more than 200% year-on-year and well above our outlook for $16 billion. Starting with Data Center, the continued ramp of the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper Tensor Core GPU architecture, along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking, drove record revenue of $14.5 billion, up 41% sequentially and up 279% year-on-year. NVIDIA HGX with InfiniBand together are essentially the reference architecture for AI supercomputers and data center infrastructures. Some of the most exciting generative AI applications are built and run on NVIDIA, including Adobe Firefly, ChatGPT, Microsoft 365 Copilot, CoAssist, now assist with ServiceNow and Zoom AI Companion. Our Data Center compute revenue quadrupled from last year and networking revenue nearly tripled. Investments in infrastructure for training and inferencing large language models, deep learning, recommender systems and generative AI applications are fueling strong broad-based demand for NVIDIA accelerated computing. Inferencing is now a major workload for NVIDIA AI computing. Consumer Internet companies and enterprises drove exceptional sequential growth in Q3, comprising approximately half of our Data Center revenue and outpacing total growth. Companies like Meta are in full production with deep learning, recommender systems and also investing in generative AI to help advertisers optimize images and text. Most major consumer Internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning. Enterprise software companies such as Adobe, Databricks, Snowflake and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and systems to their platforms. Broader enterprises are developing custom AI for vertical industry applications such as Tesla in autonomous driving. Cloud service providers drove roughly the other half of our Data Center revenue in the quarter. Demand was strong from all hyperscale CSPs, as well as from a broadening set of GPU-specialized CSPs globally that are rapidly growing to address the new market opportunities in AI. NVIDIA H100 Tensor Core GPU instances are now generally available in virtually every cloud with instances in high demand. We have significantly increased supply every quarter this year to meet strong demand and expect to continue to do so next year. We will also have a broader and faster product launch cadence to meet the growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. Towards the end of the quarter, the U.S. government announced a new set of export control regulations for China and other markets, including Vietnam and certain countries in the Middle East. These regulations require licenses for the export of a number of our products, including our Hopper and Ampere 100 and 800 series and several others. Our sales to China and other affected destinations derived from products that are now subject to licensing requirements have consistently contributed approximately 20% to 25% of Data Center revenue over the past few quarters. We expect that our sales to these destinations will decline significantly in the fourth quarter. We believe that will be more than offset by strong growth in other regions. The U.S. government designed the regulation to allow the U.S. industry to provide data center compute products to markets worldwide, including China. Continuing to compete worldwide as the regulations encourage, promotes U.S. technology leadership, spurs economic growth and supports U.S. jobs. For the highest performance levels, the government requires licenses. For lower performance levels, the government requires a streamlined prior notification process. For products even lower performance levels, the government does not require any notice at all. Following the government's clear guidelines, we are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to offer compliance solutions for each regulatory category, including products for which the U.S. government does not wish to have advance notice before each shipment. We are working with some customers in China and the Middle East to pursue licenses from the U.S. government. It is too early to know whether these will be granted for any significant amount of revenue. Many countries are awakening to the need to invest in sovereign AI infrastructure to support economic growth and industrial innovation. With investments in domestic compute capacity, nations can use their own data to train LLMs and support their local generative AI ecosystems. For example, we are working with India's government and largest tech companies including Infosys, Reliance and Tata to boost their sovereign AI infrastructure. A French private cloud provider, Scaleway, is building a regional AI cloud based on NVIDIA H100 InfiniBand and NVIDIA's AI Enterprise software to fuel advancement across France and Europe. National investment in compute capacity is a new economic imperative, serving the sovereign AI infrastructure market represents a multi-billion dollar opportunity over the next few years. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue in Q3 was driven by the NVIDIA HGX platform based on our Hopper GPU architecture with lower contribution from the prior generation Ampere GPU architecture. The new L40S GPU built for industry standard servers began to ship, supporting training and inference workloads across a variety of consumers. This was also the first revenue quarter of our GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip, which combines our ARM-based Grace CPU with a Hopper GPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are ramping into a new multi-billion dollar product line. Grace Hopper instances are now available at GPU-specialized cloud providers, and coming soon to Oracle Cloud. Grace Hopper is also gaining significant traction with supercomputing customers. Initial shipments to Los Alamos National Lab and the Swiss National Supercomputing Center took place in the third quarter. The UK government announced it will build one of the world's fastest AI supercomputers called Isambard-AI with almost 5,500 Grace Hopper Superchips. The German supercomputing center, Julich, also announced that it will build its next-generation AI supercomputer with close to 24,000 Grace Hopper Superchips and Quantum-2 InfiniBand, making it the world's most powerful AI supercomputer with over 90 exaflops of AI performance. All-in, we estimate that the combined AI compute capacity of all the supercomputers built on Grace Hopper across the U.S., Europe, and Japan next year will exceed 200 exaflops with more wins to come. Inference is contributing significantly to our data center demand, as AI is now in full production for deep learning, recommenders, chatbots, copilots, and text-to-image generation, and this is just the beginning. NVIDIA AI offers the best inference performance and versatility, resulting in lower power consumption and cost of ownership. We are also driving a fast cost reduction curve. With the release of TensorRT-LLM, we now achieved more than double the inference performance for half the cost of inferencing LLMs on NVIDIA GPUs. We also announced the latest member of the Hopper family, the H200, which will be the first GPU to offer HBM3e, faster, larger memory to further accelerate generative AI and LLMs. It moves inference speed up to another double compared to H100 GPUs for running LLMs like Norma2. Combined, TensorRT-LLM and H200 have increased performance or reduced cost by four times in just one year. With our customers changing their stack, this is a benefit of CUDA and our architecture compatibility. Compared to the A100, H200 delivers an 18 times performance increase for inferencing models like GPT-3, allowing customers to move to larger models without an increase in latency. Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle Cloud will be among the first CSPs to offer H200-based instances starting next year. At last week's Microsoft Ignite, we deepened and expanded our collaboration with Microsoft across our entire stack. We introduced an AI foundry service for the development and tuning of custom generative AI enterprise applications running on Azure. Customers can bring their domain knowledge and proprietary data, and we help them build their AI models using our expertise and software stack in our DGX cloud, all with enterprise-grade security and support. SAP and Amdocs are the first customers of the NVIDIA AI foundry service on Microsoft Azure. In addition, Microsoft will launch new confidential computing instances based on the H100. The H100 remains the top-performing and most versatile platform for AI training by a wide margin, as shown in the latest MLPerf industry benchmark results. Our training cluster included more than 10,000 H100 GPUs or three times more than in June, reflecting very efficient scaling. Efficient scaling is a key requirement in generative AI, because LLMs are growing by an order of magnitude every year. Microsoft Azure achieved similar results on a nearly identical cluster, demonstrating the efficiency of NVIDIA AI in public cloud deployments. Networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. Strong growth was driven by exceptional demand for InfiniBand, which grew fivefold year-on-year. InfiniBand is critical to gaining the scale and performance needed for training LLMs. Microsoft made this very point last week, highlighting that Azure uses over 29,000 miles of InfiniBand cabling, enough to circle the globe. We are expanding NVIDIA networking into the Ethernet space. Our new Spectrum-X end-to-end Ethernet offering with technologies purpose-built for AI will be available in the first quarter next year. With support from leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, and Lenovo. Spectrum-X can achieve 1.6 times higher networking performance for AI communication compared to traditional Ethernet offerings. Let me also provide an update on our software and services offerings, where we are starting to see excellent adoption. We are on track to exit the year at an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion for our recurring software, support, and service offerings. We see two primary opportunities for growth over the intermediate term with our DGX cloud service and with our NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, each reflecting the growth of enterprise AI training and inference, respectively. Our latest DGX cloud customer announcement was this morning as part of an AI research collaboration with Gentech, the biotechnology pioneer also plans to use our BioNeMo LLM framework to help accelerate and optimize their AI drug discovery platform. We now have enterprise AI partnerships with Adobe, Dropbox, Getty, SAP, ServiceNow, Snowflake, and others to come. Moving to Gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.86 billion was up 15% sequentially and up more than 80% year-on-year with strong demand in the important back-to-school shopping season with NVIDIA RTX ray tracing and AI technology now available at price points as low as $299. We entered the holidays with the best-ever line-up for gamers and creators. Gaming has doubled relative to pre-COVID levels even against the backdrop of lackluster PC market performance. This reflects the significant value we've brought to the gaming ecosystem with innovations like RTX and DLSS. The number of games and applications supporting these technologies has exploded in that period, driving upgrades and attracting new buyers. The RTX ecosystem continues to grow. There are now over 475 RTX-enabled games and applications. Generative AI is quickly emerging as the new pillar app for high-performance PCs. NVIDIA RTX GPUs define the most performance AI PCs and workstations. We just released TensorRT-LLM for Windows, which speeds on-device LLM inference up by four times. With an installed base of over 100 million, NVIDIA RTX is the natural platform for AI application developers. Finally, our GeForce NOW cloud gaming service continues to build momentum. Its library of PC games surpassed 1,700 titles, including the launches of Alan Wake 2, Baldur's Gate 3, Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty and Starfield. Moving to the Pro Visualization segment. Revenue of $416 million was up 10% sequentially and up 108% year-on-year. NVIDIA RTX is the workstation platform of choice for professional design, engineering, and simulation use cases, and AI is emerging as a powerful demand driver. Early applications include inference for AI imaging in healthcare and edge AI in smart spaces and the public sector. We launched a new line of desktop workstations based on NVIDIA RTX Ada Lovelace generation GPUs and ConnectX SmartNICs, offering up to double the AI processing ray tracing and graphics performance of the previous generations. These powerful new workstations are optimized for AI workloads such as fine-tuning AI models, training smaller models, and running inference locally. We continue to make progress on Omniverse, our software platform for designing, building, and operating 3D virtual worlds. Mercedes-Benz is using Omniverse powered digital twins to plan, design, build, and operate its manufacturing and assembly facilities, helping it increase efficiency and reduce defects. Oxxon is also incorporating Omniverse into its manufacturing process, including end-to-end simulation for the entire robotics and automation pipeline, saving time and cost. We announced two new Omniverse Cloud services for automotive digitalization available on Microsoft Azure, a virtual factory simulation engine and an autonomous vehicle simulation engine. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $261 million, up 3% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year, primarily driven by continued growth in self-driving platforms based on NVIDIA DRIVE Orin SOC and the ramp of AI cockpit solutions with global OEM customers. We extended our automotive partnership with Foxconn to include NVIDIA DRIVE for our next-generation automotive SOC. Foxconn has become the ODM for EVs. Our partnership provides Foxconn with a standard AV sensor and computing platform for their customers to easily build a state-of-the-art safe and secure software-defined car. Now we're going to move to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin expanded to 74% and non-GAAP gross margin to 75%, driven by higher Data Center sales and lower net inventory reserve, including a 1 percentage point benefit from the release of previously reserved inventory related to the Ampere GPU architecture products. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 12% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 10%, primarily reflecting increased compensation and benefits. Let me turn to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Total revenue is expected to be $20 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect strong sequential growth to be driven by Data Center, with continued strong demand for both compute and networking. Gaming will likely decline sequentially as it is now more aligned with notebook seasonality. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 74.5% and 75.5%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.17 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $200 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 15%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial information is included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the UBS Global Technology Conference in Scottsdale, Arizona, on November 28; the Wells Fargo TMT Summit in Rancho Palos Verdes, California, on November 29; the Arete Virtual Tech Conference on December 7; and the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco on January 8. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2024 is scheduled for Wednesday, February 21. We will now open the call for questions.",

We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long-term. We are working to expand our Data Center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation compliance solutions that do not require a license; these products may become available in the coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4.",

          "content": "Generative AI is the largest total addressable market expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. At the core of it, what's really exciting is that what was largely a retrieval-based computing approach, almost everything that you do is retrieved off of storage somewhere, has now been augmented with a generative method. And it has changed almost everything. You could see that in text-to-text, text-to-image, text-to-video, text-to-3D, text-to-protein, text-to-chemicals; these were things that were processed and typed in by humans in the past, and these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data has changed. It used to be based on explicit queries. It is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. We\u2019re excited about the work that we're doing with SAP, Dropbox, and many others that you'll hear about. One of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about $1 trillion or so, has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. Now there\u2019s a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants. Instead of being manually used, these tools will have copilots to help you use it. We will connect all of these copilots and assistants into teams of AIs, which will be the modern version of enterprise business software. The transformation of software and the way it is being done is driving the hardware underneath. You can see that it's transforming hardware in two ways. One is related to accelerated computing; general-purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. Now, that we have much better approaches, called accelerated computing, you can save an order of magnitude of energy, you can save an order of magnitude of time or you can save an order of magnitude of cost by using acceleration. Accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general-purpose computing into this new approach. This has been augmented by a new class of data centers. Unlike traditional data centers, these new data centers consist of very few applications, if not one application, used by a single tenant that processes data, trains models, and generates tokens and AI. We call these new data centers AI factories. We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere, by every country. In terms of expansion, you saw the first wave with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups, and consumer Internet companies ramping that. Meanwhile, while that's being ramped, we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies that would like to build chatbots and copilots to augment the tools they host on their platforms. You're seeing GPU specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world, and they are dedicated to processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, as countries now recognize that they need to keep their own culture and data, process that data, and develop their own AI. This is evident in India, several last year, in Sweden, and last week in France. The number of sovereign AI clouds being built is significant. My guess is that almost every major region and indeed every major country will have their own AI clouds. I believe that we are witnessing new developments as the generative AI wave spreads through every industry, every company, and every region. So, we are at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition.",

          "content": "Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already on a $10 billion plus run rate, and it's going to get much larger. As you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories standardize on InfiniBand. This is not only because of its data rate and latency but also the way it moves traffic around the network. The way that you process AI in a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic patterns are radically different. With InfiniBand and software-defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation, and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the data rate and the low latency that's natural to InfiniBand. InfiniBand is not just a network; it's also a computing fabric. We've incorporated many software-defined capabilities into the fabric, including computation. We will perform 40-point calculations and computation right on the switch in the fabric itself. The differences between Ethernet and InfiniBand, especially for AI factories, are profound. If you've invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories, a 20%, 25%, or 30% difference in overall effectiveness translates to hundreds of millions of dollars in value. Renting that infrastructure over four to five years adds up. The value proposition of InfiniBand for AI factories is undeniable. However, as we transition AI into enterprise, we want to empower every company to build its own custom AIs. We create custom AIs in our company based on our proprietary data and skills. For example, we've acquired one of the models, called ChipNeMo, and we're building many others. There will be tens to hundreds of custom AI models created inside our company. Our AI must run in an Ethernet environment, so we invented a new platform that extends Ethernet; it doesn\u2019t replace Ethernet, it is 100% compliant with it. It's optimized for East-West traffic, where the computing fabric operates. It adds an end-to-end solution with Bluefield, as well as our Spectrum switch, enabling us to perform some of the capabilities we have in InfiniBand, though not all. We've achieved excellent results.

We're expecting next year just with all of the design wins we have in high-performance computing and AI infrastructures, we're on a very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multi-billion dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us. The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It can create computing nodes that simultaneously utilize both very fast memory and very large memory. In the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what's called retrieval augmented generation, you can have a generative AI model refer to proprietary data or factual data before generating a response, which is often quite large. You can also have applications or generative models where the context length is significantly high. This way, you can store entire books into system memory before you ask your questions. The context length can indeed be very large. These generative models can interact naturally as well as refer to factual data, proprietary data, or domain-specific data, providing contextual relevance and reducing hallucination.

We have already one of the broadest, largest, and most capable supply chains in the world. Now, remember, people think that the GPU is just a chip, but the HGX H100, the Hopper HGX has 35,000 parts, weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. Even its passive components are incredible, consisting of high voltage, high frequency, and high current parts. It is a supercomputer, and the only way to test it is with another supercomputer. Every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated. The remarkable team here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly. I'm super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. Meanwhile, we are adding new customers and new products. So we have new supply. Different regions are stood up with GPU specialist clouds, and sovereign AI clouds are emerging across the globe, as nations realize the need to preserve their knowledge and culture by developing their own AI infrastructure. Enterprises, as private companies, must build their own custom AIs, recognizing that they can\u2019t afford to export their country\u2019s intelligence to others. They realize they must create tools for their own customers to access this intelligence. We have a new service called an AI foundry, leveraging NVS capabilities to support them in that. We're witnessing waves of generative AI starting with start-ups and CSPs, moving to consumer Internet companies and enterprise software platforms, and ultimately to industrial generative AI. This transition to generative AI and accelerated computing promises to impact every company, every industry, and every nation tremendously.",

The premise is, I still get a lot of questions from investors who think about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and somehow inferencing, even large model inference takes more and more of the total addressable market that the market will become increasingly competitive and you'll be less differentiated, et cetera. So I guess the two parts of the question are: number one, could you spend a little bit of time discussing the evolution of the inference workload as we transition to LLMs and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference? Second, up until a month or two ago, I never really received any questions about the data processing piece of the AI workloads; the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, and after inference. I think that's a large part of the workload now. Could you talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload? Thanks.",

          "content": "Sure. Inference is complicated. It's incredibly complicated. We announced one of the most exciting new engines, optimizing compilers called TensorRT-LLM this quarter. The reception has been incredible. You go to GitHub\u2014it\u2019s been downloaded many times, gaining attention and integration into tech stacks globally, almost instantaneously. There are several reasons for that, clearly. The development of TensorRT-LLM was made possible because CUDA is programmable. Without CUDA and our GPUs being so programmable, rapid software stack enhancements would be nearly impossible. TensorRT-LLM improves performance on the same GPU, doubling the efficiency without any human intervention. H200 increases it by another factor of two. Thus, our inference performance\u2014another way to express inference cost\u2014has declined by a factor of four within this last year. It\u2019s really challenging for others to keep up with this pace. The reason so many gravitate toward our inference engine is our long-standing installed base. We've dedicated over 20 years to building this, and it shows: our installed base is the largest globally, spanning every single cloud, every enterprise system in every industry. Anytime you come across NVIDIA's GPU, it's tied to our software. The architectural compatibility is paramount. It\u2019s our top priority. The sense of certainty in the platform is why everyone chooses to build upon NVIDIA first. The engineering work we have invested, all the advancement of technologies on top of NVIDIA benefits all those who use our GPUs. Data processing is incredibly crucial. Before training a model, you must clean, curate, deduplicate, and potentially augment the data with synthetic sources. This data isn't measured merely in bytes or megabytes. Instead, it's measured in terabytes and petabytes. The effort devoted to data processing, before subsequent data engineering and training, is considerable and can compose 30%, 40%, or even 50% of the total job. Ultimately, this necessitates creating robust, effective machine learning. To that end, we've accelerated Spark and Python frameworks. One of our recent features is called cuDF Pandas, where without changing a line of code, the single most successful data science framework in the world now operates at full speed with NVIDIA CUDA. The acceleration we\u2019re providing has garnered immense enthusiasm. People are incredibly excited as Pandas was designed explicitly for data processing and data science.",

When combining TensorRT-LLM with H200, customers save costs for large model inference by a factor of four. While this includes speeds and data metrics, the critical aspect lies in our software improvements and architectural stability. Our goal is to enhance our roadmap speed for it. The second reason is to promote broad generative AI adoption. The configurations in the traditional data center are changing. NVIDIA is integrated across various clouds, each with unique platforms, networking control planes, and security postures, yet we adjust our architecture to fit seamlessly into these stacks. We're simultaneously establishing standalone AI factories integrating our solutions for supercomputers and enterprises. We\u2019re now bringing AI to enterprises in ways no one else has done before, thereby laying the groundwork for our market rollout. The intricacies of technology and segmentation, paired with our architecture compatibility across all segments, provides an incredible reach into the market. Our investments span domains like healthcare, manufacturing, AI, financial services, supercomputing, and more. The range of markets we enhance with domain-specific libraries is broadening exponentially. We provide a comprehensive solution for data centers, comprising InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86, ARM, and many combination solutions, assuring a cross-segment ecosystem of developers, software solution providers, and extensive distribution partnerships. This incredible reach necessitates sizeable effort. However, the discipline we established in maintaining architectural compatibility has remained consistent.

Large language models, start-ups, consumer Internet companies, and global cloud service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand. Enterprise software companies like Adobe and Dropbox, SAP, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. Enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity. The generative AI era is in full motion and has created the need for a new type of data center, an AI factory, optimized for refining data, training, inference, and generating AI. AI factory workloads differ significantly from legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which provide substantial software total addressable market expansion and drive new investment. We're expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering an AI industrial revolution. NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack define an AI factory today. As we expand our supply chain to meet global demand, we are also constructing new growth drivers for the upcoming AI wave. We highlighted three elements in our new growth strategy gaining momentum: CPU, networking, and software and services. Grace is NVIDIA's first data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production, ramping into a multi-billion dollar product line next year. Irrespective of the CPU choice, we can help customers construct an AI factory. NVIDIA networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew fivefold year-on-year and is positioned for significant growth as the networking solution for AI factories. Enterprises race to adopt AI, and Ethernet is the standard networking solution. This week, we announced an Ethernet for AI platform for enterprises. NVIDIA Spectrum-X is an end-to-end solution combining Bluefield SuperNIC, Spectrum-4 Ethernet switch, and software that boosts Ethernet performance by 1.6 times for AI workloads. Dell, HPE, and Lenovo have joined us to deliver a complete generative AI solution, integrating NVIDIA AI computing, networking, and software for global enterprises.

          "content": "Thanks, Simona. Q4 was another record quarter. Revenue of $22.1 billion was up 22% sequentially and up 265% year-on-year and well above our outlook of $20 billion. For fiscal 2024, revenue was $60.9 billion and up 126% from the prior year. Starting with data center. Data center revenue for the fiscal 2024 year was $47.5 billion, more than tripling from the prior year. The world has reached the tipping point of a new computing era. The $1 trillion installed base of data center infrastructure is rapidly transitioning from general purpose to accelerated computing. As Moore's Law slows while computing demand continues to skyrocket, companies may accelerate every workload possible to drive future improvement in performance, TCO and energy efficiency. At the same time, companies have started to build the next generation of modern data centers, what we refer to as AI factories, purpose-built to refine raw data and produce valuable intelligence in the era of generative AI. In the fourth quarter, data center revenue of $18.4 billion was a record, up 27% sequentially and up 409% year-over-year, driven by the NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing platform along with InfiniBand end-to-end networking. Compute revenue grew more than fivefold and networking revenue tripled from last year. We are delighted that the supply of Hopper architecture products is improving. Demand for Hopper remains very strong. We expect our next-generation products to be supply constrained as demand far exceeds supply. Fourth quarter data center growth was driven by both training and inference of generative AI and large language models across a broad set of industries, use cases and regions. The versatility and leading performance of our data center platform enables a high return on investment for many use cases, including AI training and inference, data processing and a broad range of CUDA accelerated workloads. We estimate that in the past year approximately 40% of data center revenue was for AI inference. Building and deploying AI solutions has reached virtually every industry. Many companies across industries are training and operating their AI models and services at scale, enterprises across NVIDIA AI infrastructure through cloud providers, including hyperscales, GPU specialized and private clouds or on-premise. NVIDIA's computing stack extends seamlessly across cloud and on-premise environments, allowing customers to deploy with a multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud strategy. In the fourth quarter, large cloud providers represented more than half of our data center revenue, supporting both internal workloads and external public cloud customers. Microsoft recently noted that more than 50,000 organizations use GitHub Copilot business to supercharge the productivity of their developers, contributing to GitHub revenue growth accelerating to 40% year-over-year. And Copilot for Microsoft 365 adoption grew faster in its first two months than the two previous major Microsoft 365 enterprise suite releases did. Consumer internet companies have been early adopters of AI and represent one of our largest customer categories. Companies from search to e-commerce, social media, news and video services and entertainment are using AI for deep learning-based recommendation systems. These AI investments are generating a strong return by improving customer engagement, ad conversion and click-through rates. Meta in its latest quarter cited more accurate predictions and improved advertiser performance as contributing to the significant acceleration in its revenue. In addition, consumer internet companies are investing in generative AI to support content creators, advertisers and customers through automation tools for content and ad creation, online product descriptions and AI shopping assistance. Enterprise software companies are applying generative AI to help customers realize productivity gains. Early customers we've partnered with for both training and inference of generative AI are already seeing notable commercial success. ServiceNow's generative AI products in their latest quarter drove their largest ever net new annual contract value contribution of any new product family release. We are working with many other leading AI and enterprise software platforms as well, including Adobe, Databricks, Getty Images, SAP and Snowflake. The field of foundation large-language models is thriving. Anthropic, Google, Inflection, Microsoft, OpenAI and xAI are leading with continuing breakthroughs in generative AI. Exciting companies like Adept, AI21, Character.ai, Cohere, Mistral, Perplexity and Runway are building platforms to serve enterprises and creators. New startups are creating LLMs to serve the specific languages, cultures and customs of many regions. Others are creating foundation models to address entirely different industries like Recursion Pharmaceuticals and Generate:Biomedicines for biology. These companies are driving demand for NVIDIA AI infrastructure through hyperscale or GPU specialized cloud providers. Just this morning, we announced that we've collaborated with Google to optimize its state-of-the-art new Gemma language models to accelerate their inference performance on NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud data center and PC. One of the most notable trends over the past year is the significant adoption of AI by enterprises across industry verticals such as automotive, healthcare and financial services. NVIDIA offers multiple application frameworks to help companies adopt AI in vertical domains such as autonomous driving, drug discovery, low latency machine learning for fraud detection or robotics, leveraging our full stack accelerated computing platform. We estimate the data center revenue contribution of the automotive vertical through the cloud or on-premise exceeded $1 billion last year. NVIDIA DRIVE infrastructure solutions include systems and software for the development of autonomous driving, including data ingestion, creation, labeling and AI training, plus validation through simulation. Almost 80 vehicle manufacturers across global OEMs, new energy vehicles, trucking, robotaxi and Tier 1 suppliers are using NVIDIA's AI infrastructure to train LLMs and other AI models for automated driving and AI cockpit applications. In fact, nearly every automotive company working on AI is working with NVIDIA. As AV algorithms move to video transformers and more cars are equipped with cameras, we expect NVIDIA's automotive data center processing demand to grow significantly. In healthcare, digital biology and generative AI are helping to reinvent drug discovery, surgery, medical imaging and wearable devices. We have built deep domain expertise in healthcare over the past decade, creating the NVIDIA Clara healthcare platform and NVIDIA BioNeMo, a generative AI service to develop, customize and deploy AI foundation models for computer-aided drug discovery. BioNeMo features a growing collection of pre-trained biomolecular AI models that can be applied to the end-to-end drug discovery processes. We announced Recursion is making available for their proprietary AI model through BioNeMo for the drug discovery ecosystem. In financial services, customers are using AI for a growing set of use cases from trading and risk management to customer service and fraud detection. For example, American Express improved fraud detection accuracy by 6% using NVIDIA AI. Shifting to our data center revenue by geography, growth was strong across all regions, except for China where our data center revenue declined significantly following the U.S. government export control regulations imposed in October. Although we have not received licenses from the U.S. government to ship restricted products to China, we have started shipping alternatives that don't require a license for the China market. China represented a mid-single digit percentage of our data center revenue in Q4, and we expect it to stay in a similar range in the first quarter. In regions outside of the U.S. and China, sovereign AI has become an additional demand driver. Countries around the world are investing in AI infrastructure to support the building of large-language models in their own language, on domestic data and in support of their local research and enterprise ecosystems. From a product perspective, the vast majority of revenue was driven by our Hopper architecture along with InfiniBand networking. Together, they have emerged as the de-facto standard for accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. We are on track to ramp H200 with initial shipments in the second quarter. Demand is strong as H200 nearly doubles the inference performance of H100. Networking exceeded a $13 billion annualized revenue run rate. Our end-to-end networking solutions define modern AI data centers. Our Quantum InfiniBand solutions grew more than fivefold year on year. NVIDIA Quantum InfiniBand is the standard for the highest performance AI-dedicated infrastructures. We are now entering the ethernet networking space with the launch of our new Spectrum-X end-to-end offering designed for AI-optimized networking for the data center. Spectrum-X introduces new technologies over ethernet that are purpose-built for AI. Technologies incorporated in our Spectrum switch, BlueField DPU and software stack deliver 1.6 times higher networking performance for AI processing compared with traditional ethernet. Leading OEMs, including Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Super Micro, with their global sales channels, are partnering with us to expand our AI solutions to enterprises worldwide. We are on track to ship Spectrum-X this quarter. We also made great progress with our software and services offerings, which reached an annualized revenue run rate of $1 billion in Q4. We announced that NVIDIA DGX Cloud will expand its list of partners to include Amazon's AWS, joining Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Oracle Cloud. DGX Cloud is used for NVIDIA's own AI R&D and custom model development as well as NVIDIA developers. It brings the CUDA ecosystem to NVIDIA CSP partners. Okay, moving to gaming. Gaming revenue of $2.87 billion was flat sequentially and up 56% year on year, better than our outlook on solid consumer demand for NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs during the holidays. Fiscal year revenue of $10.45 billion was up 15%. At CES, we announced our GeForce RTX 40 Super Series family of GPUs. Starting at $599, they deliver incredible gaming performance and generative AI capabilities. Sales are off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Tensor cores and the GPUs deliver up to 836 AI tops, perfect for powering AI for gaming and creating everyday productivity. The rich software stack we offer with our RTX GPUs further accelerates AI. With our DLSS technologies, seven out of eight pixels can be AI-generated, resulting in up to four times faster ray tracing and better image quality. And with the Tensor RT LLM for Windows, our open-source library that accelerates inference performance for the latest large-language models generative AI can run up to five times faster on RTX AI PCs. At CES, we also announced a wave of new RTX 40 Series AI laptops from every major OEM. These bring high-performance gaming and AI capabilities to a wide range of form factors, including 14-inch and thin-and-light laptops. With up to 686 tops of AI performance, these next-generation AI PCs increase generative AI performance by up to 60 times, making them the best-performing AI PC platforms. At CES, we announced NVIDIA Avatar Cloud Engine microservices, which allowed developers to integrate state-of-the-art generative AI models into digital avatars. ACE won several Best of CES 2024 awards. NVIDIA has an end-to-end platform for building and deploying generative AI applications for RTX PCs and workstations. This includes libraries, SDKs, tools and services developers can incorporate into their generative AI workloads. NVIDIA is fueling the next wave of generative AI applications coming to the PC. With over 100 million RTX PCs in the installed base and over 500 AI-enabled PC applications and games, we are on our way. Moving to Pro Visualization. Revenue of $463 million was up 11% sequentially and up 105% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.55 billion was up 1%. Sequential growth in the quarter was driven by a rich mix of RTX Ada architecture GPUs continuing to ramp. Enterprises are refreshing their workstations to support generative AI-related workloads, such as data preparation, LLM fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation. These key industrial verticals driving demand include manufacturing, automotive and robotics. The automotive industry has also been an early adopter of NVIDIA Omniverse as it seeks to digitize workflows from design to build, simulate, operate and experience their factories and cars. At CES, we announced that creative partners and developers including Brickland, WPP and ZeroLight are building Omniverse-powered car configurators. Leading automakers like LOTUS are adopting the technology to bring new levels of personalization, realism and interactivity to the car-buying experience. Moving to Automotive. Revenue was $281 million, up 8% sequentially and down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal year revenue of $1.09 billion was up 21%, crossing the $1 billion mark for the first time on continued adoption of the NVIDIA DRIVE platform by automakers. NVIDIA DRIVE Orin is the AI car computer of choice for software-defined AV fleets. Its successor, NVIDIA DRIVE Thor, designed for vision transformers, offers more AI performance and integrates a wide range of intelligent capabilities into a single AI compute platform, including autonomous driving and parking, driver and passenger monitoring and AI cockpit functionality and will be available next year. There were several automotive customer announcements this quarter, including Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, ZEEKR, the premium EV subsidiary of Geely and Jeremy Xiaomi EV, all announced new vehicles built on NVIDIA. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margins expanded sequentially to 76% and non-GAAP gross margins to 76.7% on strong data center growth and mix. Our gross margins in Q4 benefited from favorable component costs. Sequentially, GAAP operating expenses were up 6% and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 9%, primarily reflecting higher compute and infrastructure investments and employee growth. In Q4, we returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends. During fiscal year '24, we utilized cash of $9.9 billion towards shareholder returns, including $9.5 billion in share repurchases. Let me turn to the outlook for the first quarter. Total revenue is expected to be $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. We expect sequential growth in data center and pro visualization, partially offset by seasonal decline in gaming. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 76.3% and 77% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. Similar to Q4, Q1 gross margins are benefiting from favorable component costs. Beyond Q1, for the remainder of the year, we expect gross margins to return to the mid-70% range. GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $3.5 billion and $2.5 billion respectively. Fiscal year 2025 GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to grow in the mid-30% range as we continue to invest in the large opportunities ahead of us. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $250 million, excluding gains and losses from non-affiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 17%, plus or minus 1% excluding any discrete items. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight some upcoming events for the financial community. We will attend the Morgan Stanley Technology and Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco on March 4, and the TD Cowen's 44th Annual Healthcare Conference in Boston on March 5. And of course, please join us for our Annual DTC conference starting Monday, March 18 in San Jose, California, to be held in person for the first time in five years. DTC will kick off with Jen-Hsun's keynote and we will host a Q&A session for financial analysts the next day, March 19. At this time, we will now open the call for questions.",

Clearly, you're doing extremely well in the business. I'm curious how your expectations for calendar '24 and '25 have evolved over the past 90 days. And as you answer the question, I was hoping you can touch on some of the newer buckets within data center, things like software. Sovereign AI, I think you've been pretty vocal about how to think about that medium-to-long term. And recently, there was an article about NVIDIA potentially participating in the ASIC market. Is there any credence to that, and if so, how should we think about you guys playing in that market over the next several years? Thank you.",

          "content": "Okay. Yeah. Well, we guide one quarter at a time. But fundamentally, the conditions are excellent for continued growth calendar '24, to calendar '25 and beyond. And let me tell you why? We're at the beginning of two industry-wide transitions and both of them are industry wide. The first one is a transition from general to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing, as you know, is starting to run out of steam. And you can tell by the CSPs extending and many data centers, including our own for general-purpose computing, extending the depreciation from four to six years. There's just no reason to update with more CPUs when you can't fundamentally and dramatically enhance its throughput like you used to. And so you have to accelerate everything. This is what NVIDIA has been pioneering for some time. With accelerated computing, you can dramatically improve your energy efficiency. You can dramatically improve your cost in data processing by 20 to 1. Huge numbers. And of course, the speed. That speed is so incredible that we enabled a second industry-wide transition called generative AI. Generative AI, I'm sure we're going to talk plenty about it during the call. But remember, generative AI is a new application. It is enabling a new way of doing software, new types of software are being created. It is a new way of computing. You can't do generative AI on traditional general-purpose computing. You have to accelerate it. The third is enabling a whole new industry, and this is something worthwhile to take a step back and look at and it connects to your last question about sovereign AI. A whole new industry in the sense that for the very first time a data center is not just about computing data and storing data and serving the employees of a company. We now have a new type of data center that is about AI generation, an AI generation factory. You've heard me describe it as AI factories. But basically, it takes raw material, which is data, transforms it with these AI supercomputers that NVIDIA builds, and turns them into incredibly valuable tokens. These tokens are what people experience on the amazing ChatGPT or Midjourney or search these days are augmented by that. All of your recommender systems are now augmented by that, the hyper-personalization that goes along with it. All of these incredible startups in digital biology are generating proteins and chemicals, among other things. These tokens are produced in a specialized type of data center, which we refer to as AI supercomputers and AI generation factories. We are witnessing diversity, and one of the key reasons is how it translates into new markets, reflecting all the diversity you are observing in our initiatives. The level of inference we are performing is exceptionally high now. Nearly every time you interact with ChatGPT, we are utilizing inference. Whenever you use Midjourney, we are applying inference. Each time you see the incredible Sora videos being created or the videos edited with Runway, NVIDIA is engaged in inference. The inference aspect of our business has experienced significant growth, estimated at around 40%. The amount of training is ongoing as these models continue to expand, leading to an increase in inference. Additionally, we are branching out into new industries. The large CSPs are still continuing to build out. You can see from their CapEx and their discussions, but there's a whole new category called GPU specialized CSPs. They specialize in NVIDIA AI infrastructure, GPU specialized CSPs. You're seeing enterprise software platforms deploying AI. ServiceNow is just a really, really great example. You see Adobe, there's the others, SAP and others. You see consumer Internet services that are now augmenting all of their services of the past with generative AI. So they can have even more hyper-personalized content created. You see us talking about industrial generative AI. Now our industries represent multi-billion dollar businesses, auto, health, financial services. In total, our vertical industries are multi-billion dollar businesses now. And of course sovereign AI. The reason for sovereign AI has to do with the fact that the language, the knowledge, the history, the culture of each region are different and they own their own data. They would like to use their data, train it to create their own digital intelligence and provision it to harness that raw material themselves. It belongs to them, each one of the regions around the world. The data belongs to them. The data is most useful to their society. And so they want to protect the data. They want to transform it themselves, value-added transformation into AI and provision those services themselves. So we're seeing sovereign AI infrastructure being built in Japan, in Canada, in France, and so many other regions. I expect that what is happening in the United States and the West will be seen globally, and AI generation factories will emerge in every industry, company, and region. Over the past year, we have witnessed generative AI developing into a new application space, a new approach to computing, and the creation of a whole new industry, which is driving our growth.",

          "content": "I'll go backwards. The estimate is probably understated. Let me explain why. A year ago, the recommender systems people use when browsing the internet, accessing news, watching videos, listening to music, or shopping rely on this technology. The internet has trillions of items available, and considering that our phones are only a few inches square, the capability to condense all that information into such a small space relies on an impressive system known as recommender systems. These recommender systems used to be all based on CPU approaches. But the recent migration to deep learning and now generative AI has really put these recommender systems now directly into the path of GPU acceleration. It needs GPU acceleration for the embeddings, it needs GPU acceleration for the nearest neighbor search, it needs GPU acceleration for the re-ranking and it needs GPU acceleration to generate the augmented information for you. So GPUs are in every single step of a recommender system now. As you know, recommender systems are the single largest software engine on the planet. Almost every major company in the world has to run these large recommender systems. Whenever you use ChatGPT, it's being inferenced. Whenever you hear about Midjourney and just the number of things that they're generating for consumers, when you see Getty, the work that we do with Getty and Firefly from Adobe, these are all generative models. The list goes on, and none of these, as I mentioned, existed a year ago, 100% new.",

Our supply chain is doing an incredible job, covering everything from wafers, packaging, memories, power regulators, to transceivers, networking, and cables. Many people think of NVIDIA GPUs as just chips, but the NVIDIA Hopper GPU consists of 35,000 parts and weighs 70 pounds. These are complex systems we've developed, often referred to as AI supercomputers for good reason. If you look at the data center, the cabling system is remarkably dense and intricate, unlike anything the world has seen before. Our InfiniBand business has grown fivefold year on year, and the supply chain is exceptionally supportive of us. And so overall, the supply is improving. We expect the demand will continue to be stronger than our supply provides through the year and we'll do our best. The cycle times are improving and we're going to continue to do our best. However, whenever we have new products, as you know, it ramps from zero to a very large number. And you can't do that overnight. Everything is ramped up. It doesn't step up. Whenever we have a new generation of products, right now we are ramping H200's. There is no way we can reasonably keep up with demand in the short term as we ramp. We're ramping Spectrum-X. We're doing incredibly well with Spectrum-X. It's our brand-new product in the ethernet space. InfiniBand serves as the standard for systems dedicated to AI. Traditional ethernet isn't ideal for scaling, but with Spectrum-X, we've enhanced ethernet with new features like adaptive routing, congestion control, and noise or traffic isolation, allowing us to optimize it for AI. InfiniBand will serve as our infrastructure for AI, while Spectrum-X provides AI-optimized networking, which is currently ramping up. Given the introduction of new products, demand is outpacing supply. This is typical for new products, and we're working as quickly as we can to meet that demand.

And I guess the two sides of the question are, I guess, first for Colette, like how are you guys thinking about allocation of product in terms of customer readiness to deploy and sort of monitoring if there's any kind of build-up of product that might not yet be turned on? And then I guess Jen-Hsun, for you, I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about the thought that you and your company are putting into the allocation of your product across customers, many of which compete with each other, across industries to smaller startup companies, to things in the healthcare arena to government. It's a very, very unique technology that you're enabling, and I'd be really interested to hear you speak a bit about how you think about quote/unquote fairly allocating sort of for the good of your company, but also for the good of the industry.

The folks that we work with, our customers that we work with, have been partners with us for many years as we have been assisting them both in what they set up in the cloud, as well as what they are setting up internally. Many of these providers have multiple products going at one time to serve so many different needs across their end customers but also what they need internally. So they are working in advance, of course, thinking about those new clusters that they will need. And our discussions with them continue not only on our Hopper architecture, but helping them understand the next wave and getting their interest and getting their outlook for the demand that they want. So it's always a moving process in terms of what they will purchase, what is still being built and what is in use for our end customers.

We strive for fairness in our allocation processes. Regarding end markets, we have a strong ecosystem composed of OEMs, ODMs, CSPs, and importantly, the end markets themselves. What NVIDIA is really unique about is that we bring our customers, we bring our partners, CSPs and OEMs, we bring them customers. The biology companies, the healthcare companies, financial services companies, AI developers, large-language model developers, autonomous vehicle companies, robotics companies.

All of these startups, large companies, healthcare, financial services and auto and such are working on NVIDIA's platform. We support them directly. Oftentimes, we can have a twofer by allocating to a CSP and bringing the customer to the CSP at the same time. This ecosystem, you're absolutely right that it's vibrant.

Our inventory on hand given our allocation that we're on, we're trying to, as things come into inventory, immediately work to ship them to our customers. I think our customer appreciates our ability to meet the schedules we've looked for. The second piece of it is our purchase commitments. Our purchase commitments have many different components into it, components that we need for manufacturing. But also, often we are procuring capacity that we may need. The length of that need for capacity or the length for the components are all different. Some of them may be for the next two quarters, but some of them may be for multiple years. I can say the same regarding our prepaids. Our prepaids are pre-designed to make sure that we have the reserve capacity that we need at several of our manufacturing suppliers as we look forward. So wouldn't read into anything regarding approximately about the same numbers as we are increasing our supply.

When you think about the million-x improvement in GPU compute over the last decade and expectations for similar improvements in the next, how do your customers think about the long-term usability of their NVIDIA investments that they're making today? Do today's training clusters become tomorrow's inference clusters? How do you see this playing out? Thank you.",

          "content": "Thank you for the question, CJ. The impressive aspect is that our platform has two key features: it is accelerated and programmable, making it robust. NVIDIA is the only architecture that has evolved from the very beginning when CNNs were first introduced by pioneers like Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoff Hinton with AlexNet, through various advancements including RNNs, LSTMs, reinforcement learning, and deep learning to transformers. We have been able to support, optimize, and deploy every version and variation of AI that has emerged, including vision transformers, multi-modality transformers, and time sequence models, ensuring that we can adapt to and enhance our existing technology. This is really the amazing part. On one hand, we can innovate with new architectures and technologies such as our Tensor cores, the transformer engine for Tensor cores, and improved numerical formats and processing structures, like we've done with different generations of Tensor cores, while also supporting the existing installations. This means all of our new software algorithm innovations and model inventions can operate on our current installed base. On the other hand, whenever we encounter something revolutionary, like transformers, we can create something entirely new, such as the Hopper transformer engine, and incorporate it into future generations. Don't be surprised if in our future generation, all of a sudden amazing breakthroughs in large-language models were made possible. Those breakthroughs, some of which will be in software because they run CUDA, will be made available to the installed base. And so we carry everybody with us on the one hand. We make giant breakthroughs on the other hand.",

I know that in your prepared comments you said that you started shipping some alternative solutions into China. You also put it out that you expect that contribution to continue to be about a mid-single digit percent of your total data center business. So I guess the question is what is the extent of products that you're shipping today into the China market and why should we not expect that maybe other alternative solutions come to the market and expand your breadth to participate in that in that opportunity again?

The U.S. government would like to see us be as successful in China as possible. Within those two constraints, within those two pillars if you will, are the restrictions, and so we had to pause when the new restrictions came out. We immediately paused to understand the restrictions and reconfigured our products to ensure they are not hackable in any way. This process took some time, and we adjusted our product offerings for China. We are currently sampling to customers in China and will strive to compete and succeed in that market while adhering to the restrictions. Last quarter, our business significantly declined as we halted shipments. We anticipate this quarter will be similar, but after that, we hope to compete effectively and see how things unfold.",

I wanted to talk about, a little bit about your software business and it's pleasing to hear that it's over a $1 billion but I was hoping Jen-Hsun or Colette if you could just help us understand what the different parts and pieces are for the software business? In other words, just help us unpack it a little bit, so we can get a better understanding of where that growth is coming from.",

          "content": "Let me take a step back and explain the fundamental reason why NVIDIA will be very successful in software. So first, as you know, accelerated computing really grew in the cloud. In the cloud, the cloud service providers have really large engineering teams and we work with them in a way that allows them to operate and manage their own business. Whenever there are any issues, we have large teams assigned to them. Their engineering teams are working directly with our engineering teams and we enhance, fix, maintain, patch the complicated stack of software that's involved in accelerated computing. As you know, accelerated computing is very different than general-purpose computing. You're not starting from a program like C++. You compile it and things run on all your CPUs. The various software stacks needed for different domains, such as data processing, structured data, unstructured data like images and text, classical machine learning, computer vision, speech, and large language models, require distinct software stacks. This is why NVIDIA has a multitude of libraries. Without software, you cannot enter new markets or facilitate new applications. Software is essential for accelerated computing. This is the fundamental difference between accelerated computing and general-purpose computing that most people took a long time to understand. Now people realize that software is truly key. The way we collaborate with cloud service providers is straightforward. We have large teams working alongside their large teams. However, generative AI is now empowering every enterprise and enterprise software company to adopt accelerated computing, which has become essential since it is no longer feasible to achieve improved throughput through just general-purpose computing. All of these enterprise software companies and enterprise companies don't have large engineering teams to be able to maintain and optimize their software stack to run across all the world's clouds and private clouds and on-prem. So we are going to do the management, the optimization, the patching, the tuning, the installed-base optimization for all of their software stacks. We containerize them into our stack. We call it NVIDIA AI Enterprise. The way we go to market with it is that think of NVIDIA AI Enterprise now as a runtime like an operating system, it's an operating system for artificial intelligence. We charge $4,500 per GPU per year. My guess is that every enterprise in the world, every software enterprise company that are deploying software in all the clouds, private clouds and on-prem, will run on NVIDIA AI Enterprise, especially obviously for our GPUs. This is going to likely be a very significant business over time. We're off to a great start. And Colette mentioned that it's already at a $1 billion run rate and we're really just getting started.",

          "content": "The computer industry is currently undergoing two major platform transitions simultaneously. The massive installed base of data centers is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. Every data center will adopt accelerated computing to meet the growing demand for processing power while managing costs and energy consumption. NVIDIA has significantly propelled this shift, enabling a new computing paradigm in generative AI, which allows software to learn, comprehend, and produce information ranging from human language to the complexities of biology and the 3D world. We are on the verge of a new industry where AI-specialized data centers will handle vast amounts of raw data, transforming it into digital intelligence. Much like AC power generation plants during the last industrial revolution, NVIDIA's AI supercomputers are essentially manufacturing facilities for AI in this current Industrial Revolution. Every company in every industry is fundamentally built on their proprietary business intelligence, and in the future, their proprietary generative AI. Generative AI has initiated a new investment cycle aimed at constructing the next trillion dollars' worth of AI generation infrastructure. We believe these trends will lead to a doubling of the world\u2019s data center infrastructure in the next five years and will represent an annual market opportunity in the hundreds of billions. This new AI infrastructure will enable a range of applications that are not feasible today. We began our AI journey with hyperscale cloud providers and consumer internet companies, and now every industry is involved, including automotive, healthcare, financial services, industrial, and telecom, media, and entertainment. NVIDIA's full stack computing platform, equipped with industry-specific application frameworks and a vast developer and partner ecosystem, provides the speed, scale, and reach to transform every company into an AI company. We have much to share at next month's GTC in San Jose, so we encourage you to join us. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tejas, and good afternoon. Today, we are proud to announce Apple's biggest quarter ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue record of nearly $124 billion, up 11% from last year and better than we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that our active installed base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8 billion devices. We set all-time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said would be supply constrained. As expected, in the aggregate, we experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter. Before I discuss our results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge the toll that COVID continues to have on communities around the world. In many places, case counts are higher and health systems more strained than at any point throughout the pandemic. On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend our deep gratitude to the scientists, doctors, nurses, and so many others on the front lines of combating COVID-19. This is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the pandemic. And while I can't say it gets any easier, I can say I'm incredibly proud of the way our teams have come together and continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. A few weeks ago, we marked the 15th anniversary of the day Steve revealed iPhone to the world. We knew that we had the beginnings of something fundamentally transformative, though none of us could have predicted the incredible and meaningful impact it would have on all of our lives. The creative spirit that made the first iPhone possible has thrived at Apple every day since. We never stop creating. We never stop innovating. You can see that spirit reflected throughout our products from the incredible performance and capability of our M1 chips to our powerful yet easy-to-use operating systems to our unrivaled iPhone camera systems to the beauty and magic of AirPods. That's why each of our major products leads the industry in customer satisfaction for their respective category. People expect Apple to solve hard problems with easy-to-use products. And iPhone has never been more popular. During the December quarter, we set an all-time revenue record for iPhone, thanks to the strength of our incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This is the best iPhone lineup we've ever had, and the reaction from the press and our users has been off the charts. This past quarter, we also set another all-time revenue record for Mac with customers eager to get their hands on an M1-powered MacBook Air, iMac, or MacBook Pro. We've been thrilled with the response from Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips and to see how Apple silicon is blowing them away with its power, performance, and efficiency. Despite the constraints I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup continues to be indispensable to tens of millions of people, from teachers and students to artists and creators. Customers are eager to get their hands on our ninth-generation iPad, which features a beautiful display and double the storage capacity, as well as the new iPad Mini with its ultra-portable design. Wearables, Home, and Accessories, meanwhile, set an all-time revenue record. Customers are loving the Apple Watch Series 7, with its cutting-edge health and fitness tracking features. Nearly every day, I get notes from customers who share how a heart alert led to a life-saving appointment with a cardiologist. And more recently, I've been hearing from people who tell me that their Apple Watch saved their lives by calling 911 when they couldn't. As I've said, we're still in the early innings with our health work that every day I'm encouraged by our positive impact. We are also making great advancements in audio and are seeing strong demand from customers as a result. The HomePod Mini continues to earn praise for combining the intelligence of Siri with an immersive room-filling audio experience. And our customers have responded with a lot of excitement to the magic of spatial audio on AirPods which packs the acoustics of a concert hall. As always, the deep integration of hardware, software, and services is a hallmark of everything Apple makes. It's a principle you can see at work in the introduction of SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole new way to create shared experiences by letting users watch and listen to their favorite content together on FaceTime. And we continue to invest in innovation across our services business, which set another all-time revenue record last quarter and performed even better than we had anticipated. The App Store continues to be an economic miracle for developers around the world and a safe and trusted place for consumers to discover their favorite apps. Since its launch, we have paid developers selling digital goods and services more than $260 billion, with 2021 setting a new record for their earnings. I'm also happy to report that in its first 2 years, Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned 200 award wins and more than 890 nominations. Among the powerful lineup are feature films like The Tragedy of Macbeth, CODA, and Swan Song, along with many gripping new series coming up, including Severance and The Afterparty. Each one is a tremendous credit to all the storytellers in front of the cameras and behind them who touched audiences all over the world. Fitness+, meanwhile, continues to inspire customers to reach their health and fitness goals. We recently introduced Time to Run, an extension of our popular series Time to Walk, as well as new collections of workouts and meditations to help users make more intentional training choices. Despite the pandemic, our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple's history, and we also earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores. That is a testament to the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we've reimagined digital experiences. I also want to take a moment to thank our retail employees and AppleCare teams for the deep care you've given to our customers as they look to get the most out of our products, learn new skills, or track down the perfect gift. We have always led with our values and with compassion and care, and never has that been more needed than during the pandemic. Last quarter, we celebrated 10 years of our Employee Giving program, which we started to help our employees identify and support the causes they care most deeply about. We pledged to match their contributions to organizations doing important work at every level from their local food pantry to global humanitarian non-profits. In the last decade, this program has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations. We also celebrated 15 years of Apple's partnership with a global fund on Project RED supporting their life-saving work to expand healthcare services in Sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV/AIDS. With the support of our customers, we've now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing, and counseling services for people impacted by HIV/AIDS. And in keeping with our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also launched a new partnership with the Boys & Girls Club of America. This initiative will help young people across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone Can Code curriculum. And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat climate change. We are already carbon neutral across our own operations, and we are working intensely to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the lifecycle of our products. To celebrate Black History Month, we will be releasing a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Braided Solo Loop and a matching Unity Lights Watch Face. And through our racial equity and justice initiative, we are continuing to support organizations blazing trails to a more equitable world in our economies, our classrooms, and our criminal justice system. We recognize, as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our most profound challenges. And at Apple, we are determined to do our part. That includes our own work in inclusion and diversity, which we are advancing every day. Let me close by saying that despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one thing of which I am certain: Apple will continue to innovate every day and in every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best. I will now turn it over to Luca to go over our quarterly results in more detail.",

          "speaker": "Luca Maestri",
          "title": "CFO",
          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the December quarter. We set an all-time revenue record of $123.9 billion, an 11% increase from a year ago. We reached new all-time records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China, and the rest of Asia Pacific. And it was also an all-time record quarter for both products and services. On the product side, revenue was $104.4 billion, up 9% over a year ago, despite significant supply constraints. We grew in each of our product categories, except iPad, where supply constraints were particularly pronounced, and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, and Wearables, Home and Accessories. The strong level of sales performance, the unmatched loyalty of our customers, and the strength of our ecosystem have driven our current installed base of active devices to a new all-time record of 1.8 billion devices. The growth in the installed base was broad-based as we set all-time records in each major product category and in each geographic segment. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24% over a year ago, with December quarter records in every geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.8%, up 160 basis points from last quarter due to volume leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by higher cost structures. Products gross margin was 38.4%, up 410 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 72.4%, up 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income of $34.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10 both grew more than 20% year-over-year and were all-time records. Operating cash flow of $47 billion was also an all-time record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 9% year-over-year to an all-time record of $71.6 billion despite supply constraints, thanks to a remarkable customer response to our new iPhone 13 family. We set all-time records in both developed and emerging markets, reached an all-time high in the iPhone active installed base, and the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. For Mac, revenue of $10.9 billion was an all-time record with growth of 25% year-over-year driven by strong demand for our newly redesigned MacBook Pro powered by M1 despite supply constraints. We are 1 year into our transition to Apple silicon, and already, the vast majority of our Mac sales are from M1-powered devices, which helped drive a record number of upgraders during the December quarter. Our momentum in this category is very impressive as the last 6 quarters have been the best 6 quarters ever for Mac. iPad generated $7.2 billion in revenue, down 14% year-over-year due to very significant supply constraints, but customer demand was very strong across all models. Despite the supply shortages, our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, thanks to a high number of customers that are new to iPad. In fact, around half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories set a new all-time record of $14.7 billion, up 13% year-over-year. And we set all-time revenue records in each geographic segment. We also continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this category to create unique experiences showcasing our deep integration of hardware, software, and services. In addition to an outstanding level of sales performance globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to services. As I mentioned, we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24%, with all-time records for cloud services, for music, video, advertising, and payment services, and a December quarter record for the App Store. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we are seeing on many fronts. First, as I mentioned before, our installed base has continued to grow and has reached an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during the December quarter in every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong growth. We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, we're adding new services that we think our customers will love, and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings. Just in this last quarter, we have added incredible new content on Apple TV+, on Fitness+, and Apple Arcade and a brand-new way to listen to music with Apple Music Voice. We also announced in November the beta program for Apple Business Essentials, a new service offering that brings together device management 24/7 support and iCloud storage to our small businesses, managing the end-to-end lifecycle of their employees' Apple devices. We are very excited that many thousands of small business customers are already actively participating in the beta program. This announcement is just one of many ways we are expanding our support for enterprise and business customers. With the latest MacBook Pros that we've introduced last October, the new M1-powered Mac lineup has quickly become the preferred choice of Macs among enterprise customers. Shopify, for example, is upgrading its entire global workforce to M1-powered MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. By standardizing on M1 Max, Shopify continues its commitment to providing the best tools to help its employees work productively and securely from anywhere. And Deloitte Consulting is expanding the deployment of the Mac Employee Choice program, including offering the new M1 MacBook Pro to empower their professionals to choose devices that work best for them in delivering consulting services. Let me now turn to our cash position. Due to our strong operating performance and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash, plus marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $123 billion. As a result, net cash was $80 billion at the end of the quarter. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we were able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, and we're also able to return nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the December quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. We also began a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 30 million shares. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue record despite significant supply constraints, which we estimate to be less than what we experienced during the December quarter. We expect our revenue growth rate to decelerate from the December quarter, primarily due to 2 factors. First, during the March quarter a year ago, we grew revenue by 54%. Remember that last year, we launched our new iPhones during the December quarter, while this year, we launched them during the September quarter. Due to the later launch a year ago, some of the associated channel inventory fill occurred during the March quarter last year. As a result of the different launch timing, we will face a more challenging year-over-year compare. Second, we expect foreign exchange to be a 3-point headwind when compared to the December quarter growth rate. We currently expect FX to have a negative impact on growth of 2 points in the March quarter, while it represented a 1 point benefit during the December quarter. Specifically related to Services, we expect to grow strong double digits but decelerate from the December quarter performance. This is due to a more challenging compare because a higher level of lockdowns around the world last year led to increased usage of digital content and services. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.5 billion and $12.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $150 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on February 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2022. And with that, let's open the call to questions.",

On product gross margins, that's clearly benefiting from a very strong mix. So Tim, I'm curious how sustainable do you think these mix trends are from the data that you see? And can you share any thoughts across how the Pro and Pro Max mix compared to prior cycles? And on the services side, if I could just ask that, too. When you look at the gross margins there, that's been really impressive. Can you give us some sense of where within services, you're seeing particularly favorable mix trends? And how should investors think about the trajectory of these margins given some of the sizable investments you're making to drive very successful areas like content for TV+ as an example?",

And certainly, based on some external data that I've seen, it does seem to say that we are gaining share as well. So we feel quite good about the momentum of iPhone.

And as you know, our services portfolio is very broad, and it contains businesses with very different margin profiles. The difference in margin profile is due in part to the nature of those businesses and in part to the way that we account for them; in some cases, we account on a net basis as opposed to a gross basis. And so as a result, the services gross margin percentage over time will be influenced by the relative growth of the different businesses within the portfolio. We do not guide at the product and services level, but I think you've seen the guidance that we provided for the March quarter at the total company level, 42.5% to 43.5%, obviously very strong compared to our recent history. And so we're very pleased with that.",

But generally, the challenge is on legacy nodes. And these legacy nodes are by supplier. And so it's much more focused on the supplier than anything else.

This success isn't limited to a specific region; it spans virtually all markets. Much of this is driven by M1, and we saw even greater interest with the MacBook Pro launched during the first quarter. We had a record number of upgraders in the December quarter, and in markets like China, six out of ten sales were from customers new to the Mac. This success is fueled by both upgraders and new users. Customer satisfaction is extremely high.

And so that's the kind of verbiage that we\u2019ve placed around it. In terms of is it still challenging? Yes, it is challenging. And for us, we pride ourselves on getting products to customers who really want them and try to do that at a fast pace. And so it's frustrating that we can't always do that at the speed that we would like. However, March is better than December. And so there's some encouraging sign there.

Some of them go change their name when they find an initiative that\u2019s attractive I feel. You folks are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in '21. So you're really spending a fair amount. And maybe without telling us the roadmap, could you just talk about how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on? And to some extent, is the way to think about this R&D spend, how much of it is really done on things that are more evolutionary in products that are out in the marketplace versus things that we haven't seen yet or on potential new offerings?",

In terms of deciding where we invest in, we look at areas that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And because we think that that's where the magic really happens and it brings out the best in Apple. And so there are areas that have more than peaked our interest, and we are investing in those.

And the active installed base of iPhone continues to grow and is now at an all-time high. And during December, as we had mentioned, we had a record number of upgraders and grew switchers strong double-digit, which I think speaks to the strength of the product. And that's all baked into an enormous customer satisfaction rating of 98% and doing well throughout the geographies. And I've mentioned some of the geos that we track and how many units we have on the top-selling model charts. And so even though this is the second product announcement that has 5G in it, we're still really in the early innings of 5G, meaning if you look at the installed base and look at how many people are on 5G versus not, and we don't release those exact numbers, but you can do some math and estimate those, we maintain a very optimistic view on iPhone long term.",

So we just obviously track all those metrics, and they're very important for us. And that's why we continue to improve the quality of our offerings and the quantity over time. As you've seen, we launched a lot of new services. We obviously care a lot about new customers as well, and that's why we keep track of the installed base and a lot of other metrics on that front. It's very similar to what we do with products. I mean, also for products, we care a lot about upgraders. We care a lot about switchers. It's obviously the combination of the 2 that when you put it together provides the level of growth that you've actually seen in our Services business. I mean the last 12 months, we've done over $72 billion of revenue on Services. It's the size of a Fortune 50 company. It couldn't happen with our contribution from both existing and new customers.",

Apple is proud to report another record quarter, with a March quarter revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% from a year ago and better than we anticipated. iPhone, Mac and Wearables, Home and Accessories had their best ever March quarter and Services set an all-time record on the strength of subscription growth over the past year. Before I get into details, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the humanitarian tragedy unfolding in Ukraine. We're continuing to do everything we can to support our teams in the region and we are donating to humanitarian efforts on the ground. We've also committed to donating products to support refugees arriving here in the United States. I also want to speak to the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. We are excited to be welcoming employees back to the offices in the US and Europe. At the same time, we are monitoring COVID-related disruptions in China. Our thoughts are with all those in the path of the virus and we remain as committed as ever to doing our part to help protect people and their communities. These times remind us that we cannot know what the future may hold. But they remind us too, that technology infused with humanity makes a real difference in the world. And that's where our focus has remained, on driving the innovations that can enrich people's lives. Throughout the quarter, Apple continued its streak of unparalleled innovation at an unmatched pace. With Apple Silicon our teams are pushing the limits of what we once thought possible and we are seeing leaps and bounds in performance and efficiency. Last month we announced another breakthrough with M1 Ultra, the world's most powerful chip for a personal computer. The incredible customer response to our M1-powered Macs helped propel a 15% year-over-year increase in revenue, despite supply constraints. We now have our most powerful Mac lineup ever, with the addition of the entirely new Mac Studio. Paired with the new studio display, a 5K resolution display equipped with its own A13 Bionic chip, this new desktop and display transform any workspace into a creative powerhouse. As we release the groundbreaking M1 Ultra, we also expanded our iPhone offerings adding two beautiful green finishes to the iPhone 13 lineup and introducing the new 5G-enabled iPhone SE, which is great for our existing users who want a smaller iPhone and a great value for people buying an iPhone for the first time. They love how much power and performance we've injected into such an affordable device and rave about its incredible camera and its lightning fast speeds. In the March quarter, iPhone revenue grew 5% over the previous year despite a challenging compare as we saw strong demand from our customers for the iPhone 13 family. And with the all-new iPad Air supercharged by M1, iPad brings more power and more versatility across the entire iPad lineup. For customers around the world, iPad continues to be essential for education, creativity and entertainment. That's why we're continuing to see such a strong demand for iPad even while navigating the significant supply constraint we predicted at the start of the quarter. Turning to Wearables Home and Accessories, we are pleased to see these products continue to delight our users growing 12% year-over-year. Customers are enthusiastically taking charge of their health with Apple Watch Series 7 and Apple Watch SE. The rich sound, beautiful colors and compact design of HomePod mini continue to make it a hit with customers. And there's still no better companion to Apple Music than AirPods with spatial audio that transforms the way we listen putting our customers right in the center of the music. The seamless integration of hardware software and services is at the center of our work and philosophy at Apple. Apple Services are designed to be easy to use with expert curation that brings our users compelling content from talented developers, creators, storytellers and artists. These principles are reflected in all of the services we've developed which continue to generate incredible enthusiasm from our customers. Services revenue rose to $19.8 billion in the March quarter reflecting a 17% increase from a year ago. We were especially excited to cheer on CODA as it won the Academy Award for Best Picture making Apple TV+ the first streaming service to win in this category. We were honored to be stewards of this incredibly powerful deeply moving film. In a little over two years Apple TV+ shows and movies have earned over 240 awards and more than 960 nominations from Severance to WeCrashed to Pachinko new Apple originals are connecting with audiences and earning praise from critics. We're also winning over sports fans with Friday Night Baseball, which debuted earlier this month and They Call Me Magic, a four-part documentary that premiered last week tracing the life of the iconic Magic Johnson. Fitness+ is helping users channel their inner athlete with a range of workout routines for any fitness level. We recently introduced a postpartum routine designed by mothers for mothers. And with our Apple heart and movement study, we are helping researchers glean new insights into cardiovascular fitness. As our products and services entertain customers and help them stay healthy, we're also working to make their lives easier. Arizona for example is the first state to enable its citizens to securely add their driver's license and state IDs to Apple Wallet. More states in the territory of Puerto Rico will soon follow. We've also announced plans to introduce Tap to Pay on iPhone a simple and secure way for businesses to accept contactless payments launching across the US later this year. To meet the needs of customers wherever they are, our Apple retail teams are constantly adapting to better serve them. We opened a new store in the United Arab Emirates this quarter at a unique waterfront location with panoramic views of the Abu Dhabi skyline. And earlier this month we opened a new store in Korea, our third and largest store in the heart of Seoul. And across the US we marked the return of in-person today at Apple Sessions with a special program featuring music from pop icon Lady Gaga. I'd like to thank our team members working in Apple stores, customer care centers, channel partner stores and our Apple Care teams for bringing customers the best of Apple. As we look to the environment, we are making good progress on our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality across our products and supply chain by 2030. Through our Green Bonds program, we're investing in breakthrough technologies like low-carbon aluminum which we will be integrating into the new iPhone SE. And we were pleased to announce recently that we've nearly doubled the number of our top suppliers who have committed to accelerating the transition to clean energy. We are also investing in renewable energy projects in communities most impacted by climate change around the world. As we do our part to protect our planet, we're also prioritizing people. As part of our long-standing commitment to inclusion and diversity, we're continuing to build a better, stronger Apple, rooted in a culture where everyone belongs. Last month we published an update on the progress we've made with inclusion and diversity at Apple. We've hired more women than ever into leadership roles. And in the US nearly 60% of all leadership openings were filled by people from underrepresented communities in 2021. We also recently announced a $50 million Supplier Employee Development Fund that will help workers in our supply chain discover additional educational opportunities and build new skills. And through our Racial Equity and Justice initiative, we're continuing to advance our work to support underrepresented communities and help build a more just and equitable world. Before I hand it over to Luca, I want to acknowledge the challenges we are seeing from supply chain disruptions driven by both COVID and silicon shortages to the devastation from the war in Ukraine. We are not immune to these challenges, but we have great confidence in our teams, in our products and services and in our strategy. Fundamentally our work is about making technology that enriches people's lives and unlocks the full creative potential of humanity. And though the twists and turns of the future may be uncertain what is certain is that we will never stop striving to be a force for good in the world in everything we do and everything we are. With that I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased to report very strong financial results for the March quarter during which we set a revenue record of $97.3 billion, up 9% year-over-year. We also set new March quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in Greater China. On the product side, revenue was $77.5 billion, up 7% over a year ago and a March quarter record. We grew in each of our product categories except iPad, which remains significantly supply constrained throughout the quarter. And we set March quarter records for iPhone, Mac and Wearables Home and Accessories. This level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer satisfaction and loyalty helped our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high for all major product categories as well as geographic segments. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17% over a year ago, with March quarter records in every geographic segment and services category. Company gross margin was 43.7%, down 10 basis points from last quarter. A seasonal loss of leverage and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by favorable mix. Products gross margin was 36.4%, down 200 basis points sequentially, mainly driven by seasonal loss of leverage and FX. Services gross margin was 72.6%, up 20 basis points sequentially due to a different mix. Operating cash flow of $28.2 billion, net income of $25 billion and diluted earnings per share of $1.52 were all March quarter records. These strong March quarter results capped a record first half of the fiscal year in the midst of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We generated over $220 billion in revenue growing 10% year-over-year and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables Home and Accessories and Services. These record sales results drove strong double-digit growth in operating income and earnings per share. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories during the March quarter. iPhone revenue grew 5% year-over-year to a March quarter record of $50.6 billion despite supply constraints. Thanks to our continued strong customer response to our iPhone 13 family and the launch of our new iPhone SE. We set March quarter records in both developed and emerging markets and the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 99% for the iPhone 13 family. As a result of this level of sales performance combined with unmatched customer loyalty, the iPhone active installed base reached a new all-time high across all geographies. For Mac, revenue of $10.4 billion was a March quarter record despite supply constraints with 15% year-over-year growth, driven by strong demand for our M1-powered MacBook Pro. As Tim mentioned earlier, our continued innovation and investment in Apple Silicon has clearly shown in our Mac results as the last seven quarters have been the best seven quarter ever for Mac. Our investment focus on Mac has also helped drive significant activity in our growing installed base. In fact, we had a March quarter record for upgraders, while at the same time, nearly half of the customers purchasing Mac were new to the product. iPad revenue was $7.6 billion, down 2% year-over-year due to continued supply constraints. Customer response to our iPad lineup including our new M1-powered iPad Air remains very strong and our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter, with over half of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter being new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories set a March quarter record of $8.8 billion, up 12% year-over-year. And we set March quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets. In particular, our Wearables business has doubled in three years and is mainly the size of a Fortune 100 business, as we continue to attract many customers who are new to Wearables. For instance, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. Turning to Services. As I mentioned we reached an all-time revenue record of $19.8 billion, up 17%, with all-time records for the App Store, Music, Cloud Services and Apple Care and March quarter records for video, advertising and payment services. These impressive results reflect the impact of our continued investment in improving and expanding our Services portfolio and the positive momentum that we're seeing on many fronts. First, our installed base has continued to grow, reaching an all-time high across each geographic segment and major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Our transacting accounts, paid accounts and accounts with paid subscriptions, all reached all-time highs during the March quarter in every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continued to show very strong growth. We now have more than 825 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, which is up more than 165 million during the last 12 months alone. And finally, as Tim highlighted before, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current service offerings while launching new services. In the enterprise market, many businesses and government organizations continue to turn to Apple for the latest technologies, to deliver innovative services to customers and employees. In March, Alaska Airlines began to replace the conventional airport self-service kiosks with iPad Pros for faster passenger check-in and self bag drop. Also, last month, the Western Australia Police Force completed the world's first commercial deployment of CarPlay across their entire fleet of vehicles, to complement the iPhone 13 issued to each officer. This allows officers to access critical information faster on the road and enhance public safety for the community. We also unveiled the general availability of Apple Business Essentials in the US, adding a new subscription services designed to help small businesses manage every aspect of their Apple device life cycle. Let me now turn to our cash position. As we continue to generate very strong cash flow, we ended the quarter with $193 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.8 billion in maturing debt, while increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $73 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders during the March quarter. This included $3.6 billion in dividends and equivalents and $22.9 billion through open market repurchases of 137 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 5 million shares in the final settlement of our 18th ASR. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 5% to $0.23 a share and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near-term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We believe our year-over-year revenue performance during the June quarter will be impacted by a number of factors. Supply constraints caused by COVID-related disruptions and industry-wide silicon shortages are impacting our ability to meet customer demand for our products. We expect these constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion which is substantially larger than what we experienced during the March quarter. The COVID-related disruptions are also having some impact on customer demand in China. With respect to foreign exchange, we expect it to be a nearly 300 basis point headwind to our year-over-year growth rate. Additionally, we paused all sales in Russia during the March quarter. This will impact our year-over-year growth rate by approximately 150 basis points. Specifically related to Services, we expect to continue to grow double-digits, but decelerate from our March quarter performance due to some of the factors I just described. We expect gross margin to be between 42% and 43%. We expect OpEx to be between $12.7 billion and $12.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on May 12th 2022 to shareholders of record as of May 9th, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

They were significantly lower than what we had experienced during the December quarter. They were driven by industry-wide silicon shortages. And specifically, the issue that I talked about on previous calls with the legacy nodes. But looking ahead, we see two causes of supply constraints. One is the COVID-related disruptions; and there's the industry-wide silicon shortages that will continue. We've estimated the constraints to be in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion. And if you \u2013 these constraints are primarily centered around the Shanghai corridor. And the \u2013 on a positive front, almost all of the affected final assembly factories have now restarted. And so the range \u2013 the $4 billion to $8 billion range reflects various ramps of getting back up and running. We're also encouraged that the COVID case count that's been reported in Shanghai has decreased over the last few days. And so there's \u2013 there's some reason for optimism there.",

First of all I was hoping you just touched a little bit on the geographic growth vectors that you saw. And I think Americas grew really well 19%, 20%. But Europe and China had much more muted growth if you may. I know your compares are fairly difficult but I'm curious if anything you would call out in terms of spillover effect on the macro side from Russia, Ukraine in Europe that's seeing some impact to consumer spend or even in China. Just help us understand what happened geographically there.",

We grew 5% in spite of the fact that of course as you know during the month of March, we paused our sales in Russia. So we had an impact to our sales results there for a month of the quarter. But a number of European countries particularly in Western Europe did really-really well for us. And so it was a very good quarter for us pretty much in line with our expectations. Americas was better than our expectations. China was again a March quarter record for us. Keep in mind and this affected every geographic segment for us the different launch timing for the iPhone this year versus a year ago had an impact on the March quarter results because we launched the product later a year ago than we did this year. So some of the channel fill for the new products happened during the March quarter a year ago. Japan and Asia Pacific were affected by foreign exchange. Japan would have grown in line with company average in constant currency terms. Asia Pacific as well was affected by foreign exchange with the dollar appreciating against most currencies. And then again this difference in the launch timing for the iPhone made a difference. Keep in mind again the supply constraints that we had during the quarter our results would have been obviously better without the supply constraints. Overall we felt very good about the performance around the world.",

When we hopefully someday get past all of these and the supply constraints in society and turmoil hopefully across the world, do you start to reconsider the way you do the supply chain albeit just-in-time ordering and outsourcing so much of your chips? Or do you actually consider like holding more buffer inventory internally, because right now letting $4 billion to $8 billion go away it'd be nice to have that to be able to sell. So do you consider holding more buffer inventory or maybe even doing your own chips by outsourcing your own chips to control them more, or how should we think about strategically when hopefully the world is in a better place from today?",

Our supply chain operates on a global scale with products manufactured in various locations, including a significant amount in the U.S. We anticipate increasing our production here as more chips are made domestically. We're continuously optimizing our processes and adapting based on what we learn each day. When we take a step back and evaluate the supply chain within the challenging environment you've described, I believe it has proven to be very resilient. The primary challenge we face is the silicon shortage that everyone is experiencing. We've managed well through the difficulties presented by COVID. As we gather insights, we make adjustments accordingly; our approach is flexible. In this industry, it's crucial not to maintain excessive inventory, so we focus on minimizing cycle times and strategically managing our inventory to buffer against potential disruptions. We're always assessing those needs. Currently, it's not feasible for us to hold back silicon. Therefore, once silicon is produced, it moves quickly to final assembly, and we aim to keep that time frame as brief as possible.",

Looking at the numbers, our run rate is nearly $20 billion, which is essentially double what it was four years ago. We've seen significant success in Services, driven by several factors. First, our installed base of active devices continues to grow nicely, serving as a major engine for our Services business. Second, engagement levels on our platform are increasing, with more transacting and paying accounts, as well as subscriptions. We now have 825 million paid subscriptions on our platform, which is an impressive increase of 165 million in just the last year. This clearly indicates strong growth. Over the last few years, we've added many new services and plan to continue doing so, which we believe our customers will appreciate. We see great momentum overall.  Growth rates may fluctuate, especially during COVID with the cycles of lockdowns and reopenings, which could make comparisons a bit misleading. Our focus remains on satisfying our customers, expanding our offerings, and enhancing service quality, which has proven effective. In the past year, we've generated $75 billion in Services revenue, with margins positively contributing to overall company margins. We are optimistic about the Services business. I noted earlier that the growth rate for the June quarter is expected to be lower than the 17% reported in March, due to the reasons mentioned. The strong dollar and the pause in sales in Russia are also factors to consider.

And you also spoke about a $4 billion to $8 billion supply constraint which is a large amount compared to the revenue. And I understand you have the supply constraints and the China shutdowns.

However, to reiterate what I mentioned earlier, we are facing supply constraints due to COVID-related disruptions and silicon shortages. These issues are expected to impact revenue in the range of $4 billion to $8 billion, which is significantly higher than what we experienced in the March quarter. It's important to note that the COVID-related challenges did not affect the March quarter. Regarding foreign exchange, we anticipate a nearly 300 basis points headwind, compared to about 200 basis points in the March quarter. The impact from Russia on a year-over-year basis is approximately 150 basis points, reflecting three months of the quarter since we paused sales there at the beginning of March, resulting in a partial impact on the March quarter. Sequentially, this adds an incremental factor to consider. On a positive note, demand for our products and services remains robust. The iPhone 13 family, in particular, has had an excellent year, with our analysis showing that the top-selling smartphones globally during the March quarter were primarily iPhones. In the U.S., the top six models are iPhones, while in Japan, they occupy the top four spots. In Australia, five of the top six are iPhones, and the same is true for urban China. The iPhone 13 has indeed been a global success. Additionally, many iPad and Mac models are currently constrained due to high demand, and our Services business continues to grow at double-digit rates.

Today, Apple is reporting another record June quarter with revenue of $83 billion, which was better than we expected despite supply constraints, strong foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of our business in Russia. We set June quarter records in the Americas, in Europe and in the rest of Asia Pacific region. We also saw June quarter revenue records in both developed and emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Indonesia and Vietnam and a near doubling of revenue in India. We saw great enthusiasm for our products and services, resulting in an all-time record for our installed base of active devices. Our supply constraints were less than we anticipated at the beginning of the quarter, coming in slightly below the range we discussed during our last call. We know that this is a time of significant challenge around the world for all of us confronting new variants of COVID-19, to those experiencing a prolonged humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and everyone dealing with the consequences of an uncertain economic environment. We know that much of the world is living through uneasy times, and it is all the more reason why we are working hard to help our customers navigate the world as it is while empowering them to create the world as it can be. Turning to iPhone. We set a June quarter record for both revenue and switchers to iPhone. With its advanced performance, capability and ease of use, customers continue to find that iPhone remains the gold standard for smartphones. And they've been raving about the iPhone 13 lineup's extraordinary camera quality with features like cinematic mode and macro photography to create eye-catching content. We were also proud to celebrate the 15th anniversary of iPhone, a device that continues to change the world in profound ways with each new innovation. Last month, Apple unleashed a wave of innovation, including the completely redesigned MacBook Air and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro. Both of these systems are powered by M2, our next generation of Apple silicon for Mac. M2 delivers a faster CPU, GPU and neural engine along with higher memory bandwidth and new capabilities like Pro Res acceleration. And it continues the tremendous pace of innovation in Apple silicon for the Mac. We continue to have supply constraints with Mac, but we're encouraged by the strong response from customers to our incredible lineup. iPad, like Mac, continued to see strong demand during the June quarter despite ongoing supply constraints. Customers and developers have been especially excited about the new features we're bringing to iPad with iPadOS 16. This update was one of the many announcements we made at a truly extraordinary WWDC, where we shared a range of new features that give customers more control of their experience than ever before. This includes the ability to edit or delete sent messages, a new way of organizing apps on iPad and Mac, and an all-new customizable lock screen on iPhone and so much more. Today, iOS 16, iPadOS 16, MacOS Ventura and watchOS 9 are all in public beta, and we couldn't be more excited to see what our community of developers creates with them. We unveiled new innovations and accessibility such as door detection and live captions that support users with disabilities with navigation, health, communication and more. We also announced Apple Pay Later, which gives customers more flexibility to make purchases with their Apple devices. And with our next generation of CarPlay, we're improving the driving experience with deeper integration into vehicle hardware, allowing drivers to control their music, change the temperature and monitor their fuel levels, all from a single integrated platform. In the Wearables, Home and Accessories category, the innovation infused across our products continues to win over new customers. Apple Watch remains a great way for health-conscious customers to track their overall wellness and fitness. And we're bringing them even more data about their workouts, sleep cycles and medications with updates soon to arrive on watchOS 9. We were also pleased to get FDA approval for a new feature that will let users with irregular heart rhythms track the time they spend in Afib. Turning to Services. Customers continue to engage enthusiastically with our content across news, fitness, music, gaming and more. Services revenue rose to $19.6 billion, a June quarter record and a 12% increase year-over-year, which was in line with our expectations. We're proud of how Apple TV+ productions like Severance and Black Bird have captured the popular imagination, and we're looking forward to more exceptional content developed by extraordinary creators throughout the year. In 2.5 years since launch, Apple TV+ has now earned 250 wins and over 1,100 award nominations and counting. Just this month, we learned that Apple TV+ earned 52 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles. In our last call, I mentioned Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+, which is already delighting baseball fans. And last month, we announced a 10-year deal to present Major League soccer matches around the world, giving global soccer fans a whole new way of viewing their favorite sport. One of the best parts of WWDC was welcoming developers to Apple Park while continuing to connect with developers all over the world. This year, we had an incredible group of developers and more opportunities to learn from one another than ever before. It was a truly special experience and a reminder of the economic miracle the App Store represents. We are proud of the fact that the iOS app economy supports more than 2.2 million jobs here in the United States and many more around the world. It's been wonderful to see earnings by small developers more than double over the past 2 years. And as we're supporting developers, we're also doing our part to protect customers. In 2021, we prevented nearly $1.5 billion in fraudulent transactions by stopping over 1.6 million risky and vulnerable apps and app updates. Now I want to turn to retail. This quarter, we opened the doors to Apple's first store in the Hubei province in China, welcoming the community to a beautiful new space. And earlier today, we opened Apple Brompton Road, our fifth store in Central London. We also expanded today at Apple Creative Studios to reach even more young creatives from underrepresented communities to help them realize their potential and bring their best ideas to life. I'd like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation to our team members working in Apple Stores, customer care centers and channel partner stores and to our Apple Care teams for their incredible work supporting customers wherever they are. Creating innovative products and services that enrich people's lives is our mission. Leading with our values and everything we do gives that mission purpose. That includes a commitment to the environment where we continue our aggressive pursuit of our 2030 goals. It includes our focus on diversity and inclusion, where we are committed as ever to making progress. And it includes our work to promote racial equity and justice. We recently announced that the Global Equity Innovation Hub, in partnership with Cal State Northridge, will provide new community grants to Hispanic-serving institutions to help the next generation of creators and innovators build skills and pursue high-demand careers in STEM. We also celebrated the graduation of the inaugural class of our Developer Academy in Detroit from a program designed to give students the skills they need to pursue jobs in the thriving iOS app economy. Leading with our values also means leading with a steadfast commitment to privacy and security. Last month, we announced the introduction of passkey, a next-generation credential that's intended to replace passwords. A passkey can't be phished nor can it be stolen by hackers in a data breach because the information is stored on your device and your device alone. And as part of our effort to combat targeted attacks against the highest risk targets like journalists and human rights activists, we introduced Lockdown Mode, which is designed to protect those most at risk of sophisticated digital attacks. And we're committed to doing our part to address the housing crisis across California. To date, we have deployed more than $1.3 billion to a number of initiatives, including ones that provide financial assistance to low and moderate income first-time home buyers develop new affordable housing and help support vulnerable populations. This quarter has ultimately been a reflection of our resilience and our optimism. As we look forward, we're clear-eyed about the uncertainty in the macro environment. Yet we remain ever focused on the same vision that has guided us from the beginning. We strive every day to be a place where imagination ignites innovation like nowhere else, where good people come together to achieve great things, where customers are the center of everything we do. And we'll continue to execute on that vision as we always have, led by a focus on excellence and a desire to leave the world better than we found it. And with that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report our financial results for the June quarter, showcasing our ability to innovate across hardware, software, and services while managing our business effectively under challenging economic conditions. We achieved a record revenue of $83 billion for the June quarter, which is a 2% increase year-over-year, despite facing supply constraints, significant foreign exchange challenges, and the effects of our operations in Russia. We set new records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific.  On the product side, we recorded revenue of $63.4 billion, with a new June quarter record for iPhone sales. Throughout the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow due to exceptional customer satisfaction and loyalty, reaching all-time highs across key product categories and regions. Our Services segment achieved a revenue record of $19.6 billion, marking a 12% rise from a year ago, with all-time highs in the Americas and the rest of Asia Pacific, alongside new records in Europe and Greater China. We also set revenue records in each major Services category, including Music, Cloud Services, Apple Care, and Payment Services.  Our gross margin was 43.3%, a decrease of 40 basis points from last quarter due to seasonal leverage losses and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, although this was partially offset by a favorable product mix. The gross margin for Products was 34.5%, down 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to seasonal leverage losses, product mix changes, and foreign exchange factors. The Services gross margin was 71.5%, down 110 basis points sequentially, influenced by mix and foreign exchange considerations. Our net income reached $19.4 billion, with diluted earnings per share at $1.20, while operating cash flow totaled $22.9 billion, achieving a record for the June quarter.  Now, let's delve into the specifics of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue rose by 3% year-over-year, hitting a June quarter record of $40.7 billion, despite foreign exchange headwinds, thanks to strong customer interest in the iPhone 13 family. We set records in both developed and emerging markets, leading to an all-time high for the iPhone active installed base across all areas, driven by high sales performance and unparalleled customer loyalty. Recent surveys in the U.S. show iPhone customer satisfaction at 98%. We also attracted a record number of switchers during the June quarter, demonstrating strong double-digit growth. For Mac, we earned $7.4 billion in revenue despite facing supply issues and adverse effects. We are enthusiastic about our long-term potential in redefining the PC experience through ongoing innovation. Our dedicated efforts towards the Mac have significantly increased our installed base, which reached an all-time high during the June quarter, with nearly half of Mac purchasers being first-time buyers. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, reflecting a 2% year-over-year decline due to supply constraints and negative foreign exchange impacts. Customer feedback for our iPad lineup remains strong across consumer, education, and enterprise markets globally. Consequently, the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of the purchasers being new to the product during the quarter. Revenue from Wearables, Home, and Accessories was $8.1 billion, an 8% year-over-year decrease influenced by foreign exchange challenges, varied launch timings for products, supply constraints, and the overarching macroeconomic climate. Nevertheless, our installed base in this category set a new all-time record, fueled by robust customer loyalty and high new user rates. For instance, over two-thirds of Apple Watch purchasers during the quarter were new customers. In Services, we achieved a record revenue of $19.6 billion for the June quarter, increasing by 12% despite nearly 500 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds, along with challenges stemming from our operations in Russia and the broader economic environment. We established revenue records in both developed and emerging markets and set all-time highs in various countries, including the U.S., Mexico, Brazil, Korea, and India. The outstanding performance of our Services portfolio during the June quarter highlights the strength of our ecosystem in many respects.  Our installed base continues to grow, achieving all-time highs across each geographic segment and major product category. Customer engagement with our Services also increased, with double-digit growth in transacting accounts, paid accounts, and accounts with paid subscriptions. Paid subscriptions have shown significant growth, with over 860 million subscriptions now on our platform, an increase of more than 160 million over the past year. We also continue to enhance both the breadth and quality of our Services offerings, providing new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, along with exciting new features for iCloud and Apple Music that we believe will resonate with our customers. In the enterprise sector, customers are increasingly investing in Apple products as a strategy for talent attraction and retention. For example, Bank of America is supplying iPhones to all financial advisers for instant client information access and timely wealth management advice. Wipro is investing in MacBook Air with M1 as an advantage in recruiting new graduates, benefiting from its superior performance and lower total ownership costs. With the introduction of the M2 chip in both the MacBook Air and the 13-inch MacBook Pro, we anticipate more companies providing Macs to their workforce. Now, regarding our financial position, we concluded the quarter with $179 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3 billion in maturing debt while increasing our commercial paper by $4 billion, resulting in total debt of $120 billion. Consequently, our net cash stood at nearly $60 billion at quarter\u2019s end. During the June quarter, we returned over $28 billion to shareholders, which included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $21.7 billion through open market repurchases of 143 million shares. We firmly believe in the value of our stock and aim to achieve a net cash neutral position over time. Looking forward to the September quarter, we will not provide specific revenue guidance due to ongoing uncertainty. However, we are offering directional insights based on current macroeconomic expectations and COVID-related impacts not worsening. Generally, we expect our year-over-year revenue growth to increase in the September quarter compared to the June quarter, even with an estimated 600 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange. On the product side, we anticipate lower supply constraints than we experienced in the June quarter. For Services, we predict revenue to grow but decelerate from the June quarter, influenced by macroeconomic factors and foreign exchange. Our gross margin is expected to fall between 41.5% and 42.5%, with operating expenses anticipated to be between $12.9 billion and $13.1 billion. We expect interest and other expenses to reflect a negative impact from minority investments' mark-to-market adjustments, with a tax rate around 16%. Lastly, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on August 11, 2022, to shareholders of record as of August 8, 2022. Now, let's open the floor to questions.",

On a sequential basis, the decline is expected to be driven by, as you mentioned, foreign exchange but also mix, which will be partially offset by better leverage. We expect foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis to be 50 basis points. If you look at it from a year-over-year standpoint, we are in the ballpark of a year ago in spite of the fact that foreign exchange is going to be 130 basis points negative to a year ago.

For the iPhone, there wasn't much evidence of macroeconomic influence aside from foreign exchange. The Mac and iPad were constrained by supply, which limited our ability to gauge demand. In the Wearables, Home, and Accessories category, we did notice some impact from the broader economic environment. In terms of Services, certain areas, like digital advertising, were also affected by the macroeconomic situation. Overall, it\u2019s a mixed picture, but we\u2019re pleased with our results.

But I think the way to think about it, certainly the way we think about it is that there's a number of levers in our Services business to take into account. The first one is installed base. Installed base is the engine for our company and it continues to grow. As I mentioned, it has reached an all-time high across every geographic segment, across every product category. And so that's very important. Then the second lever is the customer engagement. And we know that our customers are getting more and more engaged over time. Transacting accounts, paid accounts, paid subscriptions are growing, so the level of engagement continues to grow. And then as you mentioned, the breadth and the quality of the services that we offer tends to grow over time. So these are all things that tend to help us over the long term. If you go back and you look at our growth rates over a number of quarters now, they've always been very good. Of course, the macro environment can have an impact on this business. Tim has mentioned, for example, digital advertising can be affected at times. During COVID, some of the compares have been a bit lumpy because there have been lockdowns and reopenings and so on. So it's very difficult to talk about a steady state growth rate for our Services business. But when we look at the entirety of what we are doing in the Services space, we feel very good about the future of the business.",

And we continue to execute across some significant geographies where there's a very low penetration of iPhone. Some of those were called out in the opening remarks between Indonesia and Vietnam and India, where we did quite well, and iPhone tends to be the engine for those markets, particularly at the beginning of creating the market there for Apple products. And so we're really looking at all of these things from the installed base to the number of switchers to the geographic distribution. Of course, the most important thing for us is to maintain an incredible customer satisfaction and loyalty from the customers. And we're really pleased that it's currently at 98% for the latest iPhones. And so those are the things that underpin it. 5G has been an accelerant. And the 5G penetration, particularly if you look at it globally, is still quite low. In some geographies, it's obviously higher, but around the world, 5G penetration is still low.

Incredibly important in terms of reducing the affordability threshold. And trading programs. Trading programs are available in a number of markets. We can do better in other markets. They're incredibly important because the residual value of our products is a huge differentiator for our users.

Can you provide insight into how the overall market is affecting the Mac business compared to the supply chain issues? It seems that the business is nearly entirely constrained by supply chain factors, but we are noticing anecdotal and some measurable evidence that the broader PC market is slowing down. About 90 days ago, you expressed confidence that with the new M2 chip, you could sustain growth despite potential market downturns. Do you still hold that view? Additionally, could you explain your perspective on the various components of your growth in relation to the market?",

However, in the last quarter, we experienced significant challenges when COVID restrictions affected the Shanghai corridor, severely impacting our supply of Mac units, which operated at reduced capacity or were completely halted for most of the quarter. This had a considerable effect on the Mac business. By the end of the quarter, we managed to reduce our losses to 10 points, which I would attribute largely to supply issues. Additionally, foreign exchange factors contributed due to global translation issues, and there were also impacts from the business in Russia. These three factors are the main reasons for our situation. Regarding demand testing, it's challenging to evaluate demand without sufficient supply, and last quarter we were not close to meeting that supply, so our demand estimates are just that\u2014estimates. We are aware of the industry's trends and are optimistic about our Mac products, especially with the M1 and M2 chips. We have a robust offering for the back-to-school season, and we will assess our performance this quarter, with an update in October.",

Additionally, a smaller contributing factor has been the ongoing silicon shortage that has impacted our results for several quarters. Looking ahead, we are not able to predict when the silicon shortage will end, but we believe that our constraint numbers for the September quarter will be better than those in June.

That's a big number right there that is going to affect us, that we are having some impact from the situation in Russia and that is obviously different from normal seasonality as well. Our supply constraints, as Tim just said, are going to be lower than what we've seen in the June quarter but they're still going to be there.

For instance, in the same quarter last year, we launched AirTag, which did not have a comparable announcement this year. Beyond these four factors, we also believe there was a negative impact from the macroeconomic environment.

Over the past year, despite a range of challenges facing the world, our teams have come together in incredible ways to drive unparalleled innovation and deliver again and again for our customers. For the September quarter, we reported record revenue of $90.1 billion, which was better than we anticipated despite stronger-than-expected foreign currency headwinds. We set an all-time revenue record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Services notched a September quarter record as well with revenue of $19.2 billion and more than 900 million paid subscriptions. We reached another record on our installed base of active devices, thanks to a quarterly record of upgraders and double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone. Across nearly every geographic segment, we reached a new revenue record for the quarter. And we continue to perform incredibly well in emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. I'm also happy to report that during the quarter, silicon-related supply constraints were not significant. I want to acknowledge that we are still living through unprecedented times. From war in Eastern Europe to the persistence of COVID-19, from climate disasters around the world to an increasingly difficult economic environment, many people and places are struggling. Through it all, we've aimed to help our customers navigate through the challenges while giving them the tools to drive progress for themselves and their communities. At Apple, creativity and collaboration have always been at the core of who we are. That spirit of ingenuity and teamwork helped us provide our customers with incredible innovations this year and led to another yearly revenue record. In fiscal 2022, Apple achieved revenue of $394 billion, representing 8% annual growth. We set records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services while growing double digits in emerging markets and setting records in the vast majority of markets we track. Customers are loving our iPhone 14 lineup. Loaded with camera upgrades for sharper photos, Action Mode for smoother videos and new safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite, iPhone is even more indispensable to our daily lives. iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with a new dual-camera system, industry-leading durability, incredible power and amazing battery life. And our iPhone 14 Pro models are packed with even more groundbreaking innovations, including a new camera system as well as always-on display and the Dynamic Island, which offers a whole new way to interact with iPhone. Just yesterday, our most advanced iPad and iPad Pro ever landed in stores. With its all-screen design, advanced cameras and faster wireless connectivity, the tenth generation iPad looks and performs better than ever. For creatives, iPad Pro, now turbocharged by the blazingly fast M2 chip, is the perfect device to make something amazing. Our Mac customers have already been raving about the power of M2 since the arrival of our newest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro this summer. Their incredible long battery life, stunningly rich display and lightning fast speeds are a signature part of the Mac experience and helped drive an all-time record revenue for Mac during the September quarter. In Wearables, Home and Accessories a wave of innovation spurred 10% year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. New features in Apple Watch Series 8, including temperature sensing capabilities, retrospective ovulation estimates and crash detection are helping to keep customers healthier and safer. And the updated Apple Watch SE is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, delivering advanced features at a new low price. The biggest, brightest and boldest Apple Watch ever made, Apple Watch Ultra pushes the boundaries of what a smartwatch can do. Packed with innovations like advanced navigation tools and the new Oceanic+ app, which turns it into a dive computer, Apple Watch Ultra has something for athletes and adventurers on land and sea. The second generation of AirPods Pro powered by the new H2 chip are receiving rave reviews for delivering an unmatched wireless earbud audio experience while canceling up to twice as much noise over the previous model. There's no better place to discover the rich spatial audio capabilities of AirPods Pro than Apple Music, the largest music catalog anywhere now with more than 100 million songs. And there's no other company that fuses best-in-class hardware with cutting-edge software and services to create a truly integrated and seamless experience. With iOS 16, we're giving customers more ways to personalize their iPhones through a customizable lock screen and focus filters. New features in Messages and Mail enable users to connect and collaborate like never before. Stage Manager in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura helps users stay more productive with smoother multitasking. And watchOS 9 is empowering customers to live a healthier day through updates to the Sleep App, a new FDA-cleared AFib history feature and the new Medications app. Across our Services, we continue to see enthusiasm and strong engagement from our subscribers. Apple TV+ hits like Severance, Bad Sisters and Blackbird have taken center stage on screens around the world. And baseball fans were glued to their seats this season watching Friday Night Baseball. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ productions continue to earn accolades. At the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards in September, Apple brought home 9 statues, including a second consecutive win for Best Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. And soon, we're going to give audiences an even better entertainment experience when the all-new Apple TV 4K hits stores next week. We're also bringing Fitness+ to more customers than ever by making our entire library of over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations available to iPhone users in 21 countries, even those without an Apple Watch. These updates are arriving just in time for a new Artist Spotlight series with workouts featuring the music of Taylor Swift and a new workout program, Yoga for Every Runner featuring and designed with one of the world's top ultramarathon athletes, Scott Jurek. While Fitness+ helps subscribers stay active, Apple Card is designed with our customers' financial health in mind. For the second year in a row, Apple Card has been ranked highest in customer satisfaction for midsized credit card issuers by J.D. Power. And our users' favorite Apple Card benefit just got even better with the upcoming addition of a new high-yield savings account to help them save and grow their daily cash rewards. Turning to retail. Last month, our team members welcomed customers to the all-new Apple Jamsil in South Korea. And through Today at Apple Creative Studios, we partnered with non-profits in cities around the world to help young diverse creatives pursue their passions and connect with local mentors. Our retail teams have done exceptional work, helping customers explore our latest products and features. As we approach the holiday season with our product lineup set, I'd like to share my gratitude to our retail, AppleCare and channel teams for the work they are doing to support customers. At Apple, we're proud of the ways we are able to help customers be productive, get healthy, stay safe and unlock their creative potential. We also understand we have important responsibilities to the communities we serve. That's why we continue to invest in education, racial equity and justice and the environment. And we are making important progress toward a more inclusive and diverse workforce. Through our Community Education Initiative, we're working alongside more than 150 partners to help students around the world learn new science and technology skills. This summer, we joined with community partners to support coding academies across the United States from Code Academy in Nashville to One Summer Chicago to the Coding 5K Camp for Girls right next door in San Jose. We've also just expanded our racial equity and justice initiative into the UK for the first time. Alongside the South Pink Center, we're helping aspiring creators develop their own voices and position themselves for long-lasting careers. Back in the US, we welcomed a new class of Black, Latino and indigenous entrepreneurs to Apple's second Impact Accelerator. This group of innovators is focused on using green technology to mitigate the effects of climate change and serve communities most affected by it. At Apple, we care deeply about protecting the planet for future generations. To that end, in support of our 2030 environmental goals, we have asked all of our suppliers to become carbon-neutral across their entire Apple-related footprint by the end of the decade. We are also providing them with resources based on what we learned achieving net-zero carbon in our own global operations. Across our entire product lineup, we also continue to source more materials through recycling while taking less from the Earth. Every iPhone 14 is made with 100% recycled rare-earth elements in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe. And in a first for Apple Watch and iPad, we're using recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards in our newest devices. While we're working to reduce the footprint of our hardware, we're making changes to our software to be more environmentally friendly with the soon-to-be-released Clean Energy charging feature for iPhone. Our 2030 goal is a reflection of our relentless focus on the future at Apple. The world continues to be unpredictable as old challenges evolve and new ones emerge. What remains constant is the ability of our teams to create great products, services and experiences while being a force for good in the world. Whatever challenges lie ahead in the new year, we're moving forward, as we always have, investing for the long-term to deliver incredible innovations for our customers like only Apple can. And now, I'll hand it over to Luca for more details on our performance.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the September quarter that capped another record fiscal year for Apple despite a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop. We reached a September quarter revenue record of $90.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year despite over 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, with new September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Importantly, in constant currency, we grew nicely in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit growth outside the US. Products revenue was $71 billion, up 9% over last year despite FX headwinds and a record for the September quarter. It was a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories and an all-time revenue record for Mac. Overall, our installed base of active devices continues to grow nicely. It reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments at the end of the quarter, thanks to extremely strong customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers that are new to our products. Our Services set a September quarter revenue record of $19.2 billion, up 5% over a year ago despite over 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific and also in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services and payment services. Company gross margin was a September quarter record at 42.3%. It was down 100 basis points from last quarter due to unfavorable foreign exchange and a different mix, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially, with improved leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.5%, down 100 basis points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange. Net income of $20.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.29 and operating cash flow of $24.1 billion were all September quarter records. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 10% year-over-year to a September quarter record of $42.6 billion, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We set September quarter records in the vast majority of markets we track, and our performance was particularly impressive in several large emerging markets, with India setting a new all-time revenue record and Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico more than doubling year-over-year. Thanks to our strong iPhone lineup, we set a quarterly record for upgraders and grew switchers double digits. This level of sales performance, along with unmatched customer loyalty, drove the active installed base of iPhones to a new all-time high across all geographic segments. The latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%. It was a great quarter for Mac. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year, despite significant FX headwinds. Three key items helped drive this performance. First, we benefited from the launch of our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip. Second, we were able to satisfy pent-up demand that carried forward from the significant supply constraints we faced during the June quarter. Third, as our supply position improved, we were able to fill the channel. Importantly, our investment in the category has attracted both upgraders and customers new to Mac and helped our installed base reach an all-time high. In fact, we set a quarterly record for upgraders, while nearly half of customers buying Macs during the quarter were new to the device. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to significant negative foreign exchange and a challenging compare due to the launch of new iPads a year ago. Despite this, the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. Over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.7 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, driven by the launch of Apple Watch and new AirPods Pro. This level of performance along with very strong new user rates drove our installed base of devices in the category to a new all-time record. For instance, two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, as I mentioned, we set a September quarter record in aggregate and in most geographic segments, generating $19.2 billion in revenue in spite of very large foreign exchange headwinds. It is important to remember, that we achieved double-digit constant currency growth in Services on top of growing 26% during the September quarter a year ago. However, certain services were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign exchange. Digital advertising and gaming are areas where we've seen some softness. Throughout the quarter, we continued to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem and our long-term opportunity in the category. First, our continued installed base growth across each geographic segment and each major product category represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. The percentage of accounts that pay for our services continues to increase, and we see plenty of opportunity ahead of us. Third, paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 900 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up more than 155 million during the last 12 months alone and double what we had just three years ago. We continue investing in new content and features across our service offerings. For example, we added several popular sports titles to Apple Arcade. We're also excited about our global partnership with Major League Soccer, where starting next season, fans can stream every MLS match through the Apple TV app. This momentum helped us achieve over $78 billion in Services revenue during fiscal 2022, a new record and up 14% year-over-year. We continue to invest confidently and believe strongly in the long-term potential of our Services business, which is already the size of a Fortune 50 business on its own and has nearly doubled during the last four years. It was not only a record year for Services but also for our entire company. During the past four quarters, we grew our business by 8% or $29 billion, reaching more than $394 billion of revenue. We grew diluted earnings per share by 9% and generated over $111 billion of free cash flow, up 20% year-over-year. It was also a strong year for our enterprise business, as we set new annual records for iPhone, iPad and Mac during fiscal 2022 and grew strong double digits year-over-year as our devices and services continue to help more and more companies empower their employees and serve their customers. For instance, Ford Manufacturing employees are using iPad and iPhone to help further improve the quality of its game-changing Ford F-150 Lightning electric trucks. iPhone's powerful A-series chip and advanced camera systems, along with third-party iOS apps, are enabling Ford to automate the visual quality inspection process in real-time to help address issues before they impact customers. Cisco expanded its Macs as a choice program and is now offering it to all its employees to help attract and retain top talent. When given this choice, employees have chosen Macs twice as often as other options. Many enterprise customers are taking advantage of the high residual value of our products and simple trade-in process to standardize the refresh cycles for their fleets of Apple devices. This allows employees to upgrade to the latest devices regularly while making it highly predictable and cost effective for the business. Let me now turn to our cash position. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, which enabled us to return over $29 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25.2 billion through open market repurchases of 160 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $169 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.8 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $1 billion while issuing $5.5 billion of new debt, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $49 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Overall, we believe total company year-over-year revenue performance will decelerate during the December quarter as compared to the September quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect nearly 10 percentage points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange. Second, on Mac, in addition to increasing FX headwinds, we have a very challenging compare against last year, which had the benefit of the launch and associated channel fill of our newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1. Therefore, we expect Mac revenue to decline substantially year-over-year during the December quarter. Specifically on Services, we expect to grow but to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment increasingly affecting foreign exchange, digital advertising and gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2022. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

On the positive side, you've raised prices. It seems to be mixing up. On the negative side, investors are concerned about impacted demand from the higher prices, what Huawei meant to you in prior years versus what could happen now. There are just some pressures out there. So I'm curious if you can kind of talk to what you're seeing initially in iPhone demand and how you think it will move through.

It's important to note that this follows a fiscal year in 2021 where iPhone revenue increased by 39%, making it a tough comparison. We were pleased with this performance. Regarding the new products, the iPhone 14 and 14 Pro and Pro Max, it's still early to draw conclusions. However, we have been facing constraints on the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max since their launch, and we continue to experience those constraints. We're making significant efforts to meet the demand. The actual product mix remains uncertain until we can fully satisfy that demand. Despite this, we were very happy with the widespread strength of the iPhone last quarter. We had three of the top four smartphones in the U.S. and the UK, the top three in Urban China, the top six in Australia, four out of the top five in Germany, and the top two in Japan. Customer satisfaction for the iPhone is very high at 98%. Overall, we feel good about our performance in Q4. The start of this generation indicates that we will likely be constrained for a while on the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max, but we are actively working to resolve this issue.",

For Q4, the foreign exchange impact on a sequential basis was negative 70 basis points and on a year-over-year basis it was negative 170 basis points, as nearly every currency worldwide has weakened against the dollar. Looking ahead, we have guided Q1 to be between 42.5% and 43.5%, acknowledging a year-over-year 330 basis point negative exchange impact, and a sequential unfavorable impact of 120 basis points. The strong dollar poses challenges in several areas, particularly affecting our pricing in emerging markets and the conversion of that revenue back into dollars. On a positive note, we are seeing favorable trends in commodities, which we believe will help mitigate the negative foreign exchange impacts we've experienced. Our guidance takes these factors into account, along with some level of inflationary pressures, resulting in a positive outlook.",

It was helped by the product launch of the MacBook Air with M2. It was helped that in the previous quarter, we lost output from the factory for a significant portion of the quarter. We had a backlog exiting our Q3 headed into Q4. We were able to satisfy all of that demand during Q4 and filled the channel for the Mac. This led to an incredible Mac quarter. If you look at iPad, iPad had sort of the opposite happening from a launch point of view. The compare from a year ago, we launched iPads in September. We launched iPads this year in October. The iPad Pro had just launched before the quarter started in the year-ago quarter so it was our first full quarter of iPad Pro. So it was an exceptionally strong iPad quarter a year ago, and the launches were key to that performance. That's the reason iPad contracted during this quarter.",

The good news is the artist will also get more money for their songs that are enjoyed on streaming. There is some bit of good news there. On Apple TV+, at the beginning, we only had a very few shows. We were focused on originals only. We had four or five shows or so in the beginning and priced it quite low. We now have a lot more content and are coming out with more each and every month.

We're working hard to satisfy the demand and get those products to customers. We also announced and launched the AirPods Pro in September. The reviews for the product have just been amazing in terms of the noise cancellation features and the sound quality. We're receiving great reviews. In terms of headwinds, FX was a headwind that affected Wearables, Home and Accessories, just like it affected the rest of our products and services.

We're very pleased with that. There were some areas that we could see some softness in digital advertising. Of course, you know that part and gaming on the App Store was affected. We were very happy with what we saw in terms of the behavior of our customers with the engagement with Services. The installed base is growing, which is a positive and a great foundation for the future. We're seeing more transacting accounts and paid accounts, both growing double digits.

We have a great subscription business, 900 million paid subs now on the platform, growing very fast. We doubled in 3 years.

Tim, I'm interested in discussing inflation pressures and labor issues both in the US and globally. What measures can Apple take to address these? Luca, regarding FX, it's becoming a significant challenge. Is there anything we can do to alleviate that?",

In terms of people, we're focused on taking care of our teams and offering them the best benefits and best compensation so that we can empower them to do the best work of their lives. We're focused on that for our teams. In terms of inflation, there are clearly wage inflation and inflation related to logistics as well. If you compare it to pre-pandemic levels, those have not returned to pre-pandemic levels by any means. Certain silicon components have inflationary pressure as well. That gives some ingredients of where we see inflation pressure. We've taken that into consideration in the gross margin guidance that Luca gave earlier in the call.",

          "content": "Yes, you're right. FX is a very significant factor affecting our results, both revenue and gross margin. What do we do about a situation with a very strong dollar? We hedge our exposures as much as possible around the world. For example, we've likely been the first company to hedge our exposure in China several years ago. There may be a few small currencies where we don't hedge because the cost is prohibitive or the market is not there. In general, we tend to hedge for a significant level of margin stability. Over time, that protection reduces because the hedges roll over and we need to buy new contracts. But that's the primary tool we use to offset some of the FX pressure. When launching new products, we look at the FX situation. In some cases, for international markets, customers had to see price increases when we launched new products, which is not something U.S. customers have seen. Unfortunately, that's the situation with the strong dollar. We really appreciated the performance during the quarter, especially given this strong dollar and difficult FX environment. We have seen strong performance in many international markets, particularly large emerging markets. Even in reported currencies, we are seeing very strong double-digit growth in places like India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Vietnam, where we did incredibly well. In local currency, those growth rates are even higher. It's important to consider how these markets perform in local currency because it shows customer response to our products and engagement with our ecosystem. In that respect, we feel very good about the progress we're making globally.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, Spain, Turkey and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year-over-year. But I'm proud of the way we have navigated circumstances, seen and unforeseen, over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in our team and our mission and in the work we do every day. Let me discuss the 3 factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact. On a constant currency basis, we grew year-over-year and would have grown in the vast majority of the markets we track. The second factor, which we described in a November 6 update, was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way throughout the pandemic, we continued to prioritize people and worked with our suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now back where we want it to be. The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances, from inflation to war in Eastern Europe to the enduring impacts of the pandemic. And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face, our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in people and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and help unlock their full creative potential. It's a wonderful thing to be a part of, and it's so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our customers are loving what we create. Let me talk now about what we saw across our product categories. Starting with iPhone. Revenue came in at $65.8 billion for the quarter, down 8% year-over-year. However, on a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what users can do with a smartphone. During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7 billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare because this time last year, we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity for Mac. Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro and M2 Max. These chips enable unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good for the environment but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac mini, which will supercharge productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful a Mac mini can be. During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4 billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints. Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it's the new iPad Pro now powered by the M2 or the newly designed iPad 10th Generation with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors. Revenue for Wearables, Home and Accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year-over-year driven by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example, a few weeks ago, we announced the next-generation HomePod, which is an indispensable addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We're also helping users make their homes safer with sound recognition. This feature, arriving later this spring, allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user's iPhone if a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified. We continue to hear wide praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard for what's possible with a wearable. From a whole host of health and safety features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal new features we've made available across many of our products as well. One of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone 14 customers in the U.S. and Canada in November and for customers in France, Germany, Ireland and the U.K. in December. This is a feature we hope our users will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get emails from people describing the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them. We're always looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December, we released Freeform, a brand-new app that lets users take their ideas wherever they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad and Mac. Today, we are very excited to announce that we've achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just 7 years ago. This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength of our ecosystem. We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services, which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions. Apple has also just begun a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access to every live MLS regular season game as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup, all with no blackouts. And while we're providing more content to sports fans than ever before, Apple TV+ continues to showcase powerful characters and moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our Apple TV+ subscribers with the hit movie Spirited. And we're delighted to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking, Slow Horses and Truth Be Told. And we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner Ted Lasso returning this spring. During the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness+ as well, expanding our catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we're excited to take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri and other apps. Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also opened Apple Pacific Centre in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey. And I'm grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled experience for our customers and every product and service that we offer. We're also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving users 3 new tools to protect their most sensitive data: iMessage contact key verification, security keys for Apple ID and advanced data protection for iCloud. At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave the world better than we found it. We're also a year closer to 2030, and we are ever focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade. As an example, the latest Mac mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And in a first for HomePod, we're using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black Unity collection, including the Special Edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport Loop, a new matching watch face and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial equity and justice initiative, we're expanding our support of 5 organizations focused on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed as ever to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity. During the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our Giving program 11 years ago, we've donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts, disaster relief, childhood education and more. And over the last 16 years through our partnership with (RED), Apple-supported grants have helped more than 11 million people get the care and support services they need. As we look ahead in 2023, we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward, always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident about the future of Apple than I have ever been. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion, down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew revenue on a constant currency basis. And in fact, we did so in the vast majority of markets. Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December. On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter that Tejas just mentioned at the beginning of the call. Products revenue was $96.4 billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product category. We're proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed base. This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products. The installed base growth also helped our services set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% over a year ago. We achieved this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas, Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and a December quarter record in Greater China. We also set records in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services, payment services and music and December quarter records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70 basis points from last quarter due to leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points sequentially. And Services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially, both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and grew at a slower pace than in the past as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was $30 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $34 billion. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion despite significant foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and a challenging macroeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances, we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy and Spain, and saw strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, the installed base of active iPhones continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments. In emerging markets, in particular, the installed base grew double digits, and we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue to love their experience with our products with the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. There were 3 key drivers for our Mac results. First, we had a challenging compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Max. Second, we believe that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, and we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Customer satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey of U.S. consumers from 451 Research. iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by 2 key items. First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply constraints, while this year, we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to our smartwatch that we've ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services. We generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in total and for many Services offerings in spite of a difficult foreign exchange environment and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew Services revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year ago. We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category, and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem. For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. Paid subscriptions also continued to grow nicely. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last 12 months alone and nearly 4x what we had just 5 years ago. And we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings. For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly 70 countries and regions. And we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season. Finally, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem, and it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with strong double-digit increases in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico, India, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam. Turning to the enterprise market, we are seeing continued adoption of our Services for business like Apple Business Essentials, AppleCare, Tap to Pay and Apple Financial Services. For example, Mars Incorporated has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile, HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant annual savings in the process. Let me now turn to our capital return program and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow. This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter, and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time. As we move into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the December quarter. This represents an acceleration in our underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited from an extra week. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of 5 percentage points. For Services, we expect revenue to grow year-over-year while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance.

We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.7 billion and $13.9 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $100 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%.

In the December quarter on a sequential basis, foreign exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis, it's 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during the last 12 months. For March, yes, we've seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to 44.5%. We're doing a lot of work around cost, of course. Mix will continue to help, both within categories and services mix as we move away from the holiday season. But we're doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points sequentially, but it's mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has weakened a bit.

The fact that our installed base is expanding significantly, especially in many emerging markets, provides us with a larger potential customer pool, which is crucial. Additionally, we are noticing an increase in customer engagement within our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts have grown in double digits, indicating a positive outlook for the future. Many transacting accounts are transitioning to paid accounts over time. Another critical factor is our ongoing commitment to enhancing the reach and quality of our services. For instance, Apple Pay started primarily in the United States and has now expanded to 70 markets with millions of merchants. Our payment services consistently achieve new highs. Over the past few years, we have also launched new services that contribute to this growth.

          "content": "Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we're reporting revenue of $94.8 billion for the March quarter, which was better than our expectations. We set an all-time record for Services and a March quarter record for iPhone. We were particularly pleased with the performance we saw in emerging markets and achieved all-time records in Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE, as well as a number of March quarter records, including in Brazil, Malaysia and India. This result is a testament, first and foremost to our teams around the world who are engaged every day in the work of bringing new innovations to life. It speaks to the incredible power of Apple products and services to enrich people's lives in indispensable ways. And whether it's in the design lab in Cupertino, or in one of the brand new retail stores in India, I am constantly inspired by the way our people come together to make a real difference in the world. During the March quarter, we continued to face foreign exchange headwinds, which had an impact of more than 500 basis points, as well as ongoing challenges related to the macroeconomic environment. Revenue was down 3% year-over-year as a result, while on a constant currency basis, we grew in total and in the vast majority of the markets we serve. Despite these challenges, we continue to manage for the long term and to push the limits of what's possible, always on behalf of the customers who depend on our products whether it's students exploring new frontiers, developers dreaming up their next big idea, or artists taking their creativity to a whole new level. Let me share how these results showed up across our lineup of products and services. Let's start with iPhone, which set a new March quarter record with revenue of $51.3 billion. The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus continue to delight users with their long-lasting battery and advanced camera. And our pro users continue to rave about the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone. This March, we were excited to expand emergency SOS via satellite to six new countries, bringing this important safety feature to even more users. We now offer this vital service in 12 countries, and I'm grateful for every note I've received from around the world about the life-saving impact of our safety features. Now let's turn to Mac, which recorded $7.2 billion in revenue for the March quarter in line with our expectations. As we noted during our last call, Mac faced a very difficult compare because of the incredibly successful rollout of our M1 chip throughout the Mac lineup last year. And like our other product lines, Mac is facing some macroeconomic and foreign exchange headwinds as well. That said, the advancements we've made in power-efficient performance continue to amaze our users. Our M2 Mac Mini customers are raving about the pro-level powerhouse packed into an ultra-compact design, and users are marveling at the power and speed at the heart of every M2 powered MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, which allowed them to sustain even the most demanding workloads. iPad revenue was $6.7 billion, which was also in line with our expectations. Similar to Mac, iPad revenue performance was impacted by macroeconomic challenges, foreign exchange headwinds, and a difficult compare with last year when we launched the M1 powered iPad Air. iPad's versatility continues to be its greatest strength as we're helping students learn on the same family of devices artists use to create their next masterpiece. Across wearables, home and accessories, revenue was $8.8 billion. With its exceptional range of game-changing health and safety features, Apple Watch becomes more indispensable every day. Apple Watch Ultra is attracting adventurers, athletes, and everyday users with its breakthrough features built for endurance and exploration. And with the summer travel season soon heating up, there's no better companion in the air or on the road than AirPods, the best and most popular headphones in the world. Meanwhile, Services set an all-time record with $20.9 billion in revenue for the March quarter. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, Apple Music, iCloud, and payment services. And now, with more than 975 million paid subscriptions, we're reaching even more people with our lineup of services. Apple TV Plus continues to draw praise from customers and reviewers alike. During the past quarter, fans tuned in to incredible new series like Shrinking and The Big Door Prize and got to welcome Ted Lasso back into their homes for a third season. Movies like Tetris are captivating viewers with many more to come, including Martin Scorsese\u2019s Killers of the Flower Moon later this year. Three years since its launch, Apple TV Plus programming has been celebrated across the globe, with over 1,450 nominations and more than 350 wins. Recently, we were thrilled to cheer on The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse, which won an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. The first season of our historic tenure partnership with Major League Soccer is well underway with MLS Season Pass; we've created the ultimate destination for soccer fans, offering subscribers the ability to watch every match without blackouts. And with baseball season in full swing, Apple TV Plus subscribers can watch their favorite teams with the return of Friday night baseball. This quarter, we launched Apple Music Classical, a standalone app that gives something special to classical music lovers. Apple Music Classical packs the largest library of classical music on Earth into a thoughtful and intuitive design that strikes all the right notes. Whether you're listening with AirPods or HomePod, the premium sound experience of Apple Music Classical will leave you with a feeling of being front row at the symphony just behind the conductor. In March, we also launched Apple Pay Later designed with users' privacy and financial health in mind. Apple Pay Later allows users to split purchases into multiple payments with no interest or fees. And last month, we introduced Apple Card Savings Accounts to give users even more value out of their daily cash Apple Card Benefit. At Apple, our customers are at the center of everything we do. Nowhere is that more evident than retail, where our teams are dedicated to sharing the best of Apple with our customers. And we're constantly innovating to deliver exceptional experiences and meet our customers where they are. In the US, we launched Shop with a Specialist over video, a new way for customers to learn about iPhone and find the one that's just right for them. And as I noted earlier, in a milestone for Apple, we just opened our first two Apple stores in India, in Mumbai and Delhi. I was there to see it for myself, and I couldn't have been more delighted by the excitement and enthusiasm of the customers, developers, creators, and team members I got to spend time with. I've had the chance to connect with customers and teams all around the world in recent months, and so many people shared with me that they were fans of Apple, not just because of the innovations we create, but because of the values that guide us, and that means a great deal to us. We're constantly striving to make a positive difference in people's lives and be a force for progress. We're investing in education to give students the skills they need to shape the future. We're helping to create pathways of opportunity for communities of color through our Racial Equity and Justice initiative. And every day we're building an even more inclusive and diverse Apple rooted in our culture of belonging. To better understand how our work intersects with our values, look no further than what we're doing for the environment. We just celebrated Earth Day in April, and during that month, Apple announced that its global manufacturing partners now support over 13 gigawatts of renewable energy, a nearly 30% increase in just the last year. This translates to 17.4 million metric tons of avoided carbon emissions, the equivalent of removing nearly 3.8 million cars from the road. We're all investing up to an additional $200 million in our Restore Fund, which is designed to support innovative, scalable, nature-based carbon removal projects, with the goal of removing 1 million metric tons of carbon every year. These are just the latest steps on our journey toward our 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our supply chain and lifecycle of our devices. At the same time, while we're advancing renewable energy across our supply chain, we're also sourcing more recycled materials in our products. Last month, we announced our plans to have all Apple design batteries include 100% certified recycled cobalt by 2025, and we remain committed to one day using only recycled and renewable materials in our products. We have a deep sense of mission here at Apple. We believe in the power of innovation to build a better world. We are determined to do our best work on behalf of our customers and to give them the tools that can enrich lives. So we will manage for the long term, just as we always have, with our eyes to the horizon, with limitless creativity, and with a deep belief that we can achieve anything we put our minds to. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $94.8 billion, down 3% from last year and better than our expectations. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over five percentage points on our results, in line with what we had expected. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. In addition to the records in emerging markets that Tim mentioned, we also set March quarter records in Australia, Canada, Spain, and Switzerland, among others. Products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% from last year, due to challenging compares on Mac and iPad. iPhone, however, reached a March quarter revenue record thanks to very strong performance in emerging markets from South Asia and India to Latin America and the Middle East. During the quarter, our installed base of active devices continued to grow at a nice pace thanks to extremely high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments. Our Services set an all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, on top of growing 17% in the March quarter a year ago. We reached an all-time services revenue record in Greater China and March quarter records in Americas, Europe, and Rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.3%, up 130 basis points from last quarter, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards services partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.7%, decreasing 30 basis points sequentially due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 71%, up 20 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.7 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and continued to decelerate from the December quarter. We are closely managing our spend but remain focused on long-term growth with continued investment in innovation and product development. Net income was $24.2 billion. Diluted earnings per share were $1.52, unchanged versus last year, and we generated very strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue set a March quarter record of $51.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year despite significant foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We set March quarter records in several developed and emerging markets with India, Indonesia, Turkey, and the UAE doubling on a year-over-year basis. Our active installed base of iPhone grew to a new all-time high and was up in all our geographic segments. We are very pleased by the results of the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research, which measured customer satisfaction at 99% for the iPhone 14 family. Mac revenue was $7.2 billion, down 31% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by the challenging macroeconomic environment coupled with a difficult compare against last year's launch of the completely reimagined M1 MacBook Pros. Despite this, the installed base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments and we continue to see strong upgraded activity to Apple silicon. Also, the latest survey of US Consumers from 451 Research reported customer satisfaction at 96% for Mac. iPad generated $6.7 billion in revenue, down 13% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. This performance was due to two key factors: a tough compare against the launch of iPad Air powered by the M1 chip in the year-ago quarter and headwinds from the macroeconomic environment. The iPad installed base reached a new all-time high in all geographic segments thanks to exceptional customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home and accessories revenue was $8.8 billion, down 1% year-over-year as the category experienced the impact from the macroeconomic environment. However, we did set March quarter records both in the US and in Greater China. We continue to see strength in our Watch installed base, which set a new all-time record, thanks to very high customer loyalty and new users; nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving to Services, we reached a new all-time revenue record of $20.9 billion. And in addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we set March quarter records for advertising, Apple Care, and Video. Despite these records, as we saw in recent quarters, certain services offerings such as digital advertising and mobile gaming continue to be affected by the current macroeconomic environment. Stepping back, however, the continued growth in Services is a reflection of our ecosystem strength and the positive momentum we are seeing across several key metrics. Our growing installed base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem. We continue to grow across every major product category and geographic segment, thanks to very high levels of customer loyalty and satisfaction. Second, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. Third, paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We now have more than 975 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only three years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services offerings from new content on Apple TV Plus to great new features available in Apple Pay and Apple Music, which we believe our customers will love. Turning to the enterprise market, we see business customers continuing to invest in the Apple platform to drive higher employee productivity and satisfaction. In Brazil, Boticario Group, the world's largest cosmetics franchiser, originally starting with iPhone, 12 employees manage operations across a network of retail stores, franchisees, and resellers. As it continues to digitize its business, Boticario has chosen to move all software development in-house and adopted Mac as the standard device for all of their developer teams across the world. In small business, we see an increasing number of customers relying on Apple hardware, software, and services to power their businesses forward, from accepting payments on iPhone, to tracking inventory on Mac or iPad, to managing employee devices with Apple Business Essentials. As we celebrate National Small Business week here in the US, we are proud to continue supporting the small business community. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by about $300 million, leaving us with total debt of $110 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the March quarter, we returned over $23 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19.1 billion through open market repurchases of $129 million Apple shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, today our Board has authorized an additional $90 billion for share repurchases as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash neutral over time. We're also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.24 a share, and we continue to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the March quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook does not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind and we expect a negative year-over-year impact of nearly four percentage points. For Services, we expect our June quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be similar to the March quarter while continuing to face macroeconomic headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 44.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $250 million excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, reflecting the dividend increase I mentioned earlier, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on May 18, 2023, to shareholders of record as on May 15, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

If we go back to the December quarter and the shutdowns, the production shutdowns around the time I think the question a lot of us were asking was how should we think about the deferral of demand versus destruction of demand? The March quarter was quite strong, 2% year-over-year iPhone growth. And so as we sit here in May, how have you seen that customers that weren't able to purchase during the December quarter behave? Meaning, are you seeing that they deferred purchases to March and June? Could they be deferring purchases to later and hopes of buying a new iPhone? Just how should maybe we think about the cadence of that and then I have a follow-up? Thanks.",

So maybe can you just talk about why you see India as such an important market and others, how you think about monetization trends in the country and specifically what you have to do within the country to really ensure that India becomes maybe a more material mix of your business?

I was just there, and the dynamism in the market, the vibrancy is unbelievable. Over time, we've been expanding our operations there to serve more customers, and three years ago, we launched the Apple Store online, and then, as you just mentioned, we launched two stores just a few weeks ago, and they're off to a great start, one in Mumbai and one in Delhi. We've got a number of channel partners in the country as well that we're partnering with, and we're very happy with how that's going overall. Overall, I couldn't be more delighted and excited by the enthusiasm I'm seeing for the brand there. There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there. On other emerging markets, we had a stellar quarter in emerging markets overall, as I had mentioned, with records set in a number of different places, including Indonesia and Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, UAE, and then quarterly records in Brazil, India, and Malaysia. And so it was a great quarter for emerging markets in general, despite the headwinds of the currency that Luca mentioned.",

And that's despite declines in current quarter sales, in particular in Mac and iPad. This is a huge asset for us, and it's a testament to the overall customer satisfaction and engagement and loyalty of our customers. And so we view this as a major asset for us. The iPhone base is well over a $1 billion active devices. We see this as upgrade rates, and these sorts of things may change quarter-to-quarter depending upon macroeconomic factors. But if you back up and look at the installed base, we feel great about the size of it and the rate that it's growing.",

For the first time in several quarters, foreign exchange, we expect foreign exchange to be flat on a sequential basis at the gross margin level. Unfortunately, it's still a headwind at the revenue level, but at gross margin level, sequentially, we expect foreign exchange not to be a factor. And so the seasonal loss of leverage that you're referring to, we expect to be offset by cost savings. And so that should give us that level of margins. As you know, you were asking about the 50 basis points. We have guided to 50 basis points of a range before as well, this year in particular, because of the 14th week during the December quarter, we're a bit late in the calendar year, right.

And so we were pleased with how we did and with the acceleration that we saw with the reopening, and we'll see how we do this quarter. But if you look at the top selling smartphones in urban China, based on a survey from Kantar, we have four out of the top five. And I think in all of the third-party data I've seen on the market itself, in the smartphone space, we believe we gained share during Q2. So we feel good about it. Also, China has a lot of very good metrics in terms of new buyers. For example, on the Mac, about six out of ten customers are buying the Mac for the first time. Same thing on iPad. If you look over at the watch, it's more than three out of four customers are buying the watch for the first time. And so the buyer metrics, if you will, are very, very good.

          "content": "Thank you, Saori. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $81.8 billion for the June quarter, better than our expectations. We continued to see strong results in emerging markets, driven by robust sales of iPhone with June quarter total revenue records in India, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the UAE. We set June quarter records in a number of other countries as well, including France, the Netherlands and Austria. And we set an all-time revenue record in Services driven by more than $1 billion paid subscriptions. We continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including nearly 4 percentage points of foreign exchange headwinds. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to the prior year's quarter in aggregate and in the majority of markets we track. We continue to manage deliberately and innovate relentlessly, and we are driven by the sense of possibility those efforts inspire. To that end, before I turn to the quarter in more detail, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented innovations we were proud to announce at our Worldwide Developers Conference. In addition to extraordinary new Macs and incredible updates to our software platforms, we had the chance to introduce the world to spatial computing. We were so pleased to share the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro with the world, a bold new product unlike anything else created before. Apple Vision Pro is a marvel of engineering, built on decades of innovation only possible at Apple. It is the most advanced personal electronic device ever created, and we've been thrilled by the reaction from press, analysts, developers and content creators who've had the chance to try it. We can't wait to get it into customers' hands early next year. Now let me share more with you on our June quarter results beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $39.7 billion for the quarter, down 2% from the year ago quarter's record performance. On a constant currency basis, iPhone revenue grew, and we had a June quarter record for switchers, reflecting the popularity of the iPhone lineup. iPhone 14 customers continue to praise the exceptional battery life and essential health and safety features, while iPhone 14 Plus users are loving the new larger screen size. And with Dynamic Island, Always-On display and the most powerful camera system ever in an iPhone, the iPhone 14 Pro lineup is our best ever. Turning to Mac. We recorded $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We are proud to have completed the transition of our entire Mac lineup to run exclusively on Apple silicon. We are also excited to have introduced the new 15-inch MacBook Air during the quarter, the world's best 15-inch laptop and one of the best Macs we've ever made. And we launched 2 new powerhouses in computing, Mac Studio with M2 Max and M2 Ultra and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra, which are the most powerful Macs we've ever made. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion for the June quarter, down 20% year-over-year, in part due to a difficult compare because of the timing of the iPad Air launch last year. Customers are loving iPad's versatility and exceptional value. There was a great deal of excitement from creatives when we brought Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro to iPad this spring. And with the back-to-school season in full swing, iPad has the power to help students tackle the toughest assignments. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Packed with features to empower users to live a healthier life, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Ultra continue to help people take the next step on their wellness journey. As I mentioned earlier, last quarter, we held our biggest and most exciting WWDC yet. We were thrilled to welcome developers from across the globe to Apple Park, both in person and virtually, and to share some stunning new announcements with the world. In addition to Apple Vision Pro and the new Macs that we introduced, we had the chance to reveal some truly remarkable new innovations to our software platforms. From exciting new features like Live Voicemail and StandBy in iOS 17, to new tools for users to work, play and personalize their experience in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, to a fresh design and new workout capabilities in watchOS 10, there's so much coming later this year to empower users to get more out of their devices, and we think they're going to instantly love these new features. It was also an exciting quarter for Services where revenue reached $21.2 billion and saw a sequential acceleration to an 8% year-over-year increase, better than we expected. We set an all-time revenue record for total services and in a number of categories, including video, AppleCare, cloud and payment services. Since we introduced Apple Pay almost a decade ago, customers have been loving how easy it is to make purchases online, in apps and in stores. We're also pleased to see Apple Card build on the success of Apple Pay. Designed with our users' financial health in mind, Apple Card has become one of the most successful credit card programs in the U.S. with award-winning customer satisfaction. And this spring, we introduced a new high-yield savings account for Apple Card customers, which has become incredibly popular, with customers already making more than $10 billion in deposits. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ continues to provide a spectacular showcase of imaginative storytelling. Recently, fans welcomed new series like Hijack and Silo as well as returning fan favorites like Foundation and The Afterparty. In the few years since its launch, Apple TV+ has earned more than 1,500 nominations and 370 wins. That includes the 54 Emmy Award nominations across 13 titles that Apple TV+ received last month. It's also been an exciting time for sports on Apple TV+. Soccer legend Lionel Messi made his debut with Major League Soccer last month, and fans all over the world tuned in with MLS Season Pass. We are excited about our MLS partnership, and we're thrilled to see Messi suiting up with Inter Miami. And just in time for summer concert season, Apple Music launched new discovery features celebrating live music, including venue guides in Apple Maps and set lists from tours of major artists. These new features and others join a lineup of updates coming later this year to make Services more powerful, more useful and more fun than ever. Everything we do is in service of our customers, and retail is where we bring the best of Apple. During the quarter, we opened the Apple Store online in Vietnam, and we're excited to connect with more customers there. We also redesigned our first-ever Apple Store located in Tysons Corner, Northern Virginia, with inclusive, innovative and sustainable design enhancements. We opened a beautiful new store beneath our new London headquarters in the historic Battersea Power Station. And the performance of the stores we opened in India this spring exceeded our initial expectations. With every product we create, every feature we develop and every interaction we share with our customers, we lead with the values we stand for. We believe in creating technology that serves all of humanity, which is why accessibility has always been a core value that we embed in everything we do. On Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we unveiled some extraordinary new tools for cognitive, vision, hearing and mobile accessibility that will be available later this year, including Assistive Access, which distills apps to their most essential features, and Personal Voice, which allows users to create a synthesized voice that sounds just like them. Building technology and service of our customers also means protecting their privacy, which we believe is a fundamental human right. That's why we were pleased to announce major updates to Safari Private Browsing, Communication Safety and Lockdown Mode to further safeguard our users. And as part of our efforts to build a better world, we announced that we've more than doubled our initial commitment to our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative to more than $200 million. We will continue to do our part to support education, economic empowerment and criminal justice reform work. And while supporting efforts to advance equity and opportunity, we continue to build a culture of belonging at Apple and a workforce that reflects the communities we serve. Through our environmental work, we're making strides in our commitment to leave the world better than we found it. Last month, Apple joined with global nonprofit Acumen in a new effort to improve livelihoods in India through clean energy innovation, and we are as committed as ever to our Apple 2030 goal to be carbon neutral across our entire supply chain and the life cycle of our products. We've long held that education is the great equalizer. With that in mind, we're expanding Apple Learning Coach, a free professional learning program that teaches educators how to get more out of Apple technology in the classroom. Today, we welcome more than 1,900 educators across the U.S. to the program. By the end of the year, we'll offer Apple Learning Coach in 12 more countries. As we're connecting with teachers, we're also celebrating the graduations of students at our app developer academies around the world. From Detroit, to Naples, to Riyadh and more, we're excited to watch these talented developers embark on careers in coding and find ways to make a positive difference in their communities. Apple remains a champion of innovation, a company fueled by boundless creativity, driven by a deep sense of mission and guided by the unshakable belief that a great idea can change the world. Looking ahead, we'll continue to manage for the long term, always pushing the limits of what's possible and always putting the customer at the center of everything we do. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the June quarter was $81.8 billion, down 1% from last year and better than our expectations despite nearly 4 percentage points of negative impact from foreign exchange. On a constant currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in the majority of the markets we track. We set June quarter records in both Europe and Greater China and continued to see strong performance across our emerging markets driven by iPhone. Products revenue was $60.6 billion, down 4% from last year, as we faced FX headwinds and an uneven macroeconomic environment. However, our installed base reached an all-time high across all geographic segments, driven by a June quarter record for iPhone switchers and high new-to rates in Mac, iPad and Watch, coupled with very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $21.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year and grew double digits in constant currency. Our performance was strong around the world as we reached all-time Services revenue records in Americas and Europe and June quarter records in Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Company gross margin was 44.5%, a record level for the June quarter and up 20 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and favorable mix shift towards Services, partially offset by a seasonal loss of leverage. Products gross margin was 35.4%, down 130 basis points from last quarter due to seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 70.5%, decreasing 50 basis points sequentially. Operating expenses of $13.4 billion were below the low end of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and decelerated from the March quarter. We continue to take a deliberate approach in managing our spend with strong focus on innovation and new product development. The results of these actions delivered net income of $19.9 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.26, up 5% versus last year, and very strong operating cash flow of $26.4 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.7 billion, down 2% year-over-year but grew on a constant currency basis. We set revenue records in several markets around the world, including an all-time record in India and June quarter records in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, Indonesia, the Philippines, Italy, the Netherlands and the U.K. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, thanks to a June quarter record in switchers. This is a testament to our extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% for the iPhone 14 family in the U.S. Mac generated $6.8 billion in revenue, down 7% year-over-year. We continue to invest in our Mac portfolio. And this past quarter, we were pleased to complete the transition to Apple silicon for the entire lineup. This transition has driven both strong upgrade activity and a high number of new customers. In fact, almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product. We also saw reported customer satisfaction of 96% for Mac in the U.S. iPad revenue was $5.8 billion, down 20% year-over-year and in line with our expectations. These results were driven by a difficult compare against the full quarter impact of the iPad Air launch in the prior year. At the same time, we continue to attract a large number of new customers to the iPad installed base with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $8.3 billion, up 2% year-over-year, with a June quarter record in Greater China and strong performance in several emerging markets. We continue to see Apple Watch expand its reach with about 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And this is combined with very high levels of customer satisfaction, which was recently reported at 98% in the United States. Moving on to Services. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $21.2 billion with year-over-year growth accelerating sequentially to 8% and up double digits in constant currency. In addition to the all-time records Tim mentioned earlier, we also set June quarter records for advertising, App Store and Music. We are very pleased with our performance in Services, which is a direct reflection of our ecosystem's strength. First, our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. Second, we see increased customer engagement with our services. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Third, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. This past quarter, we reached an important milestone and passed 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, up 150 million during the last 12 months and nearly double the number of paid subscriptions we had only 3 years ago. And finally, we continue to improve the breadth and the quality of our current services. From 20 new games on Apple Arcade, to brand-new content on Apple TV+, to the launch of our high-yield savings account with Apple Card, our customers are loving these enhanced offerings. Turning to the enterprise market. Our customers are leveraging Apple products every day to help improve productivity and attract talent. Blackstone, a global investment management firm, is expanding its Apple footprint from their corporate iPhone fleet to now offering the MacBook Air powered by M2 to all of their corporate employees and portfolio companies. Gilead, a leading biopharmaceutical company, has deployed thousands of iPads globally to their sales team. Over the last 6 months, they have also doubled their Mac user base by making MacBook Air available to more employees with a focus on user experience and strong security. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $166 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $7.5 billion in maturing debt while issuing $5.2 billion of new debt and increasing commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $109 billion. As a result, net cash was $57 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $24 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $18 billion through open market repurchases of 103 million Apple shares. We continue to believe there is great value in our stock and maintain our target of reaching a net cash neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Saori referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect our September quarter year-over-year revenue performance to be similar to the June quarter, assuming that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Foreign exchange will continue to be a headwind, and we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of over 2 percentage points. We expect iPhone and Services year-over-year performance to accelerate from the June quarter. Also, we expect the revenue for both Mac and iPad to decline by double digits year-over-year due to difficult compares, particularly on the Mac. For both products, we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter a year ago and were able to fulfill significant pent-up demand in the year ago September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 44% and 45%. We expect OpEx to be between $13.5 billion and $13.7 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on August 17, 2023, to shareholders of record as of August 14, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

Other emerging markets such as India also saw record sales in June, along with strong performance in Indonesia, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. In the Americas, particularly in the United States, we did see a slight improvement in performance, although there was a decline overall due to the smartphone market experiencing a downturn for the past few quarters in the U.S.",

We have a commodity environment that is favorable to us. Our product mix is quite strong at this point. And so with the exception of foreign exchange, which continues to be a drag, and it was a significant drag on a year-over-year basis, yes, we are in a good position right now. We are in a good position for the June quarter. And as I mentioned, we expect similar levels of gross margins for the same reasons, frankly, for the September quarter.",

We were able to satisfy the pent-up demand from those shutdowns in the September quarter, resulting in an unusual level of activity a year ago.

And that percentage, which again, it's well over 50%, is very similar across developed and emerging markets. We want to do more of that because we think it really helps reduce the affordability threshold for our products.

And from a commodity perspective, I know last quarter, you talked about buying a lot of inventory at favorable prices, which was an incredibly smart strategy. Where do you sit today?

In the U.S., which constitutes the majority of the Americas segment, there was also a slight sequential acceleration, although year-over-year, the Americas continue to decline to some extent, as shown in the data sheet. The main reason for this decline is the current challenges in the U.S. smartphone market.

We had all-time records in cloud, in video, in AppleCare, in payments and June quarter records in App Store, advertising and Music. So we saw improvement in all our Services categories. We think the situation will continue to improve as we go through September. And that's very positive because not only good for the financial results, but obviously, it shows a high level of engagement of our customers in the ecosystem, which is very important for us. And it's really the sum of all the things that I mentioned in my prepared remarks. It goes from the fact that our installed base continues to grow, so we've got a larger pool of customers, to the fact that our customers are more engaged as we have more transacting accounts and paid accounts on the ecosystem. And the subscriptions business is very healthy with growth of 150 million paid subscriptions just in the last 12 months. It's almost double to what we had 3 years ago. And of course, we are providing more and more content to our users. And so the combination of all these things gives us good confidence for September.",

Very important for us because, again, it shows that the engagement with the ecosystem in a market that is so important for us like China continues to grow. It means that there's more and more customers that are owning more than the iPhone. Also, we continue to grow the installed base of the category very quickly because, as I mentioned, 2/3 of every buyer of Apple Watch during the course of the June quarter was new to the product. And so that is all additive to the installed base. So it's just great to see that the AirPods continue to be a great success in the marketplace for us. And so things are moving in the right direction there. It's become a very large business for us in Wearables, Home and Accessories. The last 12 months, we've done $40 billion of business, which is nearly the size of a Fortune 100 company.

We achieved an all-time revenue record in India, as well as September quarter records in several countries, including Brazil, Canada, France, Indonesia, Mexico, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the UAE, Vietnam and more. iPhone revenue came in ahead of our expectations, setting a September quarter record, as well as quarterly records in many markets, including China mainland, Latin America, the Middle-East, South Asia and an all-time record in India. In services, we set an all-time revenue record with double-digit growth and ahead of our expectations. During the September quarter, we continued to face an uneven macroeconomic environment, including foreign exchange headwinds, and we've navigated these challenges by following the same principles that have always guided us. We've continued to invest in the future and manage for the long-term. We've adapted continuously to circumstances beyond our control, while being thoughtful and deliberate on spending. And we've carved a path of groundbreaking innovations and delivered with excellence every step of the way. That includes Apple Vision Pro, which has received such an amazing response from developers who are currently creating truly incredible apps. We're excited to get this magical product in the hands of customers early next year. Now let me share more about our products, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue came in at $43.8 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, and a new record for the September quarter. This fall, we were thrilled to debut the iPhone 15 lineup. The all-new iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous design, powerful cameras, and the intuitive Dynamic Island. Powered by the industry-leading A17 Pro, our iPhone 15 Pro lineup has a beautiful strong and durable titanium design and the best iPhone camera system ever, including a 5X Telephoto lens on iPhone 15 Pro Max. Customers are loving the entire iPhone 15 family, and reviews have been outstanding. In Mac, revenue came in at $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year from the prior year's record quarter. This was due to challenging market conditions, as well as difficult comparisons against the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Earlier this week, we were excited to unveil the next generation of Apple silicon with our incredible family of M3 chips: M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. We're continuing to innovate at a tremendous pace, and our industry-leading lineup of personal computers just got even better. The new MacBook Pro lineup brings our most advanced technology to our Pro users, while iMac, the world's best-selling all-in-one, just got faster and more capable. According to the latest data from Student Monitor, nearly two out of three college students chose a Mac. We couldn't be more excited about the future. Turning to iPad, revenue for the September quarter was $6.4 billion. iPad sets the gold standard for tablets, and our competitors are unable to match the iPad experience that is enabled by our seamless integration of hardware and software. iPad is also our most versatile product. In classrooms around the world, it's helping educators bring lessons to life, while giving students a window into the world around them. In artist workshops, design studios, and everywhere else, creative minds come together; iPad supercharges the creative process, helping users take their ideas further than they ever could before. Across wearables, home, and accessories, revenue came in at $9.3 billion. Apple Watch has become essential in our lives, and this is our best Apple Watch lineup ever. With Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2, we're giving people even more tools to stay safe and live healthy, active lives. With the new double tap gesture, users can easily control Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 using just one hand and without touching the display. It feels like magic. Our latest Apple Watch lineup also includes our first-ever carbon-neutral products, a significant achievement of innovation and determination. Apple's unique ecosystem of hardware, software, and services delivers an unparalleled user experience. During the quarter, we also had the chance to introduce a range of exciting new updates to our software that will allow users to get even more out of their devices. Whether it's personalized contact posters and new FaceTime features in iOS 17, new tools for users to make their experience their own in macOS Sonoma and iPadOS 17, or a bold new look in watchOS 10 that lets you see and do more, faster than ever, Apple is delivering an even better, richer experience that users are loving. Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, a 16% year-over-year increase. We achieved all-time revenue records across App Store, advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, payment services, and video, as well as the September quarter revenue record in Apple Music. Whether subscribers are waking up to headlines on Apple News+, getting their morning workout in with Fitness+, feeling the beat with Apple Music on their way to work or school, or unwinding at the end of the day with Apple Arcade, we have so many different services to enrich their day. Apple TV+ continues to delight customers as well, with new and returning shows like the Morning Show, Lessons in Chemistry, and Monarch. We're telling impactful stories that inspire imagination and stir the soul. Making movies that make a difference is also at the heart of Apple TV+, and we were thrilled to produce Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a powerful work of cinema that premiered in theaters around the world last month. We're proud to say that since launch, just over four years ago, Apple TV+ has earned nearly 1,600 award nominations and nearly 400 wins. We also offer subscribers an unprecedented live sports experience with MLS Season Pass. We couldn't be more pleased with how our partnership with Major League Soccer has gone in its first year. Subscriptions to MLS Season Pass have exceeded our expectations, and we're excited to continue that momentum next year. With the playoffs now underway, we can't wait to see who takes home the MLS cup. And nowhere does the magic of Apple come alive more than it does in our stores. Over the past year, we've continued to find ways to connect with even more customers. We welcomed customers to our first-ever retail locations in India. We also opened doors to new stores in Korea, China, and the UK and expanded the Apple store online to Vietnam and Chile. We have another store opening in China this week. In September, I joined our team at Apple Fifth Avenue on launch day, and the energy and excitement were unbelievable. Every time we connect with the customer, we're reminded why we do what we do. From the simple joys of creating and sharing memories to lifesaving features like emergency SOS via satellite, we're enriching lives in ways large and small. Whether we're working to safeguard user privacy, ensure technology made by Apple is accessible for everyone, or build an even more inclusive workplace, we're determined to lead with our values. Our environmental efforts are a great example of the intersection of our work and our values. Across Apple, we act on a simple premise: the best products in the world should be the best products for the world. We've made our environmental work a central focus of our innovation, because we feel a responsibility to leave the world better than we found it, and because we know that climate change cannot be stopped unless everyone steps up and does their part. Our first-ever carbon-neutral products represent a major milestone, and we're going to go even further. We plan to make every product across our lineup carbon neutral by the end of the decade. And we're not doing it alone. Over 300 of our suppliers have committed to using 100% clean energy for Apple production by 2030. We also continue to invest in entrepreneurs who are lighting the way for a greener, more equitable future. Through our third impact accelerator class, we're proud to support a new class of diverse innovators on the cutting edge of green technology and clean energy. Apple is always looking forward, driven in equal measure by a sense of possibility and a deep belief in our purpose. We're motivated by the meaningful difference we can make for our customers and keenly determined to push the limits of technology even further. And that's why I'm so confident that Apple's future is bright. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the September quarter was $89.5 billion, down less than 1% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of over 2 percentage points. On a constant-currency basis, our revenue grew year-over-year in total and in each geographic segment. We set a September quarter record in the Americas and saw strong performance across our emerging markets, where both iPhone and Services grew double digits. Products revenue was $67.2 billion, down 5% from last year, due to very challenging comparisons on both Mac and iPad, which I will discuss in more detail later on. At the same time, we reached a September quarter record on iPhone, driven by strength in emerging markets. Our total installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments, thanks to our high levels of customer satisfaction and many new customers joining our ecosystem. Our Services revenue set an all-time record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year, with growth accelerating sequentially from the June quarter. Our performance in Services was broad-based, as we reached all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia-Pacific, and a September quarter record in Greater China. We also set new records in every Services category. Company gross margin set a September quarter record at 45.2%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 36.6%, up 120 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.9%, up 40 basis points from last quarter due to a different mix. Operating expenses of $13.5 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided, up 2% year-over-year. Net income was $23 billion, diluted earnings per share was $1.46, up 13% versus last year and a September quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $21.6 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $43.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year and a new September quarter record. We had strong performance in several markets, including an all-time record in India, as well as September quarter records in Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and fiscal 2023 was another record year for switches. We continue to see extremely high levels of customer satisfaction, which 451 Research recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.6 billion, down 34% year-over-year, driven by challenging market conditions and compounded by a difficult compare in our own business, whereby last year we experienced supply disruptions from factory shutdowns in the June quarter and were subsequently able to fulfill significant pent-up demand during the September quarter. We also had a difference in launch timing with the MacBook Air launching earlier this year in the June quarter compared to the September quarter last year. We have great confidence in our Mac lineup and are excited about the recently announced iMac and MacBook Pro powered by our M3 chips. Our installed base is at an all-time high, and half of Mac buyers during the quarter were new to the product, driven by MacBook Air. We also saw reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $6.4 billion in revenue, down 10% year-over-year. Similar to Mac, these results were a function of a difficult compare from the supply disruptions in the June quarter a year ago and the subsequent fulfillment of pent-up demand in the September quarter. iPad continues to attract a large number of new customers to the installed base, with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $9.3 billion, down 3% year-over-year. We had a September quarter record in Europe, and we saw strong performance in several emerging markets around the world. Apple Watch continues to expand its reach, with nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for the Watch was recently measured at 97% in the U.S. Services had a great quarter. We reached a new all-time revenue record of $22.3 billion, up 16% year-over-year. We're happy to see growth coming from all categories and every geographic segment, which is a direct result of the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base of over 2 billion active devices continues to grow at a nice pace and establishes a solid foundation for the future expansion of the ecosystem. We continue to see increased customer engagement with our Services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double-digits year-over-year, each reaching a new all-time high. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, nearly double the number we had only three years ago. We continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from exciting new content on Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade to additional storage tiers on iCloud. We believe our customers will love this new offering. Turning to enterprise, we are excited to see our business customers in both developed and emerging markets expand their deployment of Apple products and technologies to drive business innovation and employee satisfaction. Starbucks continuously invests in Apple technology to bring the best experience to the customers and employees, including tens of thousands of iPads across all retail stores to help their teams streamline order management, operations, and training. In addition, Starbucks recently refreshed over 10,000 Macs to the latest M2-powered MacBook Air for all store managers, enabling them to do their best work and improve productivity. In Indonesia, popular technology company GoTo is offering Mac as a choice so that employees can have the best tools to be most productive. Today, more than half of its workforce are already choosing Mac for work. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with over $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We increased commercial paper by $2 billion, leaving us with total debt of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $51 billion at the end of the quarter. Our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $25 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $15.5 billion through open market repurchases of 85 million Apple shares. We also began a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase program in August, resulting in the initial delivery and retirement of 22 million shares. Taking a step back, as we close our 2023 fiscal year, our annual revenue was $383 billion. While it was down 3% from the prior year, it grew on a constant-currency basis despite the volatile and uneven macroeconomic environment. Our year-over-year revenue performance improved each quarter as we went through the year, and so did our earnings per share performance, as we reported double-digit EPS growth in the September quarter. We are particularly pleased with our performance in emerging markets, with revenue reaching an all-time record in fiscal 2023 and double-digit growth in constant currency. We are expanding our direct presence in these markets from new Apple retail stores in India to online stores in Vietnam and Chile. We continue to work with our partners to offer a wide range of affordability programs so that we can best serve our customers. We're very excited about the momentum we have in these markets and the opportunity ahead of us. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. Also, on foreign exchange, we expect a negative year-over-year revenue impact of about 1 percentage point. As a reminder, the December quarter this year will last the usual 13 weeks, whereas the December quarter a year ago spanned 14 weeks. For clarity, revenue from the extra week last year added approximately 7 percentage points to the quarter's total revenue. Despite having one less week this year, we expect our December quarter total company revenue to be similar to last year. We expect iPhone revenue to grow year-over-year on an absolute basis. We also expect to grow after normalizing for both last year's supply disruptions and the one extra week. We expect Mac year-over-year performance to significantly accelerate from the September quarter. We expect the year-over-year revenue performance for both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories to decelerate significantly from the September quarter due to a different timing of product launches. On iPad, we launched a new iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation during the December quarter a year ago. For the Wearable category, last year we had the full December quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd Generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. For our Services business, we expect the average revenue per week to grow at a similar strong double-digit rate as it did during the September quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 45% and 46%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.4 billion and $14.6 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $200 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock, payable on November 16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of November 13, 2023. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

To just repeat a little bit about the circumstances of the performance last quarter, in the year-ago June quarter, we had a factory disruption that lasted several weeks. The pent-up demand that resulted from that was filled in the September quarter, and that made the September quarter not only a record but a substantial record. Obviously, we're now comparing against that for '23, so I wouldn't look at the negative 34% as representative of the underlying business performance; it's sort of the net of it.",

Services also experienced growth during the quarter, but the Mac and iPad were hindered by similar challenges the company faced with production disruptions in Q3 that were later resolved in Q4 of '22. Last year, we had the top four selling phones in urban China, and after my recent trip there, I am extremely excited about the interactions I had with both customers and employees.",

Obviously, the commodity environment is one of them, as you mentioned. It's been a good environment in recent quarters. Equally important is the mix of what we sell. Obviously, growth in Services for us is favorable, and that has helped our company gross margin. Foreign exchange, on the other hand, has been a drag for us for several quarters, given the strength of the dollar. We don't provide guidance past the December quarter, which is a very important one for us because it's the beginning of the product cycle for many products.

Some of the U.S. carriers obviously haven't been particularly aggressive in promoting upgrades. So just wanted to kind of get a sense, first, what you're seeing from your partners in the U.S. currently and going forward, and what do you expect? And then, second, Luca, on the margins, is it fair to say that the mix in Q1 from a product versus services dynamic is kind of the key driver of the better gross margin guidance as a whole relative to, let's say, the December quarter? Or is there anything else? I know you mentioned there's a lot of moving pieces, but is that the primary driver of the uplift in the margin? Thanks.",

We step back and think about why our Services business is doing well and it's because we have an installed base of customers that continues to grow at a very nice pace and the engagement in our ecosystem continues to grow. We have more transacting accounts, we have more paid accounts, we have more subscriptions on the platform, and we continue to add content and features.

The guidance that we provided for December reflects all that, and we're starting from a better position than a year ago or in the past, in general. There are other factors that play a role; for example, the mix of products that we sell. Not every product has the same gross margin profile, so our guidance and our results are reflective of that. Over the last few years, we've made great strides in providing more affordability solutions to our customers in the form of installment plans, trading options, and low-cost financing. This has reduced the affordability threshold for our customers, allowing them to buy at the top of our product ranges. We don't provide guidance or color past the current quarter because there are so many different variables affecting gross margins, but we feel good about the trajectory we've had in 2023 and now the guidance for the beginning of fiscal '24.

We have pretty good visibility on these metrics. The progress we're making in Services, we achieved $85 billion in the last 12 months. That's the size of a Fortune 50 and significantly bigger than it was just a couple of years ago.",

          "content": "Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and the rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year. Now, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro, and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SOS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact. Turning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game. A favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in-one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult comparison with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home, and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult comparison with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double-tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 makes it easier to answer calls, play and pause music, or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continues to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services, and video, as well as December quarter records in the App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies, and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher. Turning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do key work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by a core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and the rest of Asia-Pacific and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging comparisons for iPad and Wearables, Home, and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and returned to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is at an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch comparison and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Macs, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000-plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

A record gross margin implies your higher margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter?

As mentioned, we saw an 11% increase, reaching $23.1 billion, which is a record for us, with significant achievements in The Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. This growth was widespread across all geographic regions and robust across all Services categories, as we set revenue records in cloud, payments, video, advertising, as well as records for the App Store and AppleCare in the December quarter. It\u2019s important to note that last year included an extra week, making our underlying performance stronger than the reported 11%. The entire ecosystem is thriving, as reflected in the growth of both transacting accounts and paid accounts, both of which are critical metrics. Our paid subscriptions are continuing to grow at a strong double-digit rate, and we have surpassed one billion paid subscriptions across all service platforms, more than double what we had just four years ago, marking significant growth. Regarding the March quarter, I indicated during my prepared remarks that we expect to maintain a similar double-digit growth rate as we did for the December quarter.

We saw strong results in several regions, setting all-time records in Europe and the Asia-Pacific. We performed particularly well in emerging markets, including Latin America and the Middle East, and set records for the December quarter in India and Indonesia. There has been a fantastic response to the iPhone, with an all-time high for iPhone upgraders and the installed base reaching a new record. Additionally, iPhones accounted for four of the top five smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan, four of the top six in urban China and the UK, and all five in Australia. Customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 reached 99%.

It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions, but just wondering how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time and which Apple products adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar?

And we are incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that want to check it out. And so, we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product and it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning. All the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so, we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store tomorrow and see the reaction myself.",

Among the changes are alternate billing options, different app stores, and our marketplaces. We are also enabling NFC for new banking and wallet app capabilities. These are some of the measures we've introduced. Over the years, we have focused on privacy, security, and usability. We have made every effort to retain the features that users love about our ecosystem, but we will inevitably be limited in what we can offer due to regulatory compliance.

So, I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, where there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component, obligations that you've put in place, let's say, a year ago, and that flowing through.

So, obviously, a very significant increase. I would say the two primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course, it's the biggest quarter of the year for us, so we get the leverage effect. We had a partial offset, negative impact from foreign exchange. But net-net, obviously, very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also, in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so, the combined effect of the two businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.",

Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that your capital expenditures have actually come down this last year. I'm curious as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for generative AI, kind of platform as we move forward?

First, for Luca, can you clarify whether the $5 billion impact in the March quarter pertains to product revenue or total company revenue? Additionally, you mentioned strong gross margins. While I understand some commodity costs were deflationary last year, it appears they are becoming inflationary now. Also, considering the Mac silicon conversions you've made, I'm trying to determine how much more potential there is to improve gross margins. I will follow up with Tim afterward.",

A year ago, we encountered supply disruptions for the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max due to factory shutdowns caused by COVID-19. Consequently, there was pent-up demand that was fulfilled as we moved out of the December quarter, and we also addressed channel fill during the March quarter. The nearly $5 billion I mentioned is entirely related to the iPhone. Regarding gross margins, we are currently at very high levels and I've reiterated that we have experienced good expansion over the past few quarters. We are now projecting gross margins of 46% to 47%, which considers the commodity environment, foreign exchange conditions, and our product and services mix. The result of this is strong guidance, which we are pleased with.",

And historically, Apple has been a consumer-centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Mac, it's sort of penetrating more into the enterprise. I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future? Would it still be consumer-centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise-focused also as we get into the future?

That if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so, it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple, because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well. iPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with a million apps and 600 plus that have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of Enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of Enterprise in a long time. And so, I think there's a potential fit for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of the iPhone. I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.",

You discussed China, but what are you observing in that market with the carriers in the States? Is the sales cycle or the replacement cycle extending? What do you believe needs to change to potentially re-accelerate business in the Americas, especially in the iPhone segment? Also, I want to clarify the guidance. Considering the $5 billion pull forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I account for it this quarter or back it out from the last, the March quarter appears to be the softest since the COVID pandemic. I understand the Americas is a bit softer than China, as you clarified, but how do you perceive the macro conditions by region? Do you think we're approaching a trough in macro demand, or how long do you anticipate this weakness will last? Thank you.",

Measuring the replacement cycle is quite challenging at any given time. Internally, we concentrate on the active install base and sales over typical cycles, and we have a positive outlook on these metrics. In terms of market performance, the iPhone accounts for four out of the top five best-selling smartphones in the U.S., and customer satisfaction is remarkably high at 99%.

          "content": "Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $90.8 billion and an EPS record of $1.53 for the March quarter. We set revenue records in more than a dozen countries and regions. These include, among others, March quarter records in Latin America and the Middle East, as well as Canada, India, Spain and Turkey. We also achieved an all-time revenue record in Indonesia, one of the many markets where we continue to see so much potential. In services, we set an all-time revenue record, up 14% over the past year. Keep in mind, as we described on the last call, in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish iPhone channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter COVID-related supply disruptions on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. We estimate this one-time impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter revenue last year. If we remove this from last year's results, our March quarter total company revenue this year would have grown. Despite this impact, we were still able to deliver the records I described. Of course, this past quarter, we were thrilled to launch Apple Vision Pro and it has been so wonderful to hear from people who now get to experience the magic of spatial computing. They describe the impossible becoming possible right before their eyes and they share their amazement and their emotions about what they can do now, whether it's reliving their most treasured memories or having a movie theater experience right in their living room. It's also great to see the enthusiasm from the enterprise market. For example, more than half of the Fortune 100 companies have already bought Apple Vision Pro units and are exploring innovative ways to use it to do things that weren't possible before, and this is just the beginning. Looking ahead, we're getting ready for an exciting product announcement next week that we think our customers will love. And next month, we have our Worldwide Developers Conference, which has generated enormous enthusiasm from our developers. We can't wait to reveal what we have in store. We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in Generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon. We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy, which underpins everything we create. As we push innovation forward, we continue to manage thoughtfully and deliberately through an uneven macroeconomic environment and remain focused on putting our users at the center of everything we do. Now let's turn to our results for the March quarter across each product category, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue for the March quarter was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year. We faced a difficult comparison over the previous year due to the $5 billion impact that I mentioned earlier. However, we still saw growth on iPhone in some markets, including Mainland China, and according to Kantar during the quarter, the two best-selling smartphones in Urban China were the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro Max. I was in China recently where I had the chance to meet with developers and creators who are doing remarkable things with iPhone. And just a couple of weeks ago, I visited Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore, where it was incredible to see all the ways customers and communities are using our products and services to do amazing things. Everywhere I travel, people have such a great affinity for Apple, and it's one of the many reasons I'm so optimistic about the future. Turning to Mac. March quarter revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% from a year ago. We had an amazing launch in early March with the new 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The world's most popular laptop is the best consumer laptop for AI with breakthrough performance of the M3 chip and it\u2019s even more powerful neural engine. Whether it's an entrepreneur starting a new business or a college student finishing their degree, users depend on the power and portability of MacBook Air to take them places they couldn't have gone without it. In iPad, revenue for the March quarter was $5.6 billion, 17% lower year-over-year, due to a difficult comparison with the momentum following the launch of M2 iPad Pro and the 10th Generation iPad last fiscal year. iPad continues to stand apart for its versatility, power and performance. For video editors, music makers and creatives of all kinds, iPad is empowering users to do more than they ever could with a tablet. Across Wearables, Home and Accessories, March quarter revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% from a year-ago due to a difficult launch comparison on Watch and AirPods. Apple Watch is helping runners go the extra mile on their wellness journeys, keeping hikers on course with the latest navigation capabilities in watchOS 10, and enabling users of all fitness levels to live a healthier day. Across our watch lineup, we're harnessing AI and machine learning to power lifesaving features like regular rhythm notifications and fall detection. I often hear about how much these features mean to users and their loved ones, and I'm thankful that so many people are able to get help in their time of greatest need. As I shared earlier, we set an all-time revenue record in services with $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year. We also achieved all-time revenue records across several categories and geographic segments. Audiences are tuning in on screens large, small and spatial and are enjoying Apple TV+ Originals like Palm Royale and Sugar. And we have some incredible theatrical releases coming this year, including Wolves, which reunites George Clooney and Brad Pitt. Apple TV+ productions continue to be celebrated as major awards contenders. Since launch, Apple TV+ productions have earned more than 2,100 award nominations and 480 wins. Meanwhile, we're enhancing the live sports experience with a new iPhone app, Apple Sports. This free app allows fans to follow their favorite teams and leagues with real-time scores, stats and more. Apple Sports is the perfect companion for MLS Season Pass subscribers. Turning to retail, our stores continued to be vital spaces for connection and innovation. I was delighted to be in Shanghai for the opening of our latest flagship store. The energy and enthusiasm from our customers was truly something to behold. And across the United States, our incredible retail teams have been sharing Vision Pro demos with customers, delighting them with a profound and emotional experience of using it for the very first time. Everywhere we operate and everything we do, we're guided by our mission to enrich users' lives and lead the world better than we found it, whether we're making Apple podcasts more accessible with a new transcripts feature or helping to safeguard iMessage users' privacy with new protections that can defend against advances in quantum computing. Our environmental work is another great example of how innovation and our values come together. As we work toward our goal of being carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030, we are proud of how we've been able to innovate and do more for our customers while taking less from the planet. Since 2015, Apple has cut our overall emissions by more than half, while revenue grew nearly 65% during that same period. And we're now using more recycled materials in our products than ever before. Earlier this spring, we launched our first-ever product to use 50% recycled materials with a new M3-powered MacBook Air. We're also investing in new solar and wind power in the U.S. and Europe, both to power our growing operations and our users' devices. And we're working with partners in India and the U.S. to replenish 100% of the water we use in places that need it most, with the goal of delivering billions of gallons of water benefits over the next two decades. Through our Restore Fund, Apple has committed $200 million to nature-based carbon removal projects. And last month, we welcomed two supplier partners as new investors, who will together invest up to an additional $80 million in the fund. Whether we're enriching the lives of users across the globe or doing our part to be a force for good in the world, we do everything with a deep sense of purpose at Apple. And I'm proud of the impact we've already made at the halfway point in a year of unprecedented innovation. I couldn't be more excited for the future we have ahead of us, driven by the imagination and innovation of our teams and the enduring importance of our products and services in people's lives. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the March quarter was $90.8 billion, down 4% from last year. Foreign exchange had a negative year-over-year impact of 140 basis points on our results. Products revenue was $66.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to the challenging compare on iPhone that Tim described earlier, which was partially offset by strength from Mac. Thanks to our unparalleled customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who are new to our products, our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and all geographic segments. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.9 billion, up 14% year-over-year with record performance in both developed and emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.6%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by cost savings and a favorable mix to services, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 36.6%, down 280 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by seasonal loss of leverage and mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74.6%, up 180 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.4 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 5% year-over-year. Net income was $23.6 billion, diluted EPS was $1.53 and a March quarter record, and operating cash flow was strong at $22.7 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% year-over-year, due to the almost $5 billion impact from a year ago that Tim described earlier. Adjusting for this one-time impact, iPhone revenue would be roughly flat to last year. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the March quarter, we saw many iPhone models as the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey, an iPhone was the top-selling model in the U.S., Urban China, Australia, the U.K., France, Germany and Japan. The iPhone 15 family continues to be very popular with customers. 451 Research recently measured customer satisfaction at 99% in the U.S. Mac revenue was $7.5 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our new MacBook Air, powered by the M3 chip. Customers are loving the incredible AI performance of the latest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. Our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of our MacBook Air buyers during the quarter being new to Mac. Customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the U.S. iPad generated $5.6 billion in revenue, down 17% year-over-year. iPad continued to face a challenging comparison against the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and iPad 10th Generation from last year. At the same time, the iPad installed base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high as over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. The latest reports indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for iPad in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $7.9 billion, down 10% year-over-year due to a difficult launch comparison. Last year, we had the continued benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch installed base to a new all-time high and customer satisfaction was recently measured at 95% in the U.S. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $23.9 billion, growing 14% year-over-year with our installed base of active devices continuing to grow at a nice pace. This provides a strong foundation for the future growth of the services business as we continued to see increased customer engagement with our ecosystem. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over $1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. We continued to improve the breadth and quality of our current services from creating new games on Arcade and great new shows on TV+ to launching additional countries and partners for Apple Pay. Turning to enterprise, our customers continued to invest in Apple products to drive productivity and innovation. We see more and more enterprise customers embracing the Mac. In Healthcare, Epic Systems, the world's largest electronic medical record provider, recently launched its native app for the Mac, making it easier for healthcare organizations to transition thousands of PCs to the Mac for clinical use. Since the launch of Vision Pro last quarter, many leading enterprise customers have been investing in this amazing new product to bring spatial computing apps and experiences to life. We are seeing so many compelling use cases from aircraft engine maintenance training at KLM Airlines to real-time team collaboration for racing at Porsche to immersive kitchen design at Lowe's. We couldn't be more excited about the spatial computing opportunity in enterprise. Taking a quick step back, when we look at our performance during the first half of our fiscal year, total company revenue was roughly flat to the prior year in spite of having one less week of sales during the period and some foreign exchange headwinds. We were particularly pleased with our strong momentum in emerging markets, as we set first-half revenue records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, the Middle East, India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey. These results, coupled with double-digit growth in services and strong levels of gross margin, drove a first-half diluted EPS record of $3.71, up 9% from last year. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $162 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $3.2 billion in maturing debt and commercial paper was unchanged sequentially, leaving us with total debt of $105 billion. As a result, net cash was $58 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $23.5 billion through open-market repurchases of $130 million Apple's shares. Given the continued confidence we have in our business now and into the future, our Board has authorized today an additional $110 billion for share repurchases, as we maintain our goal of getting to net cash-neutral over time. We are also raising our dividend by 4% to $0.25 per share of common stock, and we continued to plan for annual increases in the dividend going forward as we've done for the last 12 years. This cash dividend will be payable on May 16, 2024, to shareholders of record as of May 13, 2024. As we move ahead into the June quarter, I'd like to review our outlook. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our June quarter total company revenue to grow low-single-digits year-over-year in spite of a foreign exchange headwind of about 2.5 percentage points. We expect our services business to grow double-digits at a rate similar to the growth we reported for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect iPad revenue to grow double-digits. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% to 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

As you know, on the CapEx front, we have a bit of a hybrid model where we make some of the investments ourselves. In other cases, we share them with our suppliers and partners on the manufacturing side, we purchased some of the tools and manufacturing equipment. In some cases, our suppliers make the investment. On the data center side, we have our own data center capacity and then we use capacity from third parties.

Commodities go in cycles and there's obviously always that possibility. Keep in mind that we are starting from a very high level of gross margins. We reported 46.6%, which is something that we haven't seen in our company in decades. We're starting from a good point. As you know, we try to buy ahead when the cycles are favorable to us.

That's before any kind of normalization for the supply disruption that we mentioned earlier. If you look at the top-selling smartphones, the Top 2 in Urban China are iPhones. While I was there, it was a great visit and we opened a new store in Shanghai and the reception was very warm and highly energetic, so I left there having a fantastic trip and enjoyed being there. I maintain a great view of China in the long term. I don't know how each and every quarter goes and each and every week. But over the long haul, I have a very positive viewpoint.",

I wouldn't say anything other than that. I've said that before. I believe that was last quarter as well.

Is it really this AI initiative that a lot of companies are pursuing? Do you think that changes sort of the demand drivers going forward?

There are enormous numbers of different verticals. Our focus is on growing that ecosystem and getting more apps and more and more enterprises engaged.

Today, Apple is reporting a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% from a year ago and better than we had expected. EPS grew double digits to $1.40 and achieved a record for the June quarter. We also set quarterly revenue records in more than two dozen countries and regions, including Canada, Mexico, France, Germany, the UK, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand. And we set an all-time revenue record in services which grew 14%. At our Worldwide Developers Conference, we were thrilled to unveil game-changing updates across our platforms, including Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence builds on years of innovation and investment in AI and Machine Learning. It will transform how users interact with technology, from writing tools to help you express yourself, to image playground, which gives you the ability to create fun images and communicate in new ways, to powerful tools for summarizing and prioritizing notifications. Siri also becomes more natural, more useful, and more personal than ever. Apple Intelligence is built on a foundation of privacy, both through on-device processing that does not collect users' data and through private cloud computing, a groundbreaking new approach to using the cloud, while protecting users' information powered by Apple silicon. We are also integrating ChatGPT into experiences within iPhone, Mac, and iPad, enabling users to draw on a broad base of world knowledge. We are very excited about Apple Intelligence and we remain incredibly optimistic about the extraordinary possibilities of AI and its ability to enrich customers' lives. We will continue to make significant investments in this technology and dedicate ourselves to the innovation that will unlock its full potential. Recently, we've also been excited to bring Apple Vision Pro to more countries, giving customers the chance to discover the remarkable capabilities of this magical device. Vision Pro users are customizing their own workspaces, watching movies on 100-foot screens, and exploring entire worlds with just a pinch of their fingertips. With more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for Vision OS, the developer community continues to pioneer stunning spatial experiences that are only possible with Vision Pro. Last month, we announced that we're bringing some amazing new immersive content to Vision Pro, including new series, concerts, films, and more. And we've seen great interest for Vision Pro in the enterprise, where it can empower companies large and small to pursue their best ideas like never before. With each innovation, we're unlocking new ways of working, new ways of learning, and new ways of tapping into the unlimited promise of human potential. We are doing that across every product and every service. Now let me share more detail in our June quarter results, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, we grew compared to last year. Customers continue to praise the iPhone 15 lineup for its incredible battery life, exceptional cameras, and unmatched power and performance. And we are excited to bring incredible new features to the iPhone with iOS 18, making it more personal, capable, and intelligent than ever before. This update includes the biggest redesign of the Photos app, new customization options for the home screen, messages over satellite, and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. Apple Intelligence utilizes the power of our most advanced iPhones, the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, offering a transformative set of capabilities. Mac revenue was $7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Customers are loving the latest M3-powered 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air. With back-to-school season upon us, MacBook Air is the perfect companion for students on campus and small business owners, developers, and creatives of all kinds depend on Mac to do more than they ever could before. Powered by Apple silicon with its neural engine and privacy built in at the chip level, Macs are simply the best personal computers for AI. And every Mac we've shipped with Apple silicon since 2020 is capable of taking advantage of Apple Intelligence with Mac OS Sequoia. We also know the importance of security for our users and enterprises so we continue to advance protections across our products. Turning to iPad, revenue was $7.2 billion, 24% higher year-over-year. During the quarter, we had an incredible launch where we unveiled the all-new 11 and 13-inch iPad Air, the perfect device for education, entertainment, and so much more. And with the new iPad Pro, we pushed the boundaries of power-efficient performance with the remarkable M4 chip, the engine behind this incredibly thin device. By leveraging the latest in Apple silicon, Video Editors and Musicians can take advantage of the cutting-edge AI features in Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro. And we're very excited that iPad Pro and iPad Air models powered by the M series of Apple silicon will be able to utilize the powerful capabilities of Apple Intelligence. In wearables, home, and accessories, revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% from a year ago. Apple Watch is empowering users to live a healthier day with a range of tools to take charge of their wellness journeys. At the core of Apple Watch, are powerful AI features that are helping users get help when they need it most, from irregular heart rhythm notifications to walking steadiness to crash detection and fall detection. I've heard time and again how meaningful these features are for users and their loved ones, and their stories motivate us to keep pushing forward on this vital work. As I mentioned earlier, in services, we set an all-time revenue record of $24.2 billion with paid subscriptions climbing to an all-time high. We achieved revenue records in the majority of the services categories with all-time revenue records in advertising, cloud, and payment services. Apple TV+ productions are delighting audiences on screens large and small. We're sharing powerful works of imagination with series and movies like Presumed Innocent, the Upcoming Disclaimer, and The Instigators starring Matt Damon. And we can't wait for returning fan favorites with new seasons of The Morning Show, Slow Horses, and Severance. Apple TV+ productions also continue to earn accolades with nearly 2,300 nominations and 500 wins to date. That includes 72 Emmy Award nominations across 16 programs, our best-ever showing for the upcoming awards event. During the quarter, we also expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets including Japan, Canada, Italy, and Germany, enabling more businesses to use the power of iPhone to accept contactless payments. And we announced new updates to our services coming this fall, including US national park hikes and custom walk routes and Apple Maps, the ability to pay with rewards using Apple Pay, collaborative listening with Apple Music, and a redesigned Apple Fitness+ experience to help users make the most of our library of workouts and meditations. Turning to retail, we continue to expand in emerging markets with our first-ever location in Malaysia. Customers from all over the country came together with our team members to celebrate this special moment. Elsewhere in the world, our teams have been sharing the magic of Apple Vision Pro and demos that delight, inspire, and deeply move customers exploring the wonders of spatial computing for the first time. At the heart of all of our innovations are the values that guide everything we do. We believe fundamentally that the best technology is technology that works for everyone. And in honor of Global Accessibility Awareness Day, we introduced all-new capabilities to give users more ways to take advantage of all our products can do. These include eye tracking for users to control iPhone or iPad visually, music haptics to give those who are deaf or hard of hearing a tangible way to experience music, and vocal shortcuts that tie tasks to a user's voice. And we are committed as ever to shipping products that offer the highest standards of privacy for our users. With everything we do, whether it's offering a browser like Safari that prevents third parties from tracking you across the internet or providing new features like the ability to lock and hide apps, we are determined to keep our users in control of their own data. And we are just as dedicated to ensuring the security of our users' data. That's why we work to minimize the amount of data we collect and work to maximize how much is processed directly on people's devices, a foundational principle that is at the core of all we build, including Apple Intelligence. And we continue to make significant progress on the environment. We are proud to say that all of our data centers, including those that will run private cloud compute, operate on 100% renewable energy. At Apple, we're constantly accelerating our pace of innovation. We are a company in relentless pursuit of big ideas. Time and again, we've seen how a spark of creativity can reach breakthrough velocity, reach across previously unexplored dimensions, and ultimately take flight in ways that can change the world. It's why we're going to keep investing in the meaningful innovation that enriches the lives of all of our customers. We have a busy time ahead of us, and I couldn't be more excited for all the amazing things yet to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon everyone. We are very pleased to report a new June quarter revenue record of $85.8 billion, up 5% year-over-year, despite 230 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact. We achieved growth in the vast majority of our markets, with June quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $61.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to our unmatched levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year, with an all-time record in developed markets and a June quarter record in emerging markets. Company gross margin was 46.3% near the high end of our guidance range and down 30 basis points sequentially driven by a different mix within products which was partially offset by a favorable mix shift towards services and cost savings. Products gross margin was 35.3%, down 130 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by mix, partially offset by favorable costs. Services gross margin was 74%, down 60 basis points from the last quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the low end of the guidance range we provided and up 7% year-over-year. Net income was $21.4 billion and diluted EPS of $1.40 was up 11% year-over-year and set a June quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $28.9 billion, also a June quarter record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $39.3 billion, down 1% year-over-year but grew on a constant currency basis. We set June quarter records across several countries, including the UK, Spain, Poland, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Philippines. And the iPhone Active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the June quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, urban China, the UK, Germany, Australia, and Japan. Customer satisfaction on the iPhone 15 family continues to be extremely high, with 451 Research measuring it at 98% in the US in their latest reports. Mac generated $7 billion in revenue, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. We saw particularly strong performance in our emerging markets, with June quarter records for Mac in Latin America, India, and South Asia. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high with half of MacBook Air customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And customer satisfaction for Mac was recently reported at 96% in the US. iPad revenue was $7.2 billion, up 24% year-over-year, driven by the launch of the new iPad Pro and iPad Air. Customers are loving the latest iPad lineup for its new design and display, unparalleled performance, AI capabilities, and much more. The iPad install base has continued to grow and is at an all-time high, as half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, home, and accessories revenue was $8.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year, a sequential acceleration from the March quarter. Watch and AirPods continue to face a difficult compare against prior year launches of the AirPods Pro second-generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. Apple Watch continues to attract new customers, with almost two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product, sending the Apple Watch install base to a new all-time high. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicate a customer satisfaction of 97% for watch in the US. In services, total revenue reached an all-time record of $24.2 billion, growing 14% year-over-year. We continue to have great momentum in services, as the growth of our installed base of active devices sets a strong foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. We see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. And we are constantly focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services. From critically acclaimed new content on Apple TV+ to new games on Apple Arcade and the many latest features we previewed during WWDC for iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Music, and more. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see businesses leveraging our entire suite of products to drive productivity and creativity for their teams and customers. USAA, a leading insurance and financial services company, recently expanded beyond their existing iPhone and iPad deployments to provide their employees with the latest MacBook Air. And American Express has continued to add to their fleet of over 10,000 Macs to enhance their employees' productivity, security, and collaboration. We're also excited to see leading organizations such as Boston Children's Hospital and Lufthansa using Apple Vision Pro to build innovative spatial computing experiences to transform the training of their workforces. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $153 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $4.3 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving us with total debt of $101 billion. As a result, net cash was $52 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $32 billion to shareholders, including $3.9 billion in dividends and equivalents and $26 billion through open market repurchases of 139 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the September quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect foreign exchange to continue to be a headwind and to have a negative impact on revenue of about 1.5 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. We expect our September quarter total company revenue to grow year-over-year at a rate similar to the June quarter. We expect services revenue to grow double digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the first three quarters of this fiscal year. We expect gross margin to be between 45.5% and 46.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.2 billion and $14.4 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on August 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.",

So can you maybe just share color on the China market as a whole how much you believe promotions helped in the quarter, how sustainable this improvement is, and if this performance really changes any of your approach to the China market as we look forward.

This shows that over 50% of the decline is related to currency fluctuations, which is an improvement from the first half of the fiscal year, and we are pleased to see this acceleration. Specifically for iPhones in Greater China, the installed base has reached a record high, and in Mainland China, we set a June quarter record for upgraders. This is a strong indication, and data from Kantar this quarter shows that the top three smartphone models in urban China were iPhones. Additionally, when we compare the 15 family of iPhones to the 14 family from the same launch period starting September 2023, the 15 is performing better. We are particularly focused on attracting new customers, and in Mainland China, most customers purchasing Macs and iPads are first-time buyers, with a significant majority of Apple Watch buyers also new to our products. Furthermore, iPad sales returned to growth in Greater China, as they did globally. We maintain our confidence in the long-term opportunities in China, even though we cannot predict every detail of the future.",

We launched significant products like the iPad during the quarter, but saw some offset from a shift towards Services, along with good cost savings. Year-over-year, our margins are up significantly. It's important to note that foreign exchange continues to pose some challenges. For the September quarter, we are guiding for a range of 45.5% to 46.5%, consistent with the guidance from last quarter. We expect a slightly different mix and anticipate minimal sequential impact from foreign exchange, though it will be more significant year-over-year. Regarding commodities, we've noted some increases in memory prices, but overall, other commodity prices are declining.

The installed base growth is very important of course because we have a larger pool of customers that uses the ecosystem and uses our Services. We are seeing and we've seen this consistently for many, many quarters now. We see continued growth in the level of engagement that our customers have with our ecosystem. We have more transacting accounts every quarter, so more people using the ecosystem both the free elements of the ecosystem and the paid elements. We see paid accounts growing double digits, and we've seen that for many, many quarters. Now we look at our paid subscriptions on our platform, and they are growing strong double digits as well. So obviously, the growing level of engagement helps us both from an ARPU standpoint and just a volume standpoint. Obviously, as you've seen over the last several years, we launched new services over time, and we've launched many new services fairly recently. Obviously, our payments business is relatively new, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Fitness+, so many other services we've added. And so we are providing more and more opportunities for our customers to interact with the ecosystem. And we believe we are doing also a very good job at improving the breadth and quality of these services and improving the amount of content that we make available. We continue to make significant investments on TV+, on Apple Arcade. We are launching new shows, new games all the time. And I think you will continue to see that as we go forward. We are very, very happy with the 14% growth that we had this quarter because particularly if you look at the performance that we had in Services a year ago, the compares for us tend to get a bit more challenging in the second half of our fiscal year. But in spite of that, we delivered a level of growth that was better than what we were expecting at the beginning of the quarter.",

When we think about that, is the incremental headwind, I mean there was FX headwinds throughout the last several years.

It's also important to remember that within the Products business, our products have varying margin profiles, and the relative success of our products in the marketplace can affect their gross margins. Thus, the product mix influences gross margins, which we need to monitor closely. We recently launched an iPad, which is one of the factors in play, but we aim for all our products to succeed in the market. That's why we prioritize gross margin dollars first, with gross margin percentage typically following. Additionally, the state of the commodity markets significantly impacts our margins and typically follows cyclical patterns.

Do you see the rollout of these features requiring further increases in R&D or increases in OpEx or CapEx for cloud compute capacity? And is it even possible to forecast the Services usage as they roll out, given that they are so new for consumers? Thanks.",

Of course, an improvement in the top-line helps the margin expansion that we've had over the last several years and several quarters obviously has helped. And so that is driving better operating cash flow. On the CapEx front as Tim said, we employ a hybrid model. Some of the investments show up on our balance sheet and some other investments show up somewhere else and we pay, as we go. But in general, we try to run the company efficiently. We continue to think that capital efficiency is a good thing. And therefore, we are pleased with the fact that our free cash flow is doing well this year.",

          "content": "Thank you, Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $94.9 billion, a September quarter record and up 6% from a year ago. iPhone grew in every geographic segment, marking a new September quarter revenue record for the category, and Services set an all-time revenue record, up 12% year-over-year. We also set September quarter segment revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and the Rest of Asia Pacific, as well as in a large number of countries, including the United States, Brazil, Mexico, France, the UK, Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. And we continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we're seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. This has been an extraordinary year of innovation at Apple. We brought the revolutionary Apple Vision Pro to customers in February, which brings users tomorrow's technology today. And in June, we announced Apple Intelligence, a remarkable personal intelligence system that combines the power of generative models with personal context to deliver intelligence that is incredibly useful and relevant. Apple Intelligence marks the beginning of a new chapter for Apple innovation and redefines privacy and AI by extending our groundbreaking approach to privacy into the cloud with Private Cloud Compute. Earlier this week, we made the first set of Apple Intelligence features available in US English for iPhone, iPad, and Mac users, with systemwide Writing Tools that help you refine your writing, a more natural and conversational Siri, a more intelligent Photos app, including the ability to create movies simply by typing a description, and new ways to prioritize and stay in the moment with notification summaries and priority messages. And we look forward to additional intelligence features in December, with even more powerful Writing Tools, a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration, as well as localized English in several countries, including the UK, Australia, and Canada. These features have already been provided to developers and we're getting great feedback. More features will be rolling out in the coming months, as well as support for more languages, and this is just the beginning. Now, I'll turn to our results for the quarter, beginning with iPhone. iPhone revenues set a September quarter record of $46.2 billion, up 6% from a year ago, with growth in every geographic segment. With the introduction of Apple Intelligence, we're beginning a new era for iPhone. iPhone 16, powered by A18, is equipped with an incredible new 48-megapixel Fusion camera, fantastic photo experiences, and the addition of the action button and camera control. An iPhone 16 Pro is the most advanced iPhone we've ever made, powered by A18 Pro and featuring even larger displays, an industry-leading pro camera system with camera control, and studio quality mics, all with a huge leap in battery life. Turning to Mac, revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% from a year ago. Just this week, we brought a new generation of Apple Silicon to Mac, M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max. From blazing fast performance to Apple's most advanced neural engine yet, our latest chips can easily tackle incredibly complex workflows, and they ensure our newest Macs will be the best personal computers for AI the instant they hit stores. With the newest additions to our Mac lineup, customers can choose the Mac that's just right for them, whether that's iMac, the world's best and most beautiful all-in-one; MacBook Air, the world's most popular laptop now with double the starting memory; MacBook Pro, the best Pro notebook anywhere; or the incredible, mighty new Mac mini, our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac. iPad revenue was $7 billion, 8% higher year-over-year. iPad is unlike any other product on the market today, and it's become an essential device in homes, schools, and businesses of all sizes. Recently, we were thrilled to introduce the newest iPad mini, featuring an ultra-compact design built for Apple Intelligence with support for Apple Pencil Pro. It's been a big year for iPad. iPad Air was popular with students and teachers as they got back to school this year, while creators are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with the M4-powered iPad Pro. In Wearables, Home, and Accessories, revenue was $9 billion, down 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we launched the all-new Apple Watch Series 10, bringing a beautiful new design and new capabilities to the world's most popular watch that make it even more powerful, intelligent, and sophisticated. It's the thinnest Apple Watch yet, making it more comfortable than ever, while offering the biggest, most advanced display. watchOS 11 brings some huge new health and fitness insights to users, including sleep apnea notifications, which help to alert people with a potentially serious but often undiagnosed condition. We're proud of the impact we make through our health innovations on watch, and I'm grateful for every note I receive about the importance of watch in people's lives. With AirPods 4, we broke new ground in comfort and design with our best-ever open-ear headphones available for the first time with active noise cancellation. And we were especially pleased to unveil revolutionary end-to-end hearing health capabilities for AirPods Pro 2 with hearing protection, hearing tests, and hearing aid features. These just became available in a software update this week, and we believe this will make a meaningful difference in our users' lives. I've already started getting notes from customers calling the experience life-changing. And Apple Vision Pro continues to deliver spatial experiences that weren't possible before, including immersive entertainment like the new short film, Submerged, which gives people a view into the unique storytelling power made possible by spatial computing. Vision Pro has more than 2,500 native spatial apps and 1.5 million compatible apps for visionOS 2, as well as applications companies are building to reimagine how they work. Vision Pro continues to inspire awe in its users, and we're just scratching the surface of what's possible. And just yesterday, we announced we're bringing Vision Pro to Korea and the UAE. As I mentioned earlier, Services achieved an all-time revenue record of $25 billion, up 12% from a year ago, and with all-time revenue records across most of our categories. With Apple TV+, we love celebrating the craft of great storytellers who know how to put on a show. Audiences love to discover new movies like Wolfs, explore acclaimed new series like Disclaimer, and dive back into returning favorites like Slow Horses and Shrinking. Apple TV+ productions have become fixtures at award shows, earning more than 2,300 nominations and more than 500 wins today. Apple also offers a live sports experience in a league of its own with MLS Season Pass, and subscribers have been cheering on their favorite teams in the MLS Cup playoffs. This month, we also marked 10 years of Apple Pay. There's always something magical about being able to buy groceries or pay for movie tickets seamlessly with your Apple device. Today, users choose Apple Pay for purchases across tens of millions of retailers worldwide. And we're excited to make the Apple Pay experience even better, with the option to redeem rewards and access loans from credit cards, debit cards, and other lenders right at checkout. Whenever we celebrate big moments, Apple Stores are the best places to share them with customers. I had an incredible time during launch day in September alongside our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where energy and enthusiasm filled the air. And in stores all over the world, customers are eager to get a closer look at our latest innovations. We also opened two new stores during the quarter and we can't wait to bring four new stores to customers in India. We're passionate about education and believe technology has a vital role to play in both helping teachers to inspire their students and students to learn about the world around them. In honor of World Teachers' Day, Apple was proud to share new resources for teachers to engage their students in ways that aim to make learning easy and fun. Additionally, we've expanded our education grant program into 100 new schools and communities, helping with everything from access to technology, to educator resources, to scholarships and financial support. As we near the end of the year, we're proud of the progress we've made in our efforts to be carbon-neutral across our entire footprint by the end of the decade. As I mentioned earlier, we were thrilled to introduce our first-ever carbon-neutral Mac with the latest Mac mini. And in another milestone, customers can choose a carbon-neutral option of any Apple Watch. These achievements are amazing for all of us at Apple, and we are determined to reach our 2030 goal. At Apple, across everything we do, we manage for the long term, because we're always thinking about what comes next, the next great challenge, the next innovative idea, the next big breakthrough. As we close out the year, we have the best lineup we've ever had going into the holiday season, including Apple Intelligence, which marks the start of a new chapter for our products. This is just the beginning of what we believe generative AI can do, and I couldn't be more excited for what's to come. Before I hand it over to Luca, with Luca transitioning to a new role with Apple, this will be the final time he's joining our call. So, I just wanted to take a moment to recognize his extraordinary service as Apple's CFO and to thank him for his partnership. I am deeply grateful. In his 10 years in the role, Luca has done truly exceptional work in shaping Apple as we know it today. He has helped manage Apple for the long term, thoughtfully and deliberately. He has helped us enrich the lives of so many around the world, and he has been a leader that people look up to and have learned so much from. I have incredible confidence in our incoming CFO, Kevan Parekh, and we look forward to more of you meeting and working with him going forward. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.",

          "content": "Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you, Tim, for the very kind words. Serving as Apple's CFO has been a real privilege and an amazing journey, and I've greatly appreciated the support from our investors and the analyst community over the years. Kevan is exceptional, and I know you will enjoy interacting with him going forward. Let me now turn to the results for the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We're very pleased to report a new September quarter revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We grew in the vast majority of the markets we track and achieved September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and Rest of Asia Pacific. Products revenue was $70 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by growth in iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Our installed base of active devices reached an all-time high across all products and geographic segments, thanks to very high levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a large number of customers who are new to our products. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year. We saw broad-based strength around the world, reaching all-time records in both developed and emerging markets with double-digit growth and record results across most services categories. Company gross margin was 46.2%, near the high end of our guidance range. Products gross margin was 36.3%, up 100 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by favorable mix. Services gross margin was 74%, unchanged from the prior quarter. Operating expenses of $14.3 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided at the beginning of the quarter and up 6% year-over-year. During the quarter, we recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, which relates to the impact of the reversal of the European General Court's State Aid decision. When we exclude this one-time charge, net income was $25 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.64, up 12% year-over-year and a September quarter record. Operating cash flow was very strong at $26.8 billion, a new September quarter record. Let me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $46.2 billion, up 6% year-over-year, and a September quarter record in total and across several markets, including the US, the Middle East, Korea, and South Asia. The iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high in total and in every geographic segment. During the September quarter, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world. In fact, according to a survey from Kantar, iPhone was the top-selling model in the US, Urban China, the UK, Australia, and Japan. We continue to see high levels of customer satisfaction for the iPhone 15 family, with 451 Research recently measuring it at 98% in the US. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, up 2% year-over-year, driven by the strength in MacBook Air. Customers have been loving the performance of Apple Silicon on Mac, and we are very excited to bring the latest M4 family of chips to the lineup. The Mac installed base reached an all-time high, with about half of customers in the quarter being new to Mac. And in the latest reports from 451 Research, customer satisfaction was 95% in the US. iPad generated $7 billion in revenue, up 8% year-over-year. In addition to growth in developed markets, we also saw strong performance in many emerging markets, with double-digit growth in Mexico, Brazil, the Middle East, India, and South Asia. The iPad installed base reached another all-time high, and over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Also, customer satisfaction was recently measured at 97% in the US. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue was $9 billion, down 3% year-over-year. The Apple Watch installed base reached a new all-time high, with over half of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product. And the latest reports from 451 Research indicated customer satisfaction of 96% for watch in the US. Our Services revenue reached an all-time record of $25 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. Services continue to see strong momentum with the growth of our installed base of active devices setting a solid foundation for the future expansion of our ecosystem. And we see increased customer engagement with our services offerings. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Paid subscriptions also grew double-digits. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number we had only four years ago. And as always, we remain focused on improving the breadth and quality of our services from new games on Apple Arcade to new features like Tap to Cash and to pay with installments using Apple Pay to many successful new and returning shows on Apple TV+. This past quarter, we celebrated the five-year anniversary of Apple Card, which was ranked #1 in customer satisfaction among co-branded credit cards by J.D. Power for the fourth year in a row. Turning to enterprise, we continue to see strong demand across our products and services. NVIDIA launched its Mac as a choice program supported by AppleCare for Enterprise and Apple Professional Services with over 10,000 Macs deployed worldwide. And Novartis, a leading global pharmaceutical company, recently chose iPhone 16 as the standard mobile device for all employees. We also see continued momentum with Apple Vision Pro in the enterprise space. UC San Diego Health is the first hospital in the world to test spatial computing apps on Apple Vision Pro in clinical trials for patient surgery in the operating room. Let me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $157 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.6 billion in maturing debt and increased commercial paper by $7 billion, leaving us with total debt of $107 billion. As a result, net cash was $50 billion at the end of the quarter. During the quarter, we returned over $29 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. As we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we're providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect our December quarter total company revenue to grow low- to mid-single digits year-over-year. We expect Services revenue to grow double-digits at a rate similar to what we reported in the fiscal year 2024. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $15.3 billion and $15.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around negative $250 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark to market of minority investments. And our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock payable on November 14, 2024, to shareholders of record as of November 11, 2024. With that, let us open the call to questions.",

There's also email summaries and email priority. We're getting a lot of positive feedback from developers and customers. And in fact, if you just look at the first three days, which is all we have obviously from Monday, the 18.1 adoption is twice as fast as the 17.1 adoption was in the year-ago quarter. And so, there's definitely interest out there for Apple Intelligence. Carrying on in the quarter, we are looking forward to bringing even more features in December, and this will include even more powerful Writing Tools and visual intelligence experiences that build on Apple Intelligence, and ChatGPT integration in addition to other features, as well as we'll bring localized English to several countries that include the UK, Australia, and Canada. So, it's going to be quite a software quarter between the release on Monday and the release in December. And then, as we turn the corner to '25, we'll have more languages rolling out, starting in April as well and more features as well. And so, it's a very strong drumbeat, and we couldn't be more excited about it.",

Tim, maybe if we start with you, I think each of the last four years you've exited the December quarter with iPhone demand outpacing supply. As we look to this quarter in the iPhone 16 cycle, lead times are relatively short. There are no known supply shortages. And I'm just curious whether you've been able to maybe get a better read on early cycle iPhone demand this year relative to past years. And if so, what you've learned about upgrade rates, switching rates, trade-ups versus trading down and being more price sensitive? And overall, any impact that Apple Intelligence may have on iPhone 16 sales? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you.",

We just launched it three days ago, and the data shows that version 18.1 has double the adoption rate of 17.1, indicating strong interest. About exiting the December quarter with demand exceeding supply, I don't remember that happening in all four of the past years. We did experience disruptions during COVID that affected our supply, but in a normal environment without extreme circumstances, we aim to balance supply and demand as quickly as possible. We don't want customers to wait for products. This year, we quickly achieved balance with the iPhone 16 and the 16 Pro models. Although we had constraints in October, we believe those issues will be resolved soon, which is encouraging for us. It's important to note that this situation is influenced by both supply and demand, and we have been preparing for this quarter for quite some time.",

There's plenty of debate in the market right now about input costs and commodity prices, and the impact that will have on gross margins. Historically, you do guide gross margins up 50 basis points sequentially, which you just told us about for the December quarter. So, can you maybe just help us understand your view of component prices and broadly whether you still see those as tailwinds to gross margins and how sustainable that tailwind might be, or whether that should become a headwind as we look forward?

We are very pleased with the level of gross margins that we've reported during the course of the year. The entire fiscal year of '24, they\u2019re really, for our company, record levels of gross margin, and obviously guiding to 46% to 47% for the December quarter with all the new technologies that we've included in the products and with all the new features that Tim has talked about, a lot of new products across the board, I think it's a very good sign.",

Additionally, our active device installed base reached a record high. We also had the top two selling smartphones in Urban China, according to Kantar. More than 50% of new customers are purchasing products like Mac and iPad, and over 75% of watch buyers are new to the product. These are some positive indicators.

Keep in mind, our definition of Europe in our segment reporting includes a number of emerging markets, like Turkey, where we've grown very strongly, the Middle East. Tim mentioned a number of records in Saudi, in UAE, and we also include India where we set an all-time revenue record during the September quarter. But I have to say also Western Europe grew nicely.

And if that's the risk, is that more iPhone-related, Mac-related, given the strength that you've seen in iPad related?

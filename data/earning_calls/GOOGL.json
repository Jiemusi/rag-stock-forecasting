          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Over the last few months, guided by our mission, we continue to develop helpful technologies with a view towards empowering both people and businesses. Even as more people return to in-person activities, we are seeing hybrid approaches to learning and working are here to stay, and our products are helping partners seize these new opportunities. To help support our own flexible work plans, this year, we plan to invest approximately $9.5 billion in our U.S. offices and data centers, creating at least 12,000 new Google jobs in the U.S. in places like New York and Atlanta. To enable our long-term growth, we are investing in areas like Cloud, AI, YouTube, Search, and beyond. In 2020 and 2021 combined, we invested $40 billion in research and development in the U.S. Beyond the U.S., we have announced new office investments in London and Warsaw and a new product development center in Nairobi. We are excited for the product development they will support. We'll share more about these investments at Google I/O, our annual developer conference on May 11, and I encourage you to tune in. Turning now to product highlights. AI continues to be at the heart of our core search and information products. We launched multisearch in Google Search this quarter. It's a new way people can find what they need using both images and words. For example, you can snap a photo of a shirt pattern and then type the word green to find a green shirt with that pattern. We also shared new features in Search to help people find healthcare providers who take their insurance and book appointments online. With ads automation, search ads powered by AI are helping our customers quickly respond to the market conditions most relevant to their business. Philipp will discuss this in more detail. Let's move to YouTube. We continue to support our community of creators, advertisers, and viewers. With over 2 billion monthly signed-in users, we are well positioned to do this. YouTube, over the past 2 years, has seen significant growth and has become a central destination for entertainment, learning, and educational content. And even as people have returned to in-person activities, time spent on YouTube has continued to grow. Just as YouTube evolved from desktop to mobile, and that created huge opportunities, we are excited about the new opportunities we see now. Short-form video is one. YouTube Shorts is now averaging over 30 billion daily views. That's 4 times as much as a year ago. In the first quarter, we added new capabilities to video editing, and we are continuing to invest in making Shorts a fantastic experience for creators and viewers alike. As we've always done with products, we focus on building a great user experience first, and we will work to build monetization over time. The living room is another area of opportunity. On average, viewers are watching over 700 million hours of YouTube content on televisions every day. And in the year ahead, we will give YouTube's connected TV viewers new smartphone control navigation and interactivity features, allowing people to comment and share content they are watching on television directly from their devices. Turning next to our computing platforms. A few weeks ago, we marked a big milestone, our 100th release of Chrome and Chrome OS. Over the years, we have worked with developer and OEM partners to improve speed, simplicity, and security and move the web forward. It's a great example of what we mean when we say we are building for the long term. And on Android, we'll showcase at I/O the many helpful features and services that Android and its platforms provide. Over the coming years, we will continue to invest in new form factors, seamless multidevice experiences, and raising the bar for user privacy while giving developers the tools they need to succeed on mobile. As you know, we have made changes to our Google Play pricing model to help all developers on our platform succeed. Today, 99% of developers qualify for a service fee of 15% or less. While this impacted our short-term results, we think it's the right long-term approach to support the ecosystem and to be the most developer-friendly app store and gaming platform available. We are also exploring alternative billing options. And as we do this, we'll continue to uphold high safety standards that protect personal data and sensitive financial information. Earlier today, we launched the data safety section in Play, where people can access more information about how apps collect, share, and secure their data. In hardware, Pixel 6 is a huge step forward for the Pixel portfolio, and it's been great to see the response from Pixel users. It's the fastest-selling Pixel ever, and we are building broad consumer awareness of the brand and making good progress. I'm excited about the products we have coming and look forward to sharing more at Google I/O. Next, on to Cloud, where Q1 revenue grew 44% year-over-year with continued strong performance across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We continue to deliver differentiated products across four distinct areas. First, cybersecurity, where we introduced new offerings, including Assured Workloads to address digital sovereignty in the European Union; Virtual Machine Threat Detection, a first-to-market agentless malware detection capability; an advanced intrusion detection system for network threat detection. Organizations like T-Mobile and DoorDash are protecting their critical systems and data with Google Cloud's trusted cybersecurity products. These include Security Command Center, which helps many companies, including UKG, Ultimate Kronos Group, and Ocado Group, monitor and manage their security posture and risk. Our leading threat detection and response platform, Chronicle, is now paired with Siemplify to more quickly automate incident detection and resolution. We also announced our intent to acquire Mandiant, a leader in dynamic cyber defense and response, to help protect customers from the most advanced threats. Second, we continue to evolve a leading data cloud with serverless Spark to run batch Spark workloads; BigLake, a new storage engine that unifies data warehouses and lakes; and Dataplex, which provides unified management and governance of data across data warehouses and lakes. Our unified data cloud and AI platform is helping organizations like KeyBanc, LG Electronics, and Macy's work intelligently with data across multiple clouds. BigQuery, our leading solution for analytics, is helping customers like Kraft Heinz, Mercado Libre, and Vertabelo to help create more personal consumer experiences. BT Group, UPS, and other leading brands continue to tap our deep expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to power their organizations. This includes our Contact Center AI platform, which helped The Home Depot improve their call containment by 185%, creating a more positive customer support experience. We are proud to share that more than 700 technology partners power their applications with our data cloud. Third, our open secure infrastructure remains a differentiator as it enables customers to run their workloads and apps where they need them. This is winning global brands like Dun & Bradstreet, Boeing, and Kyocera. Our product leadership continued with the release of Tau VMs, which powers price performance that's more than 40% better than any other leading cloud; and Google Distributed Cloud Edge, a new edge solution designed to run telecommunication networks at scale, which is helping Bell Canada evolve its 5G network. And we further expanded our regional footprint globally. Leading companies like Mahindra are choosing us for large-scale IT transformations and migrating their data centers to Google Cloud, while Sony's Crunchyroll uses our infrastructure and networking capabilities to power the largest anime streaming service in the world. Our scalability enables Ninja Van, the leading logistics provider in Southeast Asia, to handle more than 10 times their normal traffic during peak times. Finally, we continue to advance Google Workspace. To support hybrid work, we recently introduced new collaboration features, including bringing Google Meet directly into Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides. You can now see and hear your team as you collaborate in real time without the need to schedule meetings. Google Meet can now live stream to up to 100,000 people who can also participate in Q&A and polls. We also launched the next wave of innovation in Google Docs with smart canvas, including auto-generated summaries and pageless format in Docs, smart chips, and automating workflow using Gmail. Smart canvas has seen very rapid uptake with more than 6 million checklist and 6 million smart chips being added to documents each week. These innovations are helping employees adapt to hybrid work at large enterprises like Equifax and Ocean Network Express, digital natives including Flipkart, and organizations like the University of Alberta. Finally, our Other Bets. This month, Waymo became the first company to run fully autonomous ride-hailing operations in multiple locations simultaneously. Today, employees can take rider-only trips in San Francisco, joining the growing number of public Waymo One riders in Phoenix. Wing launched its on-demand drone deliveries in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In the first quarter of 2022, Wing completed over 50,000 commercial deliveries. That's up more than 3 times year-over-year. As you know, sustainability continues to be a big focus for us. In addition to our own ambitious goals to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030, we recently joined Frontier, a new coalition with Stripe and many others, jointly committing more than $900 million to accelerate carbon removal solutions. Before I close, we remain deeply concerned about the war in Ukraine and the humanitarian crisis unfolding in the region. While I was in Warsaw, Poland last month, I met with many leaders across Central and Eastern Europe to reaffirm our commitment to the region. We are finding ways for our products and platforms to be helpful, including enhanced features on Search to help refugees find resources. Across all these efforts, I feel inspired by the ways that our teams at Google work to help people in moments big and small. With that, let me thank Googlers everywhere for their contributions this quarter. Over to you, Philipp.",

          "speaker": "Philipp Schindler",
          "title": "CRO",
          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. As always, it's great to be with you all. I want to start by echoing Sundar. The war in Ukraine and the deepening humanitarian crisis across the region is heartbreaking. As with our response during the global pandemic, we remain focused on how we can help, whether it's air raid alerts on Android phones to help Ukrainians get to safety, refugee centers live on Maps or new attributes that let hotels share if they're offering free or significantly discounted accommodations for those in need or whether it's helping via Insights, which enabled Ukraine's largest person-to-person marketplace, OLX Ukraine, to pivot its product strategy nearly overnight to help people find essential products and services. Let's take a quick look at our performance this quarter before we dive into the trends that drove it. In Google Services revenues, we were pleased with the growth in the first quarter, up 20% year-over-year. Retail was again the largest contributor to year-on-year growth of our ads business in Q1, followed by travel. Speaking of travel, people are seemingly back on the move, whether they're searching for planes, passports, or their next vacation destination. Q1 travel searches were above Q1 2019 prepandemic levels. Query growth in categories like beaches and islands were up 27% versus 2019, while vacation rentals rose 37%. Compared to last year, global searches for passports online jumped 80%, while searches for travel insurance surged 2 times. We continue to launch new tools to help travel partners reconnect with customers and to help users find the trusted info they need to plan their next trip. In March, free hotel booking links expanded to Search and Maps. Travel partners can extend their reach. Users get a more comprehensive set of options. And earlier this month, we made it possible for hoteliers to easily share their rates and availability directly on Google via Business Profile. Let's talk Performance Max, our newest AI-powered campaign that allows businesses to harness the best of automation to drive the most optimal performance across all Google Ads inventory. Since launching globally in November, Performance Max has seen strong customer adoption, particularly among smaller businesses. Performance Max's simplicity shows how we're moving from a model in which businesses needed to understand the complex language of campaigns, keywords, CPC, and so on to a model where we understand the company's goals and actively help them achieve their business objectives. Take ASSIST CARD, a leading LatAm travel assistance company who first tested Performance Max to accelerate its recovery in Argentina. Initial tests to drive sales yielded a 40% lower cost per acquisition at a 15 times higher conversion rate versus other campaigns with the same goals. Early success led ASSIST CARD to rapidly expand Performance Max to 9 other countries, including Brazil, Spain, and the U.S., and significantly increased spend on the new format in 2022. Moving on to retail, where we had another strong quarter. Consumers are finding a new balance between online and in-person. Google Maps searches for shopping near me were up 100% globally year-over-year. People want to buy from brands that provide a seamless experience wherever and whenever they prefer to shop. For local businesses and big box retailers alike, this remains a big opportunity. Omnichannel is still a winning strategy. We're continuing our investments to make shopping on Google as effortless, delightful, and engaging as possible. With rich, more immersive content, including more visual and browsable results for apparel and fashion searches and new advancements like multisearch in Google Search, which launched in beta for shopping queries earlier this month, we're helping people go beyond the search box to search anywhere and any way. Take AR beauty, which is still in its early days, but a great example of the innovative and cool experiences we're building to benefit both users and brands. Shoppers can now virtually discover and try on thousands of products from 90-plus brands, including Maybelline New York, MAC, and Charlotte Tilbury as well as from retailers like Ulta Beauty right in Google Search. Let's move on to YouTube. Our brand business had a strong quarter. However, we did see more modest growth in direct response. For brand, we're enthusiastic about what's ahead for connected TV. Brands are turning to us to tap into the shift to streaming and reach new audiences in smarter and more efficient ways. Over 135 million people in the U.S. were reached via YouTube on connected TVs in December. We've recently rolled out new tools to help advertisers consistently plan and measure their connected TV spending across platforms. And later this year, in partnership with Nielsen, we'll help brands directly compare their YouTube reach to linear TV, including the ability to measure co-viewing. This apples-to-apples comparison will be a game changer in helping advertisers make smarter investment decisions. According to Nielsen, in the U.S., YouTube accounts for over 50% of ad-supported streaming watch time on connected TVs among people ages 18 and up. And over 35% of viewers in this group can't be reached by any other ad-supported streaming service. In other words, we're seeing that when users choose to watch ad-supported connected TV, they choose to watch YouTube, and YouTube delivers connected TV audiences that advertisers can't reach elsewhere. Brands are taking notice, like Warner Bros., who leaned on YouTube to help drive awareness among key audiences for The Batman. By using a combination of best-performing video creative, connected TV media, and video ad sequencing, Warner Bros. expanded its target audience in the 2 weeks leading up to its release, helping contribute to its successful $134 million opening weekend. For direct response, we continue to believe there's great opportunity to address commercial intent on YouTube between video action campaigns, app campaigns, product feeds, and new live commerce features. As Sundar mentioned, Shorts is another area we're really excited about. Engagement is strong, and we're focused on delivering great experiences for users, creators, and advertisers. In fact, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and video action campaigns. While it's still early days, we're encouraged by initial advertiser feedback and results, which brings me to our partners and how we're closely collaborating with them to grow and evolve healthier, sustainable ecosystems and bring them the best of Google. We continue to focus on accelerating growth in India's digital ecosystem and are excited about our expanding partnerships with several partners in the region. Then Sundar mentioned Sony's Crunchyroll. Beyond Cloud, we're working across Android, Google Play, Google TV, and more to help Sony and Crunchyroll acquire and retain more users and fans and strengthen its leadership in the direct-to-consumer anime streaming market. As always, I want to extend deep appreciation to our customers and partners for their collaboration and trust and to our product, engineering, partnership, sales, and many support teams. Thank you. Your relentless focus on helping our users, customers, and partners makes our success possible. Now over to Ruth.",

          "title": "CFO",
          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. We had a strong first quarter with revenue growth led again by Search and Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $68 billion, up 23% or up 26% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $29.6 billion, up 23%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.6 billion, up 22%. The biggest factors here were costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by content acquisition costs, primarily driven by costs for subscription content and then costs for YouTube's advertising-supported content. Operating expenses were $18.3 billion, up 24%. Headcount growth was the primary driver of expenses across all three categories: research and development, sales and marketing, and G&A. Growth in sales and marketing also reflects an increase in advertising and promo expense as we ramped back from the lower levels of spend last year. Operating income was $20.1 billion, up 22%. Our operating margin was 30%. Other income and expense was a loss of $1.2 billion, which was driven by unrealized losses in the value of investments in equity securities given market volatility. Net income was $16.4 billion. We again delivered substantial free cash flow with $15.3 billion in the quarter and $69 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $134 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repurchased a total of $52 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in the last 12 months. Let me now turn to our segment financial results, starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.5 billion, up 20%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.6 billion in the quarter were up 24%, led again by retail, followed by continued recovery in travel. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.9 billion were up 14%, reflecting ongoing strong growth in brand and more modest growth in direct response. The deceleration in the year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping the exceptional performance of direct response that we called out in the first quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.2 billion were up 20%, driven by AdSense and AdMob. Other revenues were $6.8 billion, up 5%. The growth rate reflects substantial growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube Music and Premium and YouTube TV, which were largely offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, primarily as a result of the pricing changes that we've discussed with you previously. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12 billion, up 23%. Google Services operating income was $22.9 billion, up 17%. And the operating margin was 37%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $5.8 billion for the first quarter, up 44%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $931 million. As to our Other Bets for the first quarter, revenues were $440 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. We're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter, which reflect the benefit of investments we've made over many years. We remain committed to investing to continue to build helpful technologies in support of long-term growth notwithstanding the uncertainty in the global outlook. The most visible reflection of our focus on long-term performance is our continued investment in talent and compute capacity across the company. In terms of outlook by segment for Google Services, the revenue growth rates we delivered in 2021 in our advertising businesses benefited from lapping the COVID-related weakness in 2020. Obviously, we will not have that tailwind for the rest of this year. As discussed in prior calls, the largest impact from COVID on our results was in the second quarter of 2020, which means that in the second quarter of 2022, we will face a particularly tough comp as we lap the recovery we had in the second quarter of 2021. Additionally, the second quarter results will continue to reflect that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia. Within other revenues, in the first quarter, the substantial growth in YouTube subscription revenues was offset by a decline in Play revenues versus the first quarter last year due to the fee changes we previously announced. These fee changes will continue to affect our results throughout 2022 until we lap the introduction of the changes. Turning to Google Cloud. Cloud's performance in the first quarter reflects growing deal volume and strength across multiple industries and regions. Customers are increasingly choosing Google Cloud to help them digitally transform their businesses using our global infrastructure offerings, our data analytics and AI capabilities, and the collaboration benefits of Workspace. We continue to invest aggressively in Cloud given the sizable market opportunity we see. At the Alphabet level, reported revenues in the first quarter reflect that the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year, with a 3-point headwind in Q1 compared with a 2-point tailwind in the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter, the impact from foreign exchange rates will have an even greater impact on year-over-year comparisons given both the larger tailwind last year and the increase we expect in the headwind in Q2 versus Q1 based on current spot rates. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 7,400 people in the first quarter, and the majority of hires were for technical roles. The biggest increases in headcount this quarter across product areas were again in Cloud for both technical and sales roles. Turning to CapEx. The investment in the first quarter reflects the timing of closing for several large acquisitions of office facilities, which converged in the first quarter. More specifically, of the total, nearly $4 billion covers the purchases in New York, London, and Poland that we had mentioned previously. We continue to expect a meaningful increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally, with servers as the largest component. As stated in our press release today, our Board has authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $70 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in a manner that's in the best interest of the company and its stockholders. Thank you. And now Sundar, Philipp, and I will take your questions.",

Also, what has been your observation regarding growth in the overall Search business so far this quarter? Secondly, Philipp, thank you for the details on Performance Max. Can you discuss the strategic timeline for achieving broader adoption of these tools within your sales teams? Should we expect this to take months, quarters, or years?

This growth reflects the strength we've observed in retail, as mentioned by Philipp and me. Looking ahead, I should note that the revenue growth rates we achieved in 2021 in Search and across our advertising sectors benefited from overcoming the challenges posed by COVID in 2020. A key point to emphasize is that we won\u2019t have that advantage for the remainder of the year. Specifically, Q2 of 2020 experienced the most significant impact from COVID, which means we will face a challenging comparison in the second quarter of 2022. Additionally, our second quarter results will continue to be influenced by the suspension of most of our commercial activities in Russia and the effects of foreign exchange. Overall, we feel optimistic about our business efforts, and there are a few key points I wanted to highlight.",

By the way, just today, we announced new features for Performance Max, including new customer acquisition goals and new campaign-level insights. More details about the one-click upgrade tool for Smart Shopping and Local campaigns. So we're very, very committed to helping Performance Max deliver for our advertisers and have been very open to advertiser feedback on how we can do this.

I would say the most important, as both Sundar and Philipp said, is what a tragic humanitarian crisis this is. And across Google, we're doing a lot to provide support. In terms of revenues, the most direct impact is the fact that we suspended the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia, as we announced in early March. And to your question, about 1% of Google revenues were from Russia in 2021, and that was primarily from advertising. In addition, from the outset of the war, there was a pullback in advertiser spend, particularly on YouTube in Europe. So a couple of impacts from the war.",

Shorts went global, rolled out to over 100 countries, and as Sundar mentioned, now has 30 billion daily views, which is 4 times higher than a year ago. If we take the creator view, we're taking a fresh look at what it means to monetize Shorts and reward creators for their short videos. The first step, I think, is our $100 million YouTube Shorts Fund, which is now available in over 100 countries globally. Over 40% of creators who will receive payment from the Shorts Funds in 2021 weren't in the YouTube Partner Program, just as an interesting number. And then on the advertiser view side, as I mentioned earlier, we're testing ads on Shorts with products like app install and video action campaigns and are encouraged by the early results. All in all, I think we're deeply committed to supporting the next generation of mobile creators here on YouTube, and we're actively working on what monetization could look like in the future.",

Just curious if that dynamic continued in Q1. And then if you can comment at all on just how you think about the sustainability of those dollars going forward. And then, Ruth, in terms of spending and on the margin side, operating margins continue to be strong at 30% even with the greater headcount of the past couple of quarters. Just hoping you could elaborate a little bit on what you mean by considered investments and in what areas are you able to offset and gain more efficiencies in the business.",

And then in terms of overall margins and how we're thinking about investing, what I tried to make clear is we do continue to plan to invest aggressively this year. I made that point in my opening comments with respect to both ongoing hiring at a rapid clip as well as ongoing investment in technical infrastructure. I would say in terms of margins, we do remain focused on investing for long-term value creation. And as we noted, last year, in 2021, our margins did benefit from substantial revenue growth while at the same time, expense growth ramped more gradually during the year. In certain respects, as we talked about last year, margins benefited from what I described as a bit of a timing difference between revenue growth and expense growth. And there were two other benefits worth calling out that we talked about last year that affected operating margin. The first was the impact from the change in useful lives that we called out last year, and that benefited the year-on-year growth in expenses last year. The second was the impact of foreign exchange, which was a tailwind last year, but as I noted, has really flipped to a headwind given the strength of the U.S. dollar. The main thing is, the key point, we are very focused on long-term value creation. And in our view, given the opportunities we see, there are some key investments that we're continuing to make.",

Has that been a little bit of a headwind for growth as you ramp that up, and we can try to guess on monetization later?

In terms of the deceleration in the year-on-year revenue growth rate relative to the first quarter, the largest factor was lapping an exceptionally strong quarter in direct response, as we noted last year. In addition to that direct response lapping, there were a couple of other items worth noting. First, as I've already mentioned, the war that did have an outsized impact on YouTube ads relative to the rest of Google. That was both from suspending the vast majority of our commercial activities in Russia as well as, as I noted earlier, the related reduction in spend primarily by brand advertisers in Europe. In addition, as we mentioned on the third quarter earnings call, we continue to experience a headwind from ATT primarily in direct response. The dollar impact from ATT has been consistent since it was implemented in April of last year. And then there's the FX headwind I've already commented on. I would say to the other part of your question, we're experiencing a slight headwind to revenue growth as Shorts viewership grows as a percentage of total YouTube time. We are testing monetization on Shorts, and early advertiser feedback and results are encouraging. The team is focused on closing the gap with traditional YouTube ads over time. So we're excited about the new opportunities with Shorts, but it's a slight headwind.",

People are creating content on YouTube at a very active rate. We're really pleased with what we see there, and our team does remain focused on innovating and helping creators grow.

Just to give you a number, in 2021, the number of YouTube channels that had made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year-over-year. We're heavily investing in Shorts, in connected TV, and shopping. You heard the stats from Sundar on the 30 billion daily views.

The sizable delta between fixed and floating really reflects the meaningful strengthening of the dollar versus the euro. I guess to the heart of your question with respect to APAC, the main thing there is to take you back to a year ago. We were lapping a substantial 39% growth rate in constant currency. This reflects lapping that sizable growth relative to more muted ad performance in APAC this first quarter. It really takes you just back to last quarter.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm proud of how our teams continue to build helpful products and experiences for people and partners. Reflecting this, our performance in Search in the second quarter was strong. We are also seeing momentum in Cloud. With an uncertain global economic outlook, our strategy to invest in deep technology and computer science to build helpful products for the long term is the right one. Our ability to take the long view stems from our timeless mission, to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. At Google I/O in May, I talked about two key ways we move that mission forward, advancing both knowledge and computing. Those goals are at the heart of what we do. We know that our services are particularly helpful to people and businesses during uncertain moments, whether it's using Search or YouTube to find anything from anywhere or highly efficient tools like Search Ads that help businesses of all sizes reach customers or Google Cloud, which helps companies adapt to hybrid work and find efficiencies. We'll continue to invest in areas like AI, Search, and Cloud, and we'll do it responsibly and in a way that is responsive to the current environment. Earlier this month, I announced that we'll be slowing our hiring and sharpening our focus as a company. We are focused on hiring engineering, technical, and other critical roles. And we are working to improve productivity and ensure that the great talent we do hire is aligned with our long-term priorities. Turning now to product highlights. Years ago, we made a big bet on AI. We believe that it would be transformational for our business and for the world. We are still in the early days, yet AI already underpins many of our most helpful products and services. For example, AI is helping us create entirely new ways to search. People are using Google Lens to do visual searches more than 8 billion times per month. A new feature called multisearch helps people find what they need using words and images at the same time. Later this year, multisearch will be able to help people find local results near them. AI is also helping improve translation. With the new monolingual approach to translation, we've added 24 new languages to Google Translate, spoken by 300 million people. And a new immersive view in Maps uses computer vision, AI, and billions of images to create high fidelity representations of places around the world. Beyond AI, we are also seeing a new frontier with augmented reality. We have been testing exciting prototypes in our labs like the device we shared at Google I/O that puts real-time translation and transcription in your line of sight. It's one example of how AR can solve real needs in the real world. And last week, we announced that we will soon begin early testing of AR prototypes in real-world scenarios. Our goal is to learn how they can help people in their everyday lives. Our investments in commerce are another way we deliver helpful experiences. People are shopping across Google more than 1 billion times each day. We see hundreds of millions of shopping searches on Google Images each month. Merchants will soon be able to submit 3D images of their products to appear directly on Google Search. So customers can try before they buy. We're also focused on bringing together hardware, software, and AI in a range of helpful devices. At I/O, we announced great new products, including Pixel 6A, Pixel Buds Pro, and Pixel Watch. We are currently taking preorders for Pixel 6A and Pixel Buds Pro. It's been great to see the positive feedback so far. And on platforms, I'm proud that Android remains the world's most popular operating system with more than 3 billion monthly active devices worldwide. Last year alone, consumers activated 1 billion Android phones. We are making it easier for Android users to share photos and communicate with friends and family with a modern messaging standard called Rich Communication Services or RCS. Across our platforms and beyond, we keep more people safe online than anyone else in the world. Safe browsing on Chrome browsers helps protect billions of people every day by warning them when they try to access dangerous sites or files. Earlier this year, we rolled out a new machine learning model that identifies more than twice as many potentially malicious sites and phishing attacks as the previous model, helping to contribute to a safer and more secure web. We've also unified our password managers across Chrome and Android. Now stored passwords can be grouped and protected across devices, apps on the web. Taking a closer look at YouTube. YouTube Shorts are watched by over 1.5 billion signed-in users every month with more than 30 billion daily views. In Q2, YouTube TV surpassed 5 million subscribers, including trailers. There's also a lot of potential for shopping on YouTube. Just last week, we announced a partnership with Shopify; It will help creators easily connect their stores to YouTube and enable shopping across their live streams and videos. There's more to come here. Moving on to Cloud, which surpassed a $6 billion quarterly revenue mark for the first time. Q2 revenue grew to $6.3 billion, with momentum across Google Cloud Platform and Workspace. We saw continued demand in all geographies with global brands like Target in North America, H&M Group in Europe, Banco BV in Latin America, and BioPharma in Asia. We launched Google Public Sector in June, expanding our commitment to help U.S. government agencies and public institutions accelerate their digital transformations from New York State and Arizona State University to the U.S. Forest Service and the state of Rhode Island. Customers are choosing Google Cloud as their technology partner because of our leadership in four areas. First, we continue to lead in the data cloud market because we unify data lakes, data warehouses, data governance, and advanced machine learning into a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Companies like S.C. Johnson, Northwell Health, and the Golden State Warriors choose Google Cloud for our strength in data analytics. Our capabilities helped Swiss Air optimize its flight operations. They're also helping Engie explore ways to optimize wind energy management and other organizations to create smarter factory floors. Second, companies like BetaBank and Mayo Clinic choose their open cloud infrastructure to modernize their IT systems on our cloud at the edge or in their data centers. Our infrastructure scales to help customers like Deutsche Telekom modernize its network, Wipro to modernize its core systems, and Garvan Institute of Medical Research to process 14,000 genomes in under two weeks. Our multi-cloud strategy remains a differentiator for customers like Elevance Health, formerly known as Anthem, and AMD. Third, cybersecurity. Google has always provided a secure cloud infrastructure, and we continue to introduce new cybersecurity products that help customers detect, protect, and respond to a broad range of cybersecurity threats. Customers like GitLab, Highmark Health, and Iron Mountain protect their critical systems and data with our products. Carryable Coffee and Etsy are among the 5 million websites protected by our cybersecurity technology. Finally, Google Workspace's easy-to-use and secure communication and collaboration tools continue to be chosen by many organizations as they return to hybrid work. Google Workspace helped St. Luke's Medical Center, a leading healthcare system in the Philippines address a 38% increase in telehealth visits during the pandemic. Results like this are driving growth in many customer segments around the world, including digital natives like Canva, large enterprises like Travis Perkins plc, and public sector institutions, including the Central Dutch Government. Finally, our other bets. Waymo expanded rider-only testing with employees to include Downtown Phoenix and started testing at Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport. It also began charging trusted tested riders in San Francisco, a step closer to launching a commercial service with fully autonomous trips. Waymo also opened a new facility to support Waymo Via, their autonomous Class 8 trucking solution as they continue to increase their operations and investment across the Southwest region. Calico is testing an investigational drug treatment in patients with ALS, developed in collaboration with AbbVie. It's an early step of many in the development process. Wing recently surpassed 250,000 commercial deliveries and unveiled a series of delivery drone prototypes able to carry different sized packages. There is good progress here and we will continue to be intentional across the portfolio. To close, while the economic outlook is uncertain, it's been great to see people gathering in person again. We are pleased to see people coming back into the office more often, resulting in more opportunities for collaboration. It's a privilege to build technology that's helpful in both good times and uncertain ones. And I want to thank everyone at Alphabet and Google for their work and support of people, businesses, and all of our partners everywhere. Over to you, Philipp.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. It's always great to be with you all. As Sundar indicated, we're as focused as ever on helping businesses navigate complexity and operate from a position of confidence. AI-powered tools, insights, and automation are arming customers and partners with the ability to stay agile and responsive so they can capture short-term opportunities while also building for the long term. You've seen our own commitment to the long term in our latest innovation announcements at I/O, Google Marketing Live, and Brandcast. Sundar covered a number of these. I'll dive deeper into a few more, including how we're improving our advertiser experiences and building simpler, more useful products for our partners. Within Google Services, Search delivered strong revenue growth in the second quarter, driven by performance in both travel and retail. In travel, users' appetite continued to remain strong heading into the summer season. Searches for places to visit in summer were up 2x globally year-over-year, while searches for last-minute hotel deals were up 50%. However, as we've all seen in the news recently, the travel sector has been experiencing some challenges. As always, we're committed to helping our travel partners navigate this with insights and new tools. Then there's retail, where we had another solid quarter. At GML, we highlighted how we're continuing to innovate to help merchants make the most of how quickly consumer shopping is evolving, like Best Buy was embracing a full omnichannel approach from measurement to bidding to using omni ad formats across Google. By adopting omni across its local inventory ads portfolio and showcasing curbside and in-store pickup, Best Buy increased in-store revenue from Google Ads by 34% last year. Today's customers expect to shop wherever, whenever, and they care as much about local as they do about finding inspiration for the next purchase online. In Q2, searches for 'open now, near me' were up 8x globally year-over-year, while searches for designer outlets jumped 90%. We also saw strong interest in apparel categories like women's clothing and in beauty categories like perfume and fragrances. With AI-powered tools like Performance Max, which local and smart shopping campaigns will upgrade to in time for the holidays, we're helping businesses move at speed and scale to reach new and existing customers wherever they are in their shopping journey with relevant, useful content. We've seen strong momentum with P-Max. Advertiser adoption is up 5x year-to-date. Sustainable apparel brand, Rothy's drove a 59% increase in conversions and a 60% increase in revenue after turning to P-Max. By leveraging its creative assets and showing them at scale, Rothy's reached more customers in a way they hadn't been able to do before. Innovating across Search and YouTube also remain top priorities. Sundar mentioned new 3D AR features. Target and Wayfair are testing these to help customers see and shop products in real life. We launched new ad formats for more visual browsing search experiences. And then there's cool live commerce capabilities like live direct which let creators start a shopping live stream on their channel and then redirect viewers to a brand's channel for more. Let's dive deeper into YouTube. In the second quarter, the biggest factor in the year-over-year comparison was the lapping of a very strong second quarter in 2021 when we experienced a strong recovery from the impact of COVID in early 2020. Ruth will provide more details on this later on. As we continue to help advertisers manage through uncertainty, I would point out three key highlights for YouTube. First, Brandcast joined the upfronts in New York in May for the first time ever, a reflection of how digital and linear TV worlds are converging for both viewers and advertisers. As the #1 streaming video platform to reach viewers across all devices with billions of hours of video watched every day, YouTube remains well positioned to deliver the reach, results, and relevance that advertisers need. In fact, even in TV's biggest moments, YouTube is still delivering huge incremental reach. According to Comscore, 49.9% of adults that saw a Super Bowl ad on YouTube on the day of the Super Bowl did not see the ad on TV. And as more advertisers tap into connected TV, they're also driving results. According to Google Commission Nielsen meta-analysis of MMMs that measured YouTube CTV and TV across U.S. consumer packaged goods, on average, YouTube CTV effectiveness was 3.1x greater than TV. Take GSK Consumer Healthcare, now Haleon, who piloted CTV campaigns across its top 10 global markets to drive effectiveness at scale and tap into the shift to streaming. The results, 73% of campaigns drove substantial lift in brand and unbranded searches, and viewers were up to 14x more likely to search for Haleon related terms. Adding CTV to its existing plans also led to greater efficiencies and savings. Haleon has since opted its 2022-2023 investment and is now expanding CTV across LATAM and EMEA markets. Second, as Sundar said, our momentum in Shorts continues. Last quarter, we shared that we're in the early stages of testing monetization with ads, and we continue to be encouraged by the results so far. Third, there's full funnel, which we've covered before, and more advertisers are embracing. On average, YouTube advertisers using a full funnel strategy experienced 80% unique reach across brand and action campaigns. With this incremental reach across upper and lower funnel formats, advertisers meet different audiences based on where they are in the purchase journey. Estee Lauder Taiwan's recent campaign for its advanced night repair serum is a great example. Branded content collaboration with top creators raised awareness, while YouTube shopping shelf feature boosted consideration and to generate new leads and sales, a series of well-orchestrated action formats did the trick. This full funnel strategy drove 29% more unique visits to its website and a 95% increase in sales. With our performance products, advertisers can confront demand. With our massive reach products, they create net new demand at scale. Lastly, an update on how we're bringing the best across Google to our partners and key ecosystems. First, in gaming to help Bandai Namco entertainment drive immersive gaming experiences and build a more robust IP strategy. We're partnering across Cloud, Geo, Ads, YouTube, and more. And then there's news. Google News Showcase now has 1,500-plus partnerships with publications across 17 countries, including recent agreements with publications in the U.K., Romania, and Slovakia. I'll close, as I always do with gratitude for customers and partners and for Googlers across sales, partnerships, product engineering, and our many, many support teams. Thank you for your tireless commitment to making a positive impact around the world. Ruth, over to you.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the second quarter reflect strength in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.7 billion, up 13% or up 16% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $30.1 billion, up 15%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $17.9 billion, up 17%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations. Operating expenses were $20.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting the following: first, the increase in R&D expenses, which was driven primarily by headcount growth. Second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promotions followed by headcount growth. And finally, the growth in G&A, which reflects increases in both professional service fees and in head count, partially offset by a decline in charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $19.5 billion, flat versus last year, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $439 million. Net income was $16 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $12.6 billion in the quarter and $65 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $125 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $62.8 billion, up 10%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.7 billion in the quarter were up 14%, driven by both travel and retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.3 billion were up 5%. The modest year-on-year growth rate primarily reflects lapping the uniquely strong performance in the second quarter of 2021. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were up 9%, driven by AdSense. The quarter-on-quarter deceleration in both YouTube and network advertising revenues primarily reflects pullbacks in spend by some advertisers. Other revenues were $6.6 billion, down 1%, reflecting a year-on-year decline in Play, primarily driven by the fee changes we have discussed previously. We also saw a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $12.2 billion, up 12%. Google Services operating income was $22.8 billion, up 2%, and the operating margin was 36%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.3 billion for the second quarter, up 36%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by solid growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $858 million. As to our other bets for the second quarter, revenues were $193 million and the operating loss was $1.7 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. In terms of the Google Services segment, we are pleased with our performance in Search in the second quarter, which continued to deliver strong results. As a reminder, the 2022 revenue growth rates are presented against particularly tough comps as we lapped the recovery in the second quarter of 2021 from the impact of the pandemic in early 2020. Going forward, the very strong revenue performance last year continues to create tough comps that will weigh on year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues for the remainder of the year. In YouTube and Network, the pullbacks in spend by some advertisers in the second quarter reflects uncertainty about a number of factors that are challenging to disaggregate. Within other revenues in the third quarter, we expect an ongoing headwind from the fee changes and the slowdown in buyer spend that impacted results in the second quarter. Turning to Google Cloud. Customers are transforming their businesses, utilizing GCP's secure infrastructure with data, analytics, and AI capabilities, uncovering real-time insights and leveraging the collaborative tools of Workspace. They are in the early days of this transformation, and we continue to invest in our products, go-to-market capabilities, and cloud regions. In terms of foreign exchange, our second quarter results reflect the U.S. dollar strengthened versus last year from a significant tailwind last year to a 3.7 percentage point headwind in Q2. Looking to the third quarter, based on the strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. As a reminder, all segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. We provide fixed FX revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. In addition, as we've said previously, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. With respect to Alphabet head count, we added 10,108 people in the second quarter with the majority of hires for technical roles. Given the uncertain global economic outlook and the hiring progress achieved to date, as Sundar previously announced, we intend to slow the pace of hiring. We expect our actions on hiring to become more apparent in 2023. Our headcount additions in the third quarter will reflect we already have a strong number of commitments, including new graduate hires. As a reminder, we also expect the acquisition of Mandiant to close by the end of the year, which will further increase head count on top of hiring. Although we expect the pace of headcount growth to moderate next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent. Turning to CapEx. The largest investments in the second quarter were in servers followed by data centers and office facilities. After several large transactions closed in the first quarter, investment in office facilities was once again focused on fit-outs and ground-up construction on existing projects. We continue to expect an increase in CapEx in 2022 versus last year. For the balance of 2022, the increase will be particularly reflected in investments in technical infrastructure globally with servers as the largest component. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.",

Just wanted to get a sense of how that might change the investment profile in areas of priority for the company.

This also allows us to evaluate everything we do critically and reallocate resources to our most important priorities.

Our results have reflected lapping, continued to reflect lapping of the significant growth rates last year. On top of that, there is uncertainty in the global economic environment. And then, there are issues that differ across industry. You've seen it in the news for some; it's supply chain, for some it's inventory issues. So we will leave the forecasting to you and try to give you sort of the components as we went through Q2 here.",

After experiencing a slowdown in hiring through July, you've now reported a hiring pause. You mentioned that you\u2019re finding opportunities to optimize spending during this time. Can you discuss what you're observing in your business, particularly in advertising or cloud services, that drives the need for optimization? Are you noticing pullbacks, or is it more about reacting to macroeconomic news and wanting to take preemptive measures?",

However, there are common elements related to the macro environment that we are monitoring closely, and we aim to be more disciplined moving forward. This serves as an overarching theme. In terms of specific areas, I am primarily concentrating on identifying the right strategies with a long-term focus. I recognize that being in growth mode makes it difficult to consistently implement necessary adjustments, but moments like this provide an opportunity to do so. Therefore, I see this as a chance to sharpen our focus and capitalize on the current circumstances.",

And then when you look at the broader competitive landscape for video. How do you think about positioning YouTube, short-form video versus long-form video or enabling creators and businesses to have tools to build their businesses within YouTube? How do you think about product development and aligning the product against the broader competitive landscape?",

There was a lot in your question, so I'll start and then I'll pass it to Philipp. An obvious point as we're pointing out the lapping of what truly were extraordinary growth rates as time will get us through the lapping. So that's obvious math, but you asked the question. So starting with that. And then I did note that we have seen pullbacks in spend by some advertisers that, in fact, was the biggest factor in the quarter-on-quarter change, the sequential decline in the growth rate. And we do view that as rather idiosyncratic as I said, some of it is supply chain, some of it's inventory. And so just working through that. But again, it goes really to continuing to invest in YouTube and the experiences and the opportunity to deliver for our entire ecosystem; users, creators. And why don't I pass it to Philipp to maybe take you a step deeper into those.",

          "content": "Despite some advertisers pulling back, we strongly believe that YouTube is well positioned to capitalize on the shift to digital video, particularly for brand engagement. This year marked our first participation in the upfronts, which is exciting and highlights YouTube's evolution. We are pleased with our strong growth and commitments during this period. Advertisers recognize the value of YouTube's reach and its ability to deliver results. I mentioned connected TV earlier and, as I stated in our last call, we are enthusiastic about our future plans in that area. We are also continuing to offer advertisers unique and creative storytelling options and the ability to focus on specific key performance indicators, having recently introduced important measurement tools. On the direct response front, we believe there is still significant potential to address commercial intent on YouTube through video action campaigns, app campaigns, product feeds, and new live commerce features, where we are experimenting with various approaches. We are excited about the chances to connect brands with creators. Additionally, we are seeing advertisers utilizing YouTube at all levels of the marketing funnel, which I discussed earlier. This allows advertisers to effectively drive reach, relevance, and action, showcasing YouTube's strengths. Looking at the bigger picture, we remain optimistic about the innovation potential in branded direct response and across YouTube. I\u2019d also like to mention Shorts. We are witnessing an increase in the consumption of short-form videos, which is evident across various platforms, including YouTube. Sundar mentioned earlier that Shorts are being watched by over 1.5 billion logged-in users each month. Overall, we continue to observe strong user engagement on YouTube. In the last quarter, we noted that over the past two years, YouTube has experienced significant growth in watch time, even as people have resumed in-person activities. Time spent on YouTube globally has continued to rise. As I mentioned before, early results from Shorts' monetization are encouraging, and we are excited about the possibilities ahead.",

Ruth and Sundar, considering the strength of this company's balance sheet and profitability, I'm curious about your main priorities regarding your strategic focus. What factors are influencing your decision-making? Are you aiming for a specific margin or cash generation target? I\u2019m trying to understand the framework you\u2019re using to guide your efforts, especially in light of how other companies are pressured by their financial metrics. Now, for Philipp, I believe there\u2019s some concern regarding the composition of your advertising base. It seems like some other companies might have profited from growth among younger, less profitable businesses. Could you discuss what trends you're observing in your ad base? Is there any noticeable shift toward Fortune 500 companies that are investing more from a potentially stronger starting position? Any insights you can provide on the composition of your ad base would be helpful.",

To me, this is a long-term approach. We have established areas, like Search, where we've been doing this for a while. However, in our newer areas, we need to ensure that while we invest for the long term, we are also thoughtfully considering the business model, value creation, and profitability over time. These are the frameworks we utilize. It's crucial, regardless of the overall financial health of each area, that everything we develop is sustainable on its own, and that we remain disciplined.

Some of the operating margin upside last year was due to timing issues with the surge of revenues, and we indicated at the time there was a lag in part on some of the investments, whether that's data centers or otherwise. And so in part, you're seeing some of that. But very much to Sundar's point, the way we look at it is we are continuing to invest in long-term growth that has paid wonderful dividends for users and investors over the years. And we want to make sure we're doing it responsibly and judiciously. Some of these things pay out over the medium and longer term. And so as he said a couple of times now, this notion of wanting to look at what are meaningful investments to deliver continued extraordinary experiences for users and investors that then supports longer-term growth. It requires investments, and we just want to make sure that we're getting that balance right and that we're using resources effectively where we can to redeploy it and put it back into long-term investments.

It's a broad question you're asking, if you're leaning a little bit more towards the total addressable market here. Let me reiterate what I said before. We're not just addressing above-the-line marketing budgets, like traditional advertising or television advertising. There's a lot of upside that we've seen below the line, budgets, whether it's promotional pricing, product placements, sponsorships, and so on. That cuts across the universe of different players, sectors, verticals that I just described.

When I consider the opportunities in AI, especially after I/O this year, the progress we've made with multisearch, the advancements in multimodal capabilities, and the increase in voice and visual searches are all indications of how we're adding value to our core products. Similarly, at Google Marketing Live, the team highlighted numerous AI-driven products and features that effectively benefit advertisers while prioritizing privacy. In the cloud segment, most current AI opportunities are emerging from data analytics, which is where we see substantial strength.

Our shopping strategy is a crucial part of this. Regarding trends, you are correct that omnichannel strategies are vital as retailers enhance their digital presence to boost both online and offline sales, and we are actively supporting them in this effort. Over the past few quarters, I have discussed how we are achieving this. In the second quarter, similar to the first, we witnessed a year-over-year increase in the adoption of local inventory ads, which are mobile-first and location-based, assisting businesses of all sizes in showcasing their products and stock, whether in-store or available for curbside pickup. Furthermore, we are transitioning from smart shopping campaigns to Performance Max, which advertisers have found beneficial for increasing reach and performance. Our main focus continues to be on creating tools and features that facilitate connections between both online and offline businesses and their customers across our platforms.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results reflect the effect of foreign exchange. The growth in our advertising revenues was also impacted by lapping last year's elevated growth levels and the challenging macro climate. We are sharpening our focus on a clear set of product and business priorities. The product announcements we have made in just the past month alone have shown that very clearly, including significant improvements to Search powered by AI, new ways to monetize YouTube Shorts, which will support the creator ecosystem, the strong series of hardware launches and a new partnership and product announcements at Cloud Next. These will all drive value for users, partners and our business. We have also started our work to drive efficiency by realigning resources to invest in our biggest growth opportunities. Over the past quarter, we have made several shifts away from lower priority efforts to fuel higher growth priorities. Our Q4 headcount additions will be significantly lower than Q3. And as we plan for 2023, we'll continue to make important trade-offs where needed and are focused on moderating operating expense growth. Throughout Google's history, periods of dedicated focus have enabled us to emerge strongly and unleash new areas of computing innovation. For example, over a decade ago, focusing the company's efforts on mobile helped us to build and grow our business for the shift to mobile computing. We are at a similar point now with AI, another transformational technology. Our investments in AI and deep computer science mean that we can deliver a wide range of breakthroughs across our products and services to help people, businesses and communities. Turning to the quarter. First, our core information products. At our Search On event, we shared how we are using AI advances to deliver a more natural and intuitive search experience. These advancements will soon help to surface things you might find helpful before you even finish typing. We are also making visual search more natural than ever before. People now use Google Lens to answer more than 8 billion questions every month using just a photo or an image. Now we are supercharging our visual search capabilities to help people find what they are looking for at businesses nearby. Philipp will also talk in more detail about our work to make it easier to shop on Google, a key focus. Google Lens also has an amazing translation feature. It can now blend translated text seamlessly into the background of images, like menus or street signs in just 100 milliseconds, shorter than a blink of an eye. Through advanced language models, AI is unlocking new experiences that support more natural and conversational ways to interact with computing. LaMDA is one of our most promising models for this. It's now available to demo in our AI test kitchen, which offers a way for people to experience and give feedback on emerging AI technology. DeepMind also debuted its most helpful and safest language model yet. Sparrow can talk to users, answer questions and provide evidence-based answers using Google Search. Moving to YouTube, another big priority. We remain focused on long-term growth for our community of viewers, creators and advertisers. To that end, we announced some exciting changes at our Made on YouTube event last month. First, improving the monetization of Shorts. This is a big deal for creators and for our business. We'll introduce revenue sharing on Shorts early next year. This update makes YouTube the only platform where creators can monetize their content across short, long and live formats at scale. Shorts continues to show great user momentum, and we continue to invest in our mobile video tools for creators. We are seeing mobile-first creators investing more in the platform, creating content that helps the broader community grow. TV is a big area for us as well. Nielsen reported that YouTube was the leader in streaming TV viewership in the U.S. in September for the first time. Turning next to hardware. Hardware is an important area of investment for us. We are investing deeply from the silicon to the OS to powerful software experiences because it's a big opportunity to move computing forward and build deeper relationships with people who love using Google products. It also really helps to guide the Android ecosystem beyond just building the underlying platform. Earlier this month, we introduced the Pixel 7, the Pixel 7 Pro and the very first Pixel Watch. We've also previewed more detail about the Pixel Tablet, which is coming in 2023. Pixel combines our foundational technologies, AI, Android and our Google Tensor G2 processor to bring state-of-the-art AI directly to the device. The Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro offer industry-leading photography features that can unblur or sharpen photos and shoot cinema-quality videos. We recently had our highest selling week ever for Pixel, and I'm really proud of the positive reviews so far. Along with great devices, we introduced our latest release of Android. Android 13 offers new personalization features, improved privacy controls and a more seamless experience with connected devices. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q3 revenue of $6.9 billion with Google Cloud Platform's revenue growth rate above the aggregate. I've long shared that cloud is a key priority for the company. The long-term trends that are driving cloud adoption continue to play an even stronger role during uncertain macroeconomic times. Google Cloud helps customers solve today's business challenges, improve productivity, reduce costs and unlock new growth engines. At Cloud Next, we unveiled more than 100 new products and announced new and expanding relationships with Toyota, Prudential plc, Coinbase and AppLovin. The shift to hybrid work continues with organizations evolving to support an increasingly distributed workforce. I'm proud to share that Google Workspace is now used by more than 8 million businesses and organizations worldwide. That includes Korean Air as well as the U.S. Army, which is transitioning 250,000 personnel to our secure communication and collaboration platform. In the past year, we have announced nearly 300 new capabilities to support hybrid work. Empowering a distributed workforce brings an increased need for cybersecurity to keep workers' data and critical business systems safe and secure. It's top of mind for nearly every CEO I speak with, and customers, including the City of Los Angeles, Roche and Banorte put their trust in Google Cloud's industry-leading products, our new Chronicle Security Operation Suite, Unify Security Analytics, Automation Response and Threat Intelligence. This has helped Vertiv analyze 22x more security data while cutting investigation time in half. In September, we closed our acquisition of Mandiant and are proud to welcome more than 2,600 colleagues to Google. With Mandiant, we add industry-leading threat intelligence and incident response capabilities to help customers stay protected at every stage of the security life cycle. Customers partner with Google Cloud because we offer a single platform that can analyze data across any cloud. Our leadership here is winning customers across industries, including the state of Hawaii and the Australia Securities Exchange. Our capabilities help solve difficult business challenges like supply chain and logistics while also creating new growth opportunities. And as companies globally are looking to drive efficiencies, Google Cloud's open infrastructure creates a valuable pathway to reduce IT costs and modernize. In addition, with our new Media CDN product for large media streaming workloads, we are helping Major League Baseball and Paramount+ deliver flawless experiences to their customers. And with Google Cloud Edge, Rite Aid is more efficiently helping patients in their pharmacies. Across all of these areas, I'm proud of the trust and enthusiasm our customers are placing in Google Cloud. Briefly on our Other Bets, Waymo announced that Los Angeles will be its third ride-hailing city, joining Phoenix and San Francisco. Waymo will begin by mapping several neighborhoods in LA as it prepares to serve people there. Wing just surpassed 300,000 commercial deliveries. It's servicing new areas in Australia and announced its first drone delivery trials in Ireland. To close, times like this are clarifying. As we head into 2023, we are going to focus on our most important priorities as a company. To support our growth, we'll continue to invest responsibly for the long term in a way that is responsive to the current economic environment. I want to thank our employees around the world for their contributions over the last quarter. We help people, our partners and society when we focus on what we do best and execute on that really well. Over to you, Philipp.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. It's great to be joining you all today. Google Services revenues of $61 billion were up 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by a sizable foreign exchange headwind. Search and other revenues grew 4% year-over-year to $40 billion, led by travel and retail, while both YouTube Ads and Network had modest year-over-year revenue declines. Other revenues were up 2% year-over-year with growth in YouTube non-advertising and hardware revenues offset by a decrease in Play revenues. Play revenues were lower due to a number of factors, including a decline in user engagement and gaming from the elevated levels seen earlier in the pandemic. Among other factors, this shift in user behavior also created downward pressure on our advertising revenues, with lower revenues from ad promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play Ads in Search and Other. I'll highlight a couple of other trends that affected our ads business in Q3, and Ruth will provide more detail. On the second quarter earnings call, we noted a pullback in spend by some advertisers on YouTube and Network, and these pullbacks in spend increased in the third quarter. In Search and Other, the largest factor in the deceleration in Q3 was lapping the outsized performance in 2021. In the third quarter, we did see a pullback in spend by some advertisers in certain areas and search ads. For example, in financial services, we saw a pullback in the insurance, loan, mortgage and crypto subcategories. There's no question we're operating in an uncertain environment, and that businesses big and small continue to get tested in new and different ways, depending on where they are in the world. When it comes to how we're helping, our focus remains unchanged. The same AI driving breakthroughs in everything from protein folding, flood forecasting and language understanding is also fueling innovation across our Ads product. Via insights, automation and easier-to-use advertising tools and formats, we're helping businesses stay agile, build resilience, anticipate the future and show up for customers in more connected, visual and consistent ways. We're helping them understand demand, deal with inventory challenges, increase loyalty and much more. In challenging times like these, advertisers are carefully evaluating the effectiveness of their budgets. Search tends to do relatively well in such an environment, given its strong measurability and focus on delivering ROI. It's also well suited to quickly adjust to changes in consumer behavior. And when Search is coupled with our automation products across bidding, creatives, targeting or Performance Max, it can drive performance even further. Let's talk retail, an important vertical for us. No matter where shoppers are buying, whether it's in store, online or both, we have the solutions to help them deliver results wherever their customers are. Take online fashion retailer REVOLVE, who used its global influencer network along with our category insights and automated tools to acquire new customers at lower costs. As festivals and events returned to summer, REVOLVE used lower funnel solutions across search and shopping to engage with consumers in high-demand apparel categories, helping it cross $1 billion in trailing 12-month net sales for the first time. And then there's Magazine Luiza, a large Brazilian retailer, who embraced omnichannel by measuring and bidding directly to store sales. Coupled with in-store pickup and notations via PMAX, Magazine Luiza drove a 38% ROAS over 30 days and has since expanded the strategy to all eligible products, including 8 million-plus new offers. And whether shoppers know exactly what they're looking for or are just seeking inspiration, we're innovating to make it easier and more engaging for people to shop online across our services. From finding the best deals across all types of merchants, including 200 million-plus available daily deals in Q3 to new ways to search. Now when you type shop followed by whatever item you're looking for, you'll unlock a visual content stream of ideas that feel just like window shopping but online. And then there's YouTube. Not only can users now buy more products and videos, but shopping as entertainment experiences are bringing the magic of our creators to the shopping experience. Like in September, when Kylie and Kris Jenner hosted an exclusive shopping stream event to celebrate the debut of a new Kris collection for Kylie Cosmetics. And at Adweek last week, not only did we announce that product feeds are coming to Discovery, but that creators will soon be able to take products from brands across their videos, Shorts and live streams. This means viewers can shop products seamlessly while they watch their favorite content, while merchants can drive incremental reach and engagement for free listing offers when tagged by creators that viewers love and trust. I already touched on YouTube's performance in the quarter. Let's deep dive into what we're focused on. First, we're helping advertisers understand how they can drive effectiveness with every campaign they run on YouTube. Full funnel is a key way to do this. Buying YouTube across consideration, awareness and action allows marketers to meet customers at different stages in their purchasing journey, which we know are increasingly complex while delivering towards a key business goal. Creative and Media work together across the funnel to create new demand and convert current demand. Castlery, a single full furniture retailer activated a full funnel approach as part of its U.S. expansion. It used brand and action formats, identified its most relevant audiences and built a robust measurement framework to boost sales and awareness, including a 65% increase in U.S. brand searches. Castlery is using the same strategy for the upcoming holiday season. Two other areas where we're continuing to invest, Connected TV and Shorts. First on CTV. Eyeballs keep moving away from traditional TV. On average, global viewers are watching 700 million-plus hours of YouTube content on TV daily. And according to Nielsen, during the 2021-2022 U.S. broadcast seasons, YouTube reached more viewers during primetime on CTV than any linear TV network. Brands continue to take notice. Like Instacart, who tapped into CTV to maximize its TV screen strategy for its The World is Your Cart brand campaign featuring Lizzo. It drove breakout searches for its product and above-average brand lift across awareness, consideration and purchase intent. And it also engaged a significant increase in audience on top of TV with 66% lower CPMs. And then there's Shorts. 1.5 billion users every month, 30 billion daily views. Engagement is strong. We've always said that we focus on building great user and creator experiences first and then follow that with monetization over time. As of September, ads on Shorts have officially launched via video action, app and Performance Max campaigns. As Sundar mentioned, we also extended the YouTube Partner Program and announced our revenue sharing model for Shorts creators, the first of its kind for short-form content. It's early but we're encouraged by the progress we've made this year in Shorts monetization and support for sustaining the creator ecosystem. I'll close with something I've said before and I think it's worth reiterating. Our success is only possible when our customers and partners succeed. Whether it's helping individual YouTube creators or Play developers make a living and build thriving businesses or bringing the best across Google to our partners, our focus on driving growth for our partners and key ecosystems remains steadfast. I'm proud that over the past 3 years, we've paid creators, artists and media companies over $50 billion. In terms of how we're helping our partners innovate, I'll share two highlights. First, a transformative partnership with Transion, the #1 OEM in Africa and Pakistan, will help to close the digital divide by doubling annual activations by 2025 and build helpful products for the next billion users. And then in commerce with FEMSA Digital in Mexico, we're bringing together solutions across Ads, Cloud, Maps, Waze and beyond to bolster its data and analytics capabilities so it can better reach and retain its beverage and retail customers. On behalf of many, a massive thank you to our customers and partners for their collaboration, trust and feedback and another massive thank you to our sales, partnerships, product, engineering and support teams. The hard work, dedication and ingenuity of Googlers, especially during more challenging times, is truly second to none. On that note, over to you, Ruth.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the third quarter reflect healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. Our reported results clearly reflect the effect of foreign exchange. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.1 billion, up 6% or up 11% in constant currency. Our total cost of revenues was $31.2 billion, up 13%, primarily driven by other cost of revenues, which was $19.3 billion, up 20%. The biggest factor here was costs associated with data centers and other operations, followed by hardware costs. Operating expenses were $20.8 billion, up 26%, reflecting the following: first, the increases in R&D and G&A expenses, which were driven primarily by headcount growth; and second, the growth in sales and marketing expenses, which was driven primarily by increased spending on ads and promotions, followed by headcount growth. Operating income was $17.1 billion, down 19% versus last year and our operating margin was 25%. Other income and expense was a loss of $902 million. Net income was $13.9 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16.1 billion in the quarter and $63 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $116 billion in cash and marketable securities. Let me now turn to our segment financial results. As a reminder, we provide fixed foreign exchange revenues only at the consolidated level and by geographic region. All segment revenues are reported on a GAAP basis. Starting with our Google Services segment. Total Google Services revenues were $61.4 billion, up 2%. Across our advertising revenues, the year-over-year deceleration in growth rates versus the third quarter of last year was largely driven by lapping very strong performance, most notably in Search and other revenues. Additionally, the year-on-year deceleration on YouTube and Network reflects a pullback in spend by some advertisers as we first noted last quarter. In terms of the revenue lines, Google Search and other advertising revenues of $39.5 billion in the quarter were up 4%. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.1 billion were down 2%. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 2%. Other revenues were $6.9 billion, up 2%, reflecting several factors: first, subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV continued to drive ongoing strong growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues; second, we delivered solid growth in hardware revenues, primarily from sales of the Pixel 6A. Finally, the growth in these two areas was offset by a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a slowdown in buyer spend due to a number of factors, including lower engagement levels in gaming compared with earlier stages of the pandemic. In terms of costs within Google Services, TAC was $11.8 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $19.8 billion, down 17% and the operating margin was 32%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $6.9 billion for the second quarter, up 38%. GCP's revenue growth was again greater than Cloud's, reflecting significant growth in both infrastructure and platform services. Strong revenue growth in Google Workspace was driven by growth in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $699 million. As to our Other Bets for the third quarter, revenues were $209 million and the operating loss was $1.6 billion. Let me close with some comments on our outlook. Our results in the third quarter reflect an increased headwind from foreign exchange, given the ongoing strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus last year. Excluding the revenue benefit from hedging, there was a 6-point headwind year-on-year or 5 points with the hedge benefit compared with a slight tailwind in the third quarter of 2021. Looking to the fourth quarter, based on strengthening of the U.S. dollar quarter-to-date, we expect an even larger headwind from foreign exchange. In addition, as we have previously said, the impact of foreign exchange is greater on operating income than it is on revenues, given that our expense base is weighted more toward the U.S. with most of our R&D efforts located here. Turning to our segment results. Within the Google Services segment, Search and other revenues had healthy fundamental growth in the third quarter, which was affected by the impact of currency movements. As I already noted, the largest driver of the deceleration in year-on-year growth of Search compared with 3Q '21 was lapping the outsized growth in 2021. The sequential deceleration in the year-on-year growth of Search in the third quarter versus the second quarter was also driven by lapping with an additional headwind from pullback in advertiser spend in some areas. In YouTube and Network, the sequential deceleration of year-on-year growth in the third quarter versus the second quarter primarily reflects further pullbacks in advertiser spend. In the fourth quarter, the very strong revenue performance last year will continue to create tough comps that will weigh on the year-on-year growth rates of advertising revenues. Within other revenues, we expect an ongoing headwind from the slowdown in buyer spend on Google Play due to a number of factors, including lower levels of user engagement in gaming that impacted results in the second and third quarters. As Philipp mentioned, among other factors, this shift in user behavior was also a headwind to advertising revenues, with lower revenues from app promo spend on YouTube, Network and Play ads in Search and other. Turning to Google Cloud. Our results reflect momentum across GCP and Workspace. Customers globally are adopting our products and services to digitally transform their businesses. We are excited about the opportunity, given that businesses and governments are still in the early days of public cloud adoption and we continue to invest accordingly. We remain focused on the longer-term path to profitability. In terms of profitability, we have an effort underway to ensure we redeploy investments against our most compelling opportunities. As we noted on our second quarter call, our actions to slow the pace of hiring will become more apparent in 2023. With respect to Alphabet headcount, we added 12,765 people in the third quarter, including more than 2,600 of those joining Google Cloud as part of our acquisition of Mandiant. As in prior quarters, the majority of hires were for technical roles. In the fourth quarter, we expect headcount additions will slow to less than half the number added in Q3. Within this slower headcount growth, next year, we will continue hiring for critical roles, particularly focused on top engineering and technical talent. Turning to CapEx, we continue to make significant investments in technical infrastructure with servers as the largest component. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.",

Would love to get your philosophy on that. And then Philipp, a lot of comments in there about YouTube and the potential for growth going forward.

It gives us a chance to make sure we are, with clarity, identifying what are the most important areas and making sure we are directing our incremental investments towards those and as well as where we can realign.

However, I believe YouTube is well-positioned to capitalize on the streaming boom. In direct response, we see significant potential to enhance YouTube's shoppability and actionability through various features like video action campaigns, product feeds, app campaigns, and live commerce. Advertisers are increasingly using YouTube to translate intent into action and maximize performance effectively. Product feeds will soon be available for Discovery ads and have recently expanded to Shorts, where we are already observing positive results. On average, video action campaigns with product feeds have experienced over a 70% increase in conversions on Shorts compared to those without. On the brand side, viewership is shifting away from linear TV, and we are assisting brands in moving past traditional methods to efficiently meet their reach and awareness objectives. Connected TV also plays a crucial role in this strategy. YouTube is truly the optimal platform for advertisers to connect with new consumers across a variety of formats and screens, from Shorts to long-form content, podcasts, music, and CTV.",

Can you give us some examples of internal KPIs or quantifiable analysis you're running just to ensure you're generating ROI for investors from all your hiring? Just sort of run through these analyses? That's the first one. Then the second one, Philipp, just on Shorts, are you seeing Shorts lead to incremental time spent from those users?

And as I alluded to earlier, the initial progress on Shorts monetization has been encouraging. And we're focused on closing the monetization gap between Shorts and long-form content on YouTube over time. And more specifically, consumers are increasingly consuming short-form video, and we're seeing this across multiple platforms, including YouTube.

It looks like younger consumers are spending more time on TikTok searching for product reviews, recommendations, advice. I'm interested in learning if you've seen any changes in your search behavior by demographics in Google. And then do you think search has become more visual and less text-based going forward in order to maintain more relevance for its younger users? So that's one. And then Ruth, can you kind of just dig in a bit on the OpEx growth in Google Services. You called out other cost of revenues being up 20%. It looks like as a percentage of revenues, it's nearly an all-time high. Can you talk a bit about how much of that cost base is fixed versus variable? And anything on outlook on what's driving kind of the spike this quarter and maybe what you expect going forward there on the cost of revenues?",

The main factor driving the year-on-year increase in other cost of revenues remains data centers and related operations. In Q3, the second largest contributor was hardware, while CAC shifted from its usual second position to third. The change in ranking between hardware and CAC can be attributed to two main factors. First, the year-on-year decline in YouTube Ads revenues has dampened CAC growth. Second, the increase in Pixel Phone sales, particularly due to the Pixel 6A launch, influenced this shift. Overall, in relation to profitability in Google Services, we are examining the pace of investments and how changes in the mix and ongoing revenue growth opportunities affect operating income growth. As Sundar mentioned initially, some of the margin improvement last year was linked to timing issues that saw a strong revenue growth alongside a lag in investments. Our focus now is on managing for sustainable long-term results moving forward.",

So we're continuing to focus on both, the driver here, revenue, as well as the investments that we're making. And I want to make sure, to Sundar's comments about sharpening our focus, that we are economizing, utilizing resources as effectively as possible. So it is both the efforts we're taking around expense management and building for durable performance as well as the efforts we're taking, which are in the investment line but drive top line performance. I would say we also contextualize it and I tried to do that in response to Michael's questions. And we said this last year, we've noted that some of the margin upside last year was due to timing issues. And we had a very strong growth in revenues, surge in revenues and a lag in investments that we said was a timing difference, and you are seeing some of that here. But to the main point, we're looking at both what we can do to continue to support long-term revenue growth, but while doing so, being mindful of the pace of investment.

It's important to highlight that Search experienced solid growth in Q3 when excluding the effects of foreign exchange. The slowdown in Search from the second to the third quarter was mainly due to the comparison with previous performance, and I want to ensure that\u2019s understood. Additionally, there has been some reduction in advertiser spending in specific areas, which I mentioned earlier.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. It's clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic, the macroeconomic climate has become more challenging. We continue to have an extraordinary business and provide immensely valuable services for people and our partners. For example, during the World Cup final on December 18, Google Search saw its highest query per second volume of all time. And beyond our advertising business, we have strong momentum in Cloud, YouTube subscriptions, and hardware. However, our revenues this quarter were impacted by pullbacks in advertiser spend and the impact of foreign exchange. I'll focus on two major things today in a bit more detail, and then I'll give a shorter-than-usual quarterly snapshot from across our business. First, how we unlock the incredible opportunities AI enables for consumers, our partners, and for our business; and second, how we focus our investments and make necessary decisions as a company to get there. First, the AI opportunity ahead. AI is the most profound technology we are working on today. Our talented researchers, infrastructure, and technology make us extremely well positioned as AI reaches an inflection point. More than six years ago, I first spoke about Google being an AI-first company. Since then, we have been a leader in developing AI. In fact, our Transformer research project and our field-defining paper in 2017, as well as our path-breaking work in diffusion models, are now the basis of many of the generative AI applications you're starting to see today. Translating these kinds of technical leaps into products that help billions of people is what our company has always strived to achieve. Everyone working on the various projects underway is excited. We'll pursue this work boldly but with a deep sense of responsibility, with our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity at the core of all our work. We have been preparing for this moment since early last year, and you're going to see a lot from us in the coming few months across three big areas of opportunity. First, large models; we published extensively about LaMDA and PaLM, the industry's largest, most sophisticated model plus extensive work at DeepMind. In the coming weeks and months, we'll make these language models available, starting with LaMDA so that people can engage directly with them. This will help us continue to get feedback, test, and safely improve them. These models are particularly amazing for composing, constructing, and summarizing. They will become even more useful for people as they provide up-to-date, more factual information. And in Search, language models like BERT and MUM have improved searches for four years now, enabling significant ranking improvements and multimodal search like Google Lens. Very soon, people will be able to interact directly with our newest, most powerful language models as a companion to Search in experimental and innovative ways. Stay tuned. Second, we'll provide new tools and APIs for developers, creators, and partners. This will empower them to innovate and build their own applications and discover new possibilities with AI on top of our language, multimodal, and other AI models. Third, our AI is a powerful enabler for businesses and organizations of all sizes, and we have much more to come here. There's a few flavors of this. Google Cloud is making our technological leadership in AI available to customers via our Cloud AI platform, including infrastructure and tools for developers and data scientists like Vertex AI. We also offer specific AI solutions for sectors like manufacturing, life sciences, and retail and will continue to roll out more. Workspace users benefit from AI-powered features like Smart Canvas for collaboration and Smart Compose for creation. And we are working to bring large language models to Gmail and Docs. We'll also make available other helpful generative capabilities, from coding to design and more. And for our advertising partners, Philipp will discuss in detail how AI is powering dramatic campaign improvements and value-adding features for them. Overall, I see this as an important journey to reengineer the company's cost base in a durable way. There are several dimensions already underway, including prioritization of our product investments across Google and Other Bets. It also includes a careful focus on our hiring needs, reflecting these priorities, as well as efficiencies in our technical infrastructure and productivity improvements from our AI tools. Let me give a few quick updates from across the business this quarter. Just this week, we started bringing revenue sharing to YouTube Shorts, which is now averaging over 50 billion daily views, up from the 30 billion I announced on the Q1 2022 call. This will reward creators and help improve the Shorts experience for everyone. Our subscription business continues to grow, with YouTube Music and Premium surpassing 80 million subscribers, including trialers. Together with YouTube Primetime channel subscriptions and YouTube TV, we have good momentum here. YouTube's NFL Sunday Ticket will accelerate that by helping to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences, and create new opportunities for creators. Turning to hardware. Many outlets and reviewers named Pixel 7 Pro the phone of the year. Features like Magic Eraser and Photo Unblur are incredible and help differentiate Pixel from others. 2022's Pixel 6A, 7, and 7 Pro are the best-selling generation of phones we have ever launched, and we gained share in every market we operate in this year. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued momentum with Q4 revenue growing 32%. Our differentiated products and focused go-to-market strategy continue to drive customer momentum, beginning with real-time data analytics and AI. Customers are increasingly choosing BigQuery because we unify data lakes, data warehouses, and advanced AI/ML into one system and now analyze over 110 terabytes of data per second. Customers like Kroger can analyze data in multiple clouds without moving data in most cases, and MSCI processes unstructured and structured data at scale. Our reliability advantages and open edge cloud powered the mission-critical 5G network of Telefonica Germany. As I mentioned, our suite of AI/ML solutions across verticals are a key differentiator. We helped Wells Fargo automate the customer service experience for mobile users and helped improve the quality of patient care. In 2022, Mandiant, which we are now integrating, helped over 1,800 customers prepare for or recover from the most critical cybersecurity incidents. To close, we are all standing on the cusp of an era of amazing opportunities. We are going to be bold, responsible, and focused as we move into it. A healthy disregard for the impossible has been core to our company culture from the very beginning. When I look around Google today, I see that same spirit and energy driving our efforts. I'm excited for what's next. Over to you, Philipp.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar. Hello, everyone. It's good to be with you all. I'll start today with our Google Services performance in the fourth quarter and then dive deeper into our priority areas. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were down 2% year-on-year, negatively affected by sizable foreign exchange headwind. In Google advertising, Search and Other revenues were down 2% year-over-year, and YouTube Ads and Network had high single-digit revenue declines. Google Other revenues were up 8% year-over-year, with strong growth in YouTube, non-advertising and hardware revenues, offset by a decrease in Play revenues. I'll highlight two other factors that affected our Ads business in Q4. In Search and Other, revenues grew moderately year-over-year, excluding the impact of FX, reflecting an increase in retail and travel, offset partially by a decline in finance. At the same time, we saw further pullback in spend by some advertisers in Search in Q4 versus Q3. In YouTube and Network, the year-over-year revenue declines were due to a broadening of pullbacks in advertiser spend in the fourth quarter. I'll now zoom out to share more broadly where we're investing and see clear opportunities for long-term growth. First, Google AI. It's important to recognize that our advertising business has obviously benefited over the past decade from the transition to mobile. More recently, we had outsized growth in advertising revenues during the pandemic, with 2022 advertising revenues $90 billion higher than in 2019. Going forward, we are focused on growing revenues on top of this higher base through AI-driven innovation. Sundar highlighted the incredible opportunities underway with AI and the transformative impact it will have on businesses. Already, breakthroughs in everything from natural language understanding to generative AI are fueling our ability to deliver results that drive meaningful performance for advertisers and are useful to users. Take Smart Bidding, which uses AI to predict future ad conversions and their value, helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand. In 2022, AI advances boosted bidding performance, allowing us to move advertiser outcomes down the funnel to drive better ROI and use budgets more efficiently. Google AI also underlies our creative products like tech suggestions in Google ads and creative optimization and responsive search ads. We're excited to start testing our automatically created assets beta, which uses AI to generate headlines and descriptions for search created seamlessly once advertisers opt in. But we're not stopping here, and these examples aren't exhaustive. AI has been foundational to our ads business for the last decade, and we'll continue to bring cutting-edge advances to our products to help businesses and users. Number two, retail. Our foundation for delivering value over the long term includes three pillars. First, we are on a multiyear mission to make Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users. This means constantly improving our consumer experiences, starting with a more visual, immersive, browsable search. Second, we're empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ad experiences. In 2022, we saw an uptick in merchants, particularly SMBs, and product inventory coming onto Google. Adding more value for merchants remains a top priority. Third, to drive retail performance further, we focus on great ads products, from automation and insights to bidding tools and omnichannel solutions to AI-powered campaigns like PMax. We're helping retailers hit their goals and connect with customers no matter where or when they shop. Two quick insights on PMax, which we upgraded the majority of advertisers to from Smart Shopping Campaigns last year. First, advertisers on average see a 12% uplift from SSC to PMax. Second, it was a success story during the holidays and Cyber 5. Its ability to scale and adapt to changing traffic over a volatile peak retail season drove strong results for many retailers, particularly mid-market advertisers. Moving on to YouTube. Despite ongoing revenue headwinds in Q4, we're confident in YouTube's long-term trajectory. Here's how we think about our strategy. It all starts with a creator ecosystem. Creators are the lifeblood of YouTube. In 2022, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, long-form, short-form, audio, podcast, music, live streams. What sets YouTube apart is we give creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to earn money than any other platform. More creators mean more content, more viewers, which leads to more opportunities for advertisers. The creator ecosystem and our multi-format strategy will continue to drive YouTube's long-term growth. We're focused on ramping Shorts, accelerating engagement on large screens, investing in our subscription offerings, and a long-term effort to make YouTube more shoppable. First, Shorts. Viewership is growing rapidly, as Sundar said, with 50 billion-plus daily views. We're also still pleased with our continuing progress in early monetization. On the creator side, it's been impressive to see the innovative ways creators are using Shorts to introduce their content and extend existing channels. We're focused on providing creators with the best content creation and monetization tools. And ultimately, our goal is to make YouTube the best place for Shorts and creators. On that note, a big thank you to our partners and customers for their ongoing collaboration and trust, and to Googlers for their energy, focus, and dedication to helping our users, customers, and partners succeed, especially through these tougher times. Ruth, over to you.",

I will briefly cover the main points of our fourth quarter results and then turn to our outlook to give you more context for Sundar's comments on how we're focused on investing for growth as well as on reengineering our cost base for long-term success. For the fourth quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76 billion, up 1% or up 7% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. Our total cost of revenues was $35.3 billion, up 7%. Operating expenses were $22.5 billion, up 10%, reflecting an increase in R&D expenses. Operating income was $18.2 billion, down 17% versus last year, and our operating margin was 24%. Net income was $13.6 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $16 billion in the fourth quarter and $60 billion in 2022. We ended the year with $114 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to our segment results, starting with Google Services. Revenues were $67.8 billion, down 2%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were down 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $8.8 billion, up 8%, reflecting several factors: first, significant subscriber growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV; second, strong growth in hardware revenues, primarily from the Pixel family. Offsetting growth in these two areas was a year-on-year decline in Play revenues, reflecting a particularly large foreign exchange headwind in APAC. Google Services operating income was $21.1 billion, down 19%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $7.3 billion for the quarter, up 32%. Revenue growth in GCP was again greater than Google Cloud, reflecting strength in both infrastructure and platform services. Google Cloud had an operating loss of $480 million. Turning to our outlook for the business, in 2022, our year-on-year revenue growth was affected by several challenges: tough comps from the recovery in 2021, foreign exchange headwinds grew throughout the year, and a more challenging economic climate continues to impact many of our customers. We remain very optimistic about the longer-term prospects for mobile apps and gaming. In hardware, we continue to make sizable investments particularly to support innovation across our Pixel family while working to drive greater focus and cost efficiencies across the portfolio.

It is more compute-intensive but also opens up many more services and products for our users, for creators, and for advertisers. That being said, we're very focused on further optimizing the cost of compute, and that's across all elements: data center, servers, and our supply chain. So we're continuing to invest with a keen lens on the return on that capital. Regarding overall efficiency opportunities, we have a very keen focus on the three areas that I noted, and one of the key elements of it is using AI and automation to improve productivity and efficiency of our technical infrastructure. These work streams that we have in flight take longer to implement, execute, and continue to provide added upside as we go through time, which is why I indicated you would see more of an impact in 2024 than in 2023.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our business performance in the first quarter, with Search performing well and momentum in Cloud. We introduced important product updates anchored in deep computer science and AI. Our North Star is providing the most helpful answers for our users, and we see huge opportunities ahead, continuing our long track record of innovation. On Cloud, we continue to be on a long and exciting journey to build that business. Cloud delivered profitability this quarter, and we remain focused on long-term value creation here. Today, I'll give an update on the 2 themes I spoke about last quarter: one, our advancements in AI and how they are driving opportunities in Search and beyond; and two, our efforts to sharpen our focus as a company. Then I'll talk about our momentum in Cloud and close with our progress at YouTube. First, the incredible AI opportunity for consumers, our partners, and for our business. I've compared it to the successful transition we made from desktop to mobile computing over a decade ago. Our investments and breakthroughs in AI over the last decade have positioned us well. In our last call, I outlined 3 areas of opportunity: continuing to develop state-of-the-art large language models and make significant improvements across our products to be more helpful to our users; empowering developers, creators, and partners with our tools; and enabling organizations of all sizes to utilize and benefit from our AI advances. We have made good progress across all 3 areas. In March, we introduced our experimental conversational AI service called Bard. We have since added our PaLM model to make it even more powerful. And Bard can now help people with programming and software development tasks, including code generation. Lots more to come. For developers, we have released our PaLM API alongside our new MakerSuite tool. It provides a simple way to access our large language models and begin building new generative AI applications quickly. A number of organizations are using our generative AI large language models across Google Cloud Platform, Google Workspace, and our cybersecurity offerings. For years, we've been focused on making Search even more helpful. From Google Lens to multi-search, to visual exploration in Search, immersive view in Maps, Google Translate, to all the language models powering Search today; we have used AI to open up access to knowledge in powerful ways. We'll continue to incorporate generative AI advances to make Search better in a thoughtful and deliberate way. We'll be guided by data and years of experience about what people want and our high standards for quality. And we'll test and iterate as we go because we know that billions of people trust Google to provide the right information. As it evolves, we'll unlock entirely new experiences in Search and beyond just as camera, voice, and translation technologies have all opened entirely new categories of queries and exploration. AI has also been foundational to our ads business for over a decade. Products like Performance Max use the full power of Google's AI to help advertisers find untapped and incremental conversion opportunities. Philipp will talk more about this in a moment. And as we continue to bring AI to our products, our AI principles and the highest standards of information integrity remain at the core of all our work. As one example, our Perspective API helps to identify and reduce the amount of toxic text that language models train on, with significant benefits for information quality. This is designed to help ensure the safety of generative AI applications before they are released to the public. We are proud to have world-class research teams who have been advancing the breakthroughs underpinning this new era of AI. Last week, I announced that we are bringing together the Brain Team in Google Research and DeepMind into one unit. Combining all this talent into one focused team, backed by the pooled computational resources of Google, will help accelerate our progress and develop the most capable AI systems safely and responsibly. On to my second theme, the company's sharpened focus. I spoke last quarter about our commitment to invest responsibly and with discipline and to find areas where we can operate more cost-effectively and with greater velocity. We have significant multiyear efforts underway to create savings, such as improving machine utilization and finding more scalable and efficient ways to train and serve machine learning models. We are making our data centers more efficient, redistributing workloads, and equipment where servers aren't being fully used. This is important work as we continue to significantly invest in infrastructure to drive our many AI opportunities. Improving external procurement is another area where data suggests significant savings, and this work is underway. And we are taking concrete steps to manage our real estate portfolio to ensure it meets our current and future needs. We'll continue to use data to determine additional areas for durable savings. Next, Google Cloud. I'm pleased with the ongoing momentum in Cloud. Our disciplined expansion of our product road map and go-to-market organization has helped to build one of the largest enterprise software companies in the world. We have consistently grown top line revenues and improved annual operating margins, and we continue to do so this quarter. Our growth has come from our deep relationships with large enterprises, a strong partner ecosystem, and our product leadership. Over the past 3 years, GCP's annual deal volume has grown nearly 500%, with large deals over $250 million growing more than 300%. Nearly 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers, and many leading start-ups and millions of small and medium enterprises use Google Cloud. We have also built a strong partner ecosystem. Over the last 4 years, the number of Google Cloud Partner certified practitioners around the world has increased more than 15x. The largest global system integrators have built 13 dedicated practices with Google Cloud compared to 0 when we started. And today, more than 100,000 companies are part of our Google Cloud Partner Advantage program. Our growth is also driven by our product leadership. We are bringing our generative AI advances to our cloud customers across our cloud portfolio. Our PaLM generative AI models and Vertex AI platform are helping Behavox to identify insider threats, Oxbotica to test its autonomous vehicles, and Lightricks to quickly develop text-to-image features. In Workspace, our new generative AI features are making content creation and collaboration even easier for customers like Standard Industries and Lyft. This builds on our popular AI Bard Workspace tools, Smart Canvas, and Translation Hub used by more than 9 million paying customers. Our product leadership also extends to data analytics, which provides customers the ability to consolidate their data and understand it better using AI. New advances in our data cloud enable Ulta Beauty to scale new digital and omnichannel experiences while focusing on customer loyalty; Shopify to bring better search results and personalization using AI; and Mercedes-Benz to bring new products to market more quickly. We have introduced generative AI to identify and prioritize cyber threats, automate security workflows and response, and help scale cybersecurity teams. Our cloud cybersecurity products helped protect over 30,000 companies, including innovative brands like Broadcom and Europe's Telepass. We are successfully integrating Mandiant with our products, including Mandiant Threat Intelligence and Breach Analytics. Our open approach to AI development, coupled with our industry-leading TPUs and best-in-class GPUs from NVIDIA, enables innovative companies to tackle any AI workload with speed and flexibility. AI21 Labs, Replit, Midjourney, and many others build and train foundation models and generative AI platforms. We are the only cloud provider to announce availability of NVIDIA's new L4 Tensor Core GPU with the launch of our G2 VMs, which are purpose-built for large inference AI workloads, such as generative AI. Turning next to YouTube. Let me start by thanking Susan Wojcicki for her terrific leadership of YouTube for 9 years. She recently transitioned into an advisory role with Alphabet this quarter, with Neal Mohan, a long-time leader at Google and YouTube, becoming the new head of YouTube. Here are a few highlights from the quarter. YouTube Shorts continues to see strong momentum with Creators. Last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. Those posting weekly on Shorts saw the majority of new channel subscribers coming from their Shorts post. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time, and we are seeing growth and momentum internationally. On our subscription business, we rolled out several new updates to YouTube Premium. Premium subscribers can now queue videos on phones and tablets, stream continuously while switching between devices, and auto-download recommended videos for offline viewing. And we have great momentum around YouTube TV and YouTube Primetime channels. We announced pricing for the NFL Sunday Ticket offering, which will help to drive subscriptions, bring new viewers to YouTube's paid and ad-supported experiences, and create new opportunities for Creators. To close across the company, we are excited about helping people, businesses, and society reach their full potential with AI. We'll share updates at Google I/O about how we are using AI across our products, including our Pixel devices and share some exciting new developments for Android. Thanks to our employees around the world who continue to work hard to advance our mission. After nearly 25 years, the work to organize the world's information and make it accessible and useful is as urgent as ever, and I look forward to the work ahead.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hey, everyone. It's great to be here today. I'll kick off with Google Services' performance in the first quarter, then provide color into our key opportunity areas and then turn it over to Ruth for more on our financial performance. Google Services revenue of $62 billion was up 1% year-on-year, including the effect of a modest foreign exchange headwind. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, reflecting an increase in the travel and retail verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance as well as in media and entertainment. In YouTube Ads, we saw signs of stabilization and performance, while in network, there was an incremental pullback in advertiser spend. Google Other revenues were up 9% year-over-year led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Now let's double-click into the 3 areas I laid out last quarter where we see clear opportunities for long-term growth in advertising: number one, Google AI; number two, retail, which cuts across all of our ads products and services; and number three, YouTube. First, Google AI. I've said before, AI has long been an important driver of our business. Advancements are powering our ability to help businesses, big and small, respond in real-time to rapidly changing market and consumer shifts and deliver measurable ROI when it's needed most. In Q1, we continued to innovate across our products. Take Core Search, for example. In targeting, we updated search keyword relevance using the latest natural language AI from MUM models to improve the relevance and performance of shown ads when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible for an auction. In bidding, we improved our Smart Bidding models to bid more accurately based on differences in search ad formats. In other words, we bid more effectively depending on how a user wants to engage with an ad. In Creatives, we opened our Automatically Created Assets beta to all advertisers in English. ACA generates text assets alongside your responsive search ads and uses AI to help reduce the amount of manual work to keep creatives fresh and relevant to users' query, context, and to the advertisers' business. To then unlock Core Search further and maximize conversions across all of Google, we're actively helping more advertisers pair together with Performance Max. Advertisers who use PMax are, on average, achieving over 18% more conversions at a similar CPA. This is up 5 points in just 14 months, thanks to advances in the AI underlying bidding, creatives, search query matching and new formats like YouTube Shorts. I mentioned earlier that travel was a contributor to growth. In March, we launched PMax for travel goals. Now even the smallest hoteliers can benefit from the expanded reach of hotel ads in PMax, like family-run Corissia Hotels Group, who drove a 32% increase in revenue and a 26% increase in total direct bookings within just 1 month of using PMax for travel goals. There\u2019s more to come here as we add even more AI product features. Stay tuned for more at Google Marketing Live in May. Moving on to retail where we had a solid quarter. Our focus is on 3 pillars: number one, making Google a core part of shopping journeys for consumers and a valuable place for merchants to connect with users; number two, empowering more merchants to participate in our free listings and ads experiences; and number three, driving retail performance further with great ads products. In a macro environment of doing more with less, our tools and solutions are proving that we can deliver value for retailers online and omnichannel and drive high-value customers even in challenging times. Caraway, a direct-to-consumer maker of cookware, used Target ROAS to uncap budgets and PMax to optimize and deploy spend across Google inventory for its Q4 Black Friday campaign. PMax drove a 46% increase in revenue and a 31% jump in ROAS, leading to Caraway's best business day in history and robust reinvestment in its AI-first strategy for Q1. For omni-focused retailers, we recently rolled out store sales reporting and bidding in Performance Max for store goals. This is helping retailers go beyond just optimizing online conversions to also optimize to their stores, reaching and bidding for high-value customers more likely to spend in stores. Danish department store, Magasin, recently used our store sales solution to boost its omnichannel ROAS 128% versus online-only campaigns. Thanks to dynamic in-store values from its first-party data, including its high-value customers, Magasin can now measure the full impact of its online investments on e-commerce and physical store revenue.",

          "title": "CFO",
          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. Our financial results for the first quarter reflect continued healthy fundamental growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. As I go through the discussion today, I will reference some changes to our reporting and disclosures that are covered more fully in the 8-K we filed last week. I will conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $69.8 billion, up 3% or up 6% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth on a constant currency basis. In terms of expenses and profitability, year-on-year comparisons are impacted by 3 factors: first, the $2.6 billion in charges we took in the first quarter related to workforce and office space reductions. We provided a table in our earnings release that shows the impact of those charges on the cost of revenues and operating expenses. Second, the adjustment we made to the estimated useful lives of servers and certain network equipment at the beginning of 2023. As you can see in our earnings release, the effect for the first quarter was a reduction in depreciation expense of $988 million. Third, the shift in timing of our annual employee stock-based compensation awards from January to March delays the step-up in SBC from Q1 to Q2. This shift in timing does not affect the total amount of SBC over the full year 2023. Total cost of revenues was $30.6 billion, up 3%, driven by other cost of revenues of $18.9 billion, which was up 7%, the biggest factor of which was compensation costs associated with data centers and other operations followed by content acquisition costs. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 19%, with a significant impact from the charges related to workforce and office space reductions. Operating income was $17.4 billion, down 13%, and our operating margin was 25%. Net income was $15.1 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $17.2 billion in the first quarter and $62 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $115 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to our segment results. These were affected by 2 additional changes outlined in our 8-K filing. First, reflecting the increasing collaboration between DeepMind and Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets, as of Q1, DeepMind is reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. And second, beginning in the first quarter, we updated our cost allocation methodologies to provide our business leaders with increased transparency for decision-making. In our filing, we provided a recast of prior period results for the segment for these 2 changes. The highlights of the year-on-year performance of our segments that I will review reflect these recast results. Starting with Google Services, revenues were $62 billion, up 1%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $40.4 billion in the quarter were up 2%. YouTube advertising revenues of $6.7 billion were down 3%. Network advertising revenues of $7.5 billion were down 8%. Other revenues were $7.4 billion, up 9%, reflecting primarily ongoing significant subscriber growth in YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $11.7 billion, down 2%, primarily reflecting a mix shift between Search and Network. Google Services operating income was $21.7 billion, down 1%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $7.5 billion for the quarter, up 28%. Growth in GCP remained strong across geographies, industries, and products. Google Workspace's strong results were driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $191 million, and the operating margin was 2.6%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $288 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. In terms of the operating environment, our results in the first quarter reflected ongoing headwinds due to a challenging economic environment, and the outlook remains uncertain. Foreign exchange headwinds have moderated, and we expect less of a foreign exchange headwind in the second quarter based on current spot rates. With respect to Google Services, within advertising, Q1 results reflect the resilience of Search with its unique ability to surface demand and deliver measurable ROI. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, the revenue growth of Search was similar to last quarter. In YouTube, we saw signs of stabilization in ad spend on a sequential basis. We continue to prioritize growth in Shorts engagement where we are encouraged by progress in monetization. As to other revenues, in YouTube subscriptions, we are pleased with the significant ongoing subscriber growth in both YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV. In Play, revenues were down year-on-year, primarily due to the continued impact of foreign exchange in APAC, although results have improved as we lapped the impact from our introduction of fee reductions last year. Turning to Google Cloud. Our investments in product innovation, our go-to-market organization and our partner ecosystem delivered strong results as customers across industries and geographies increasingly rely on Google Cloud to digitally transform their businesses. That being said, in Q1, we continued to see slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP costs, reflecting the macro backdrop which remains uncertain. In terms of operating performance, we remain focused on driving long-term profitable growth in Cloud while continuing to invest given the substantial opportunity. Moving to Other Bets. In the first quarter, we similarly worked to refine strategies and prioritize efforts across the portfolio, including reductions to headcount. I will now walk you through an update on our efforts to reengineer our cost base, slowing the pace of operating expense growth while creating capacity for key investment areas, particularly in support of AI across the company.",

In Search, we've been utilizing AI for some time now, which has greatly improved the quality of our search results over the years through the use of large language models. We now have the opportunity to implement these models more seamlessly. As mentioned earlier, we are committed to doing this thoughtfully, with our primary focus on benefiting users. We will continue to iterate and innovate as we always have. One of the areas I'm particularly enthusiastic about is that we've learned from experience that users return to Search. They engage with content they\u2019ve already explored, and we have the chance to utilize LLMs to improve those interactions. This presents a significant opportunity. For YouTube, we aim to enhance the experience for both creators and viewers regarding how videos are consumed, so you can expect to see changes there. In Workspace, we've already begun implementing changes, and I believe this area will see the most advancement since productivity is a key area where generative AI can make an impact. Moreover, in Cloud, this is a pivotal moment for us; nearly all organizations are considering how to leverage AI for transformation. We are engaging with both start-ups and larger companies on this front. I see this as a significant turning point as well. Ruth?",

That being said, we already have AI in a lot of what we do, for example, in the way we operate and run the finance organization. It's helpful in a lot of the analytics that we use. And one of the exciting things for us is the opportunity then to share that with Cloud customers. And Sundar just noted what we're doing within Google Workspace. We obviously all live on Google Workspace. And so that's another example of how we benefit internally from the productivity from AI, but it's also something that's available for users and enterprise customers more broadly.

Initially, we will roll this out gradually to test, refine, and innovate. Overall, I believe it can address a wide range of queries, and I am enthusiastic about its potential to assist users, particularly in areas where answers may be less straightforward and require creativity. These present opportunities for us. Additionally, in our current query categories, we will also explore how AI can enhance user guidance. It's still early in the process, but there's significant innovation on the horizon. Regarding costs, we have always considered the cost of compute, and we have amassed considerable experience over the years in this area. Our habitual focus is on driving efficiencies in hardware, software, and models throughout our operations. This is not a new challenge for us. In fact, we embrace advancements in technology, as we have developed leading capabilities to lower costs progressively and implement them at scale globally. We will take all of this into account as we pursue innovation, and I am confident in our approach.",

Closing the gap between Shorts and long form is a top priority for us as is continuing to build a greater creator and user experience. Ads on Shorts are now available via video action app, Discovery, and Performance Max campaigns and via product feeds. Shorts also are shoppable. Again, we're the only destination where Creators can produce all forms of content across multiple formats and screens with multiple ways to make a living. And as Sundar said, last year, the number of channels that uploaded to Shorts daily grew over 80%. And then in February, we brought revenue sharing to Shorts via our YouTube Partner program. Our sustainable revenue sharing model at scale remains pretty unique in the industry, and we continue to see strong creator adoption.

And we do that in a way that makes sense and provide value to users. The fundamental drivers here are people are looking for relevant information. And in commercial categories, they find ads to be highly relevant and valuable. And so that's what drives this virtuous cycle. And I don't think the underpinnings over the fact that users want relevant commercial information; they want choice in what they look at. Even in areas where we are summarizing and answering, et cetera, users want choice. We care about sending traffic. Advertisers want to reach users. And so all those dynamics, I think, which have long served us well, remain. And as I said, we'll be iterating and testing as we go.

And there was also, as we noted in our earnings release, a benefit from the shift in timing of stock-based compensation from the first quarter to the second quarter, so a little bit of complexity there. But at the core of your question, we remain extremely focused on these various work streams that we've talked about. It starts with the pace of hiring. It goes to the various work streams that both Sundar and I referenced around using AI and automation to improve productivity, all that we're doing with suppliers and vendors to be as efficient as possible, all that we're doing around optimizing how and where we work. You've seen some of those announcements this quarter beyond the workforce reduction, things that we're doing in, for example, office services, and we're executing against each of these various work streams. So our view is that there's more to do. And as we try to be clear, we're in execution mode.

In Search, revenues grew modestly year-over-year, again, reflecting an increase in the retail and travel verticals, offset partially by a decline in finance and media and entertainment. So excluding the impact of FX performance, it was actually similar to last quarter. The ongoing performance of Search, notwithstanding the headwinds, reflects really Search's resilience with the, I'd say, ability of Search to surface demand and deliver a measurable ROI in an uncertain environment. I called out the key verticals in the quarter. There's really no additional color on other verticals. I'd say, maybe more broadly, what we saw reflects what's being reported elsewhere.

Hopefully, we heard you correctly. It was crackling. Look, I think as we've talked about repeatedly, as it relates to Other Bets, our focus is to use deep technology to drive innovation, and we're very focused on the pace of investment and financial returns. That has been a consistent focus to generate attractive returns. And I think the core operating models and the long-term operating models are going to be the most relevant as we're looking at the returns we can generate. Yes, absolutely mindful of the higher cost of capital, but I think, at its core, we're looking at what's the value creation and the return on those. And as we indicated when we went through the reduction in force, we similarly worked across the Other Bets. And some of them, as they're on a path to ongoing growth, we were moderating what is the expense trajectory there as we're looking at what's the overall return on invested capital.

We're helping them drive their business goals, meet customers wherever they choose to shop. Maybe a little more, some key trends here, retailers are increasingly focused on maintaining margins and driving ROI right now. PMax, Broad Match are key levers providing more incremental conversions, while insights on bids and budgets are really helping retailers identify opportunities for growth and efficiencies across our suite of products. I've talked at length on prior calls about omnichannel. Our local and omnichannel solutions are helping bridge the gap here between online and offline by using AI to reach nearby shoppers, promote local inventory fulfillment options, optimize in-store visits and sales, for example. And then to help really retain loyal customers and acquiring new ones, we have YouTube app deep linking, and new customer acquisition goals in PMax are helping here, making checkouts easy with tools like virtual cards. And Chrome is obviously important. So those are just some of the key points.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. We are holding our call from London today. It's an important hub for us, and I'm excited to spend time with our local teams, including Google DeepMind as well as leaders and partners from across the region. This quarter, we shared great progress at I/O, Brandcast and Google Marketing Live, and we are looking forward to Cloud Next in August. The momentum across the company drove our results this quarter. We delivered solid performance in Search and YouTube and ongoing strong growth in Cloud, where we remain focused on long-term value creation. And we continue our important work to operate more efficiently, creating durable savings to fund investments in our biggest priorities. Today, I'll talk about this momentum, including our continued leadership in AI and our excitement about the evolution of Search. At I/O, we shared how we are making AI helpful for everyone in four important ways. First, improving knowledge and learning. This is our seventh year as an AI-first company, and we intuitively know how to incorporate AI into our products. Large language models make them even more helpful models like PaLM 2, and soon, Gemini, which we are building to be multimodal. These advances provide an opportunity to reimagine many of our products, including our most important product, Search. We are in a period of incredible innovation for Search, which has continuously evolved over the years. This quarter saw our next major evolution with the launch of the Search Generative Experience, or SGE, which uses the power of generative AI to make Search even more natural and intuitive. User feedback has been very positive so far. It can better answer the queries people come to us with today, while also unlocking entirely new types of questions that Search can answer. For example, we found that generative AI can connect the dots for people as they explore a topic or project, helping them weigh multiple factors and personal preferences before making a purchase or booking a trip. We see this new experience as another jumping-off point for exploring the web, enabling users to go deeper to learn about a topic. I'm proud of the engineering excellence underlying our progress. Since the May launch, we've boosted serving efficiency, reducing the time it takes to generate AI snapshots by half. We'll deliver even faster responses over time. We are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that send valuable traffic and support a healthy open web. Ads will continue to play an important role in this new search experience. Many of these new queries are inherently commercial in nature. We have more than 20 years of experience serving ads relevant to users' commercial queries, and SGE enhances our ability to do this even better. We are testing and evolving placements and formats and giving advertisers tools to take advantage of generative AI. Second, we are helping people use AI to boost their creativity and productivity. One example is Bard, our experiment in conversational AI. Since launching in March, it continues to get better. We rolled out a number of exciting features and capabilities earlier this month. Bard is now available in most of the world and over 40 of the most widely spoken languages. We also added Google Lens capabilities so you can take an image and ask all kinds of questions, turn it into code, and more. This new feature has been really popular, and it's been great to see people sharing their experiences. Bard can now read its responses aloud, and you can adjust them for tone and style. We continue to see great interest in using Bard for coding tasks. On productivity, earlier this year, we introduced Duet AI in both Google Cloud and Workspace. It helps people collaborate with AI to code, write, and get better insights from data and more. Today, more than 750,000 Workspace users have access to the new features in preview. Third, we are making it easier for others to innovate using AI. One way is by providing Google Cloud's high-performance infrastructure optimized for a range of generative AI models. It's being used by thousands of customers and partners to transform their businesses. I'll give an update on the cloud business in just a moment. Finally, we are making sure we develop and deploy AI technology responsibly so that everyone can benefit. Last week, we signed on to joint commitments with other leading AI companies at the White House, building on the principles that have guided our work for many years. To take advantage of the AI opportunities ahead, we have been sharpening our focus as a company, investing responsibly with great discipline and finding areas where we can operate more cost effectively. We have made good progress in data center machine efficiency, which will pay dividends as we continue to invest in AI. We continue to slow our expense growth and pace of hiring and ensure our teams are aligned to our highest priorities. This quarter, we reallocated a number of teams, including aligning Waze's ad sales with our existing business organization. We are combining various engineering efforts across core infrastructure and cloud. Products like Bard and SGE are being built by small, fast-moving teams that have been reallocated to these high-priority efforts. Overall, we are actively moving people to higher priority activities within the company, and we continue to optimize our real estate footprint for current and future needs. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q2 revenue of $8 billion, up 28%, and operating profit of $395 million. Our AI-optimized infrastructure is a leading platform for training and serving generative AI models. More than 70% of generative AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers, including Cohere, Jasper, Typeface, and many more. We provide the widest choice of AI supercomputer options with Google TPUs and advanced NVIDIA GPUs and recently launched new A3 AI supercomputers powered by NVIDIA's H100. This enables customers like AppLovin to achieve nearly 2x better price performance than industry alternatives. Our new generative AI offerings are expanding our total addressable market and winning new customers. We are seeing strong demand for the more than 80 models, including third-party and popular open-source in our Vertex, Search, and Conversational AI platforms, with a number of customers growing more than 15x from April to June. Among them, Priceline is improving trip planning capabilities. Carrefour is creating full marketing campaigns in a matter of minutes. And Capgemini is building hundreds of use cases to streamline time-consuming business processes. Our new Anti-Money Laundering AI helps banks like HSBC identify financial crime risk. And our new AI-powered target and lead identification suite is being applied at Cerevel to help enable drug discovery. Our generative AI capabilities also give us an opportunity to win new customers and upsell into our installed base of 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. I mentioned Duet AI earlier. Instacart is using it to improve customer service workflows. And companies like Extend are scaling sales outreach and optimizing customer service. Customers confidently choose Workspace because of the safety and security we provide their distributed workforces. Our AI capabilities are helping us differentiate core products like cybersecurity. We have integrated AI throughout our portfolio, winning organizations like Pfizer who are using Google Cloud to transform their security operations. The Chronicle Security Operations suite with Mandiant fully integrated is helping customers stay protected at every stage of the security lifecycle. In the first half of 2023, we saw a 35% increase in incident response engagements compared to the same period last year. Finally, our AI capabilities are also expanding our partner ecosystem with hundreds of ISVs and SaaS providers such as Box, Salesforce, and Snorkel, and the world's largest consulting firms like Accenture and Deloitte. They've collectively committed to train more than 150,000 people on Google Cloud generative AI. Turning next to YouTube. Earlier this year, we shared that revenues across YouTube products were nearly $40 billion for the 12 months ending in March. I'm really pleased with how YouTube is growing audiences and driving increased engagement. YouTube Shorts are now watched by over 2 billion logged-in users every month, up from 1.5 billion just 1 year ago. The living room remained our fastest-growing screen in 2022 in terms of watch time. We are reaching more than 150 million people on connected TV screens in the U.S. and seeing growth in momentum internationally. And on Subscriptions, there is good growth. Late last year, we announced over 80 million YouTube Music and Premium subscribers. Sign-ups for NFL Sunday Ticket kicked off in April, and we look forward to hosting our first football season on YouTube this fall. Finally, hardware and Android. Pixel continues to have strong sales momentum. We introduced new Pixel devices at I/O, including Pixel Fold, Pixel Tablet, and Pixel 7a, and we've had a great response. Android 14, our latest OS, will incorporate our advances in generative AI to personalize Android phones. The Pixel and Android teams are working together to advance the latest devices. The Pixel Fold is a great example with its many hardware and software innovations. Before I close, you may have seen that we just announced some exciting news that Ruth is taking on the important new role of President and Chief Investment Officer. As our longest-serving CFO, she has helped guide the company through an amazing period of growth, a global pandemic, and the ongoing economic uncertainty that has followed. I'm excited to continue to work with Ruth, who will lead our 2024 planning and remain as CFO while we do a full search for a successor. So it's business as usual now and no change in approach for the future. I look forward to seeing the impact Ruth will have in her new role, driving our investments, engaging with our stakeholders, and creating opportunities for people and communities everywhere. To close, I'm energized by the pace of innovation and the momentum across the company. With 15 products that each serve 0.5 billion people and six that serve over 2 billion each, we have so many opportunities to deliver on our mission. Thank you to our employees around the world for their great work this quarter. Over to you, Philipp.",

In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 4% year-on-year, driven by growth in brand, followed by direct response reflecting further stabilization in advertiser spend. In Network, revenues declined 5% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 24% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions revenues. Let's now take a few minutes to cover our three key priority areas: Google AI, Retail, and YouTube, which I've laid out in prior quarters as clear opportunities for long-term advertising growth. I'll then turn it over to Ruth for more details on our financial performance. Q2 was a big quarter for Google AI and our Ads products. I/O, GML, and Brandcast were a testament to our deep commitment to building cutting-edge tools and solutions that help businesses navigate complexity in real time and deliver the results they need, all while improving the experience for users. Sundar covered some of these innovations. I'll share more. It's worth reiterating that while generative AI is now supercharging new and existing ads products with tons of potential ahead, AI has been at the core of our Ads business for years. In fact, today, nearly 80% of advertisers already use at least one AI-powered Search Ads product. Our approach to AI in ads remains grounded in understanding what drives real value for businesses right now and what's most helpful for users. Advertisers tell us they're looking for more assistive experiences to get set up with us faster. So at GML, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads powered by a large language model tuned specifically from ads data to make campaign construction easier than ever. Advertisers also tell us they want help creating high-quality ads that work in an instant. So we're rolling out a revamped asset creation flow in Performance Max that helps customers adapt and scale their most successful creative concepts in a few clicks. And there's even more with PMax. We launched new asset insights and new search term insights that improve campaign performance understanding and customer lifecycle goals that let advertisers optimize for new and existing customers while maximizing sales. We've long said it's all about reaching the right customer with the right creative at the right time. So later this year, Automatically Created Assets, which are already generating headlines and descriptions for search ads, will start using generative AI to create assets that are even more relevant to customer queries. Broad Match also got updates. AI-based keyword prioritization ensures the right keyword, bid, budget, creative, and landing page are chosen when there are multiple overlapping keywords eligible. And then to make it easier for advertisers to optimize visual storytelling and drive consideration in the mid-funnel, we're launching two new AI-powered ad solutions, Demand Gen and Video View Campaigns, and both will include Shorts inventory. Sundar talked earlier about SGE and our early experiments with new ad formats. We're in active conversations with advertisers, publishers, and partners to get their input on how to make these solutions work best for them and are excited to test and evolve this experience as we learn more. Let's pivot to retail, where we had a good quarter. Profitability remains a top theme for retailers, so solutions like PMax that drive bottom-line value continue to do well. We also continue to see success in helping businesses unlock efficient growth and deliver on their omnichannel goals. Take Ace Hardware, who tapped into AI-powered Search and omnibidding to capture increased seasonal demand leading up to Memorial Day. This drove increases across online sales, store visits, and in-store sales, resulting in 87% year-over-year growth in Omni revenue from Google Ads and led to one of the largest revenue weeks ever for Ace store owners. Q2 also brought innovation on the consumer and merchant front. We've rolled out a new generative AI-powered virtual try-on tool that brings the fitting room experience online. Shoppers can try on women's tops across a wide array of models from brands like Anthropologie, Everlane, H&M, and Loft. Rich, visual, engaging content is a win-win for both consumers and merchants. In fact, product offers with more than one image see a 76% average increase in impressions and a 32% increase in clicks. Our new Product Studio uses generative AI to help retailers create tailored, eye-catching imagery for free, and we are working towards optimizing for performance. We think this will be a game changer, especially for SMBs who can now create high-quality images to use both across Google and their own sites without spending a lot of time or money. As we continue to make Google a valuable place for merchants to grow their businesses and connect with users, Merchant Center Next is another win. We've seen 2x growth in the number of businesses using Merchant Center in the past 2 years. And we're now simplifying it by automating inventory management and giving a consolidated view of performance insights. Better tools mean better growth for merchants and better experiences for users. Moving to YouTube. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: YouTube starts with our Creators, and it's their success and our multi-format strategy that will drive YouTube's long-term growth. In prior quarters, I've laid out how we think about this: enabling our Creators to make a living on our platform with more formats and awesome tools leads to more content, which leads to quality consumption of video content, another big focus of the team. And this leads to better opportunities for monetization and for advertisers to support this incredible ecosystem. As we think about growth, we're focused on Shorts, Connected TV, and our subscription offerings, all of which grew nicely this quarter. Let me double-click into Shorts and CTV. First, Shorts. Momentum remains strong. Watch time and monetization are moving in the right direction. Last year, we introduced ads on Shorts to help drive performance in direct response campaigns via video action, performance max, and app campaigns. As of Q2, brand advertisers can start testing Shorts Ads in awareness campaigns. It's still early days, but we're excited by the results. Laneige, Amorepacific's number one premium skin care brand, was an early adopter. It leaned into video reach campaigns and new creative over a 10-day test to drive a 21% increase in unique users reached from Shorts and In-feed, all in a more efficient CPM. Second, Connected TV. Substantial engagement by viewers and ROI for advertisers is driving monetization of the living room. We are very pleased with the growth we've seen and how we're delivering the reach, results, and relevance that businesses are looking for at scale. At Brandcast, we announced two new ad offerings for streaming. First, 30-second unskippable ads are coming to YouTube Select, which is landing 70% plus of impressions on the TV screen. 30-second ads are a TV industry staple, and now YouTube is bringing our advanced audience capabilities and unparalleled reach to the format. We're also exploring new pause experiences so brands can drive awareness or action when you hit pause. Looking at YouTube holistically, according to our measurement partners Nielsen, TransUnion, and Ipsos MMA, YouTube delivers higher ROI than TV and other online video on average. Take the Hershey Company. As part of a multiyear partnership to optimize its YouTube strategy, Hershey's brands have been tapping into CTV, efficient AI-powered formats, and made-for-Platform creative, leading to YouTube becoming its number one ROI driving media partner, producing a 65% plus increase in ROI from 2018 to 2023. One last highlight that bridges the power of YouTube with our continued efforts to bring the best across Google to our partners. With Warner Brothers Discovery, we expanded our multiyear relationship across our entire Android ecosystem, including partnering on the launch of Max, a deepened, mutually beneficial relationship on Google TV, and plans to work together on new surfaces. YouTube's expanded deal for Max, inclusive of a Max NFL Sunday Ticket bundle on YouTube TV, also underscores our joint commitment to bring the highest quality content and experiences to our customers. I'll close by echoing Sundar with a huge thank you to Googlers everywhere for their incredible passion and hard work and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Ruth, over to you.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. Before I go into the results, first, Sundar, thank you very much for the opportunity. I'm very excited about the new role, and I look forward to it. So turning to the results. We're very pleased with our financial results for the second quarter, which reflect an acceleration of growth in Search and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $74.6 billion, up 7% or up 9% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. Total cost of revenues was $31.9 billion, up 6%, driven by other cost of revenues of $19.4 billion, which was up 8%. Growth here was driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube subscription offerings, followed by hardware costs associated with Pixel family launches in the second quarter. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we discussed last quarter. Operating expenses were $20.9 billion, up 4%. Operating income was $21.8 billion, up 12%, and our operating margin was 29%. I will cover our expense and margin performance in our outlook. Other income and expense was $65 million. Net income was $18.4 billion. We delivered free cash flow of $21.8 billion in the second quarter and $71 billion for the trailing 12 months, reflecting improved operating performance as well as the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023, as noted in our earnings release. We ended the quarter with $118 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to our segment results. Prior period results have been recast for two changes that we made as of the first quarter. First, DeepMind is now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. Second, we updated our cost allocation methodologies. In the second quarter, we then combined the Brain team from Google Research with DeepMind to form Google DeepMind. Costs associated with the Brain team, which were previously included in Google Services, are now reported as part of Alphabet's unallocated corporate costs. We have not recast prior period results to reflect this additional change. Within Google Services, revenues were $66.3 billion, up 5%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $42.6 billion in the quarter were up 5%, led by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were up 4%, driven by brand advertising, followed by direct response reflecting further stabilization in spending by advertisers. Network advertising revenues of $7.9 billion were down 5%. Other revenues were $8.1 billion, up 24%, reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues, primarily from subscription growth in YouTube Music Premium and YouTube TV, followed by growth in hardware revenues primarily driven by the launch of the Pixel 7a in the second quarter. Finally, Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter. TAC was $12.5 billion, up 3%. Google Services operating income was $23.5 billion, up 8%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8 billion for the quarter, up 28%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries, and products. That being said, we saw a continued moderation in the rate of consumption growth as consumers optimize their spend. Google Workspace strong revenue growth was driven by increases in both seats and average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $395 million and the operating margin was 5%. As to our Other Bets, for the second quarter, revenues were $285 million, and the operating loss was $813 million. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities related to certain Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising, we were pleased with the acceleration of Search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Our continued ability to generate sustained growth reflects our unparalleled engineering innovation that creates extraordinary experiences for users and capabilities for advertisers delivered with the deep expertise of our go-to-market team. And in YouTube, we saw ongoing signs of stabilization in advertiser spending. We are prioritizing product focus on increasing quality consumption of video content with both Shorts and in the living room, which is translating into improved monetization. Second, within other revenues. In our YouTube subscription products, the sustained, strong growth in revenues reflects significant subscriber growth. You may have seen that last week, we increased subscription prices for YouTube Music and Premium, which underscores the value of the products. Strong year-on-year growth in hardware revenues was due, in large part, to a timing change given the Pixel 7a was launched in the second quarter, whereas the Pixel 6a launch occurred in the third quarter last year. Looking ahead, the launch timing change will be a headwind to hardware revenue growth in the third quarter. Play returned to positive growth in the second quarter, driven primarily by a solid increase in the number of buyers. Turning to Google Cloud. We are particularly excited about the customer interest in our AI-optimized infrastructure, our large language models, our AI platform services, and our new generative AI offerings such as Duet AI for Google Workspace, although we are still clearly in the early days. At the same time, we continue to experience headwinds in the second quarter for moderation in consumption growth as customers optimize their spend. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we remain very focused on durably reengineering our cost base. Most evident to date are the actions we have taken to reduce the pace of headcount growth, including the workforce reductions we announced in the first quarter and a slower pace of organic hiring, in part given our focus on reallocating talent from within to fuel our growth priorities. A quick comment on the sequential improvement in operating margins in the second quarter. There are two factors to note. First, the benefit from an acceleration in search advertising revenue growth in the second quarter. Second, the vast majority of the charges related to our workforce reduction and optimization of our global office space were taken in Q1. Finally, as it relates to CapEx, in Q2, the largest component was for servers, which included a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The sequential step-up in the second quarter was lower than anticipated for two reasons. First, with respect to office facilities, we continue to moderate the pace of fit-outs and ground-up construction to reflect the slower expected pace of headcount growth. Second, there were delays in certain data center construction projects. We expect elevated levels of investment in our technical infrastructure increasing through the back half of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. The primary driver is to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet, including investments in GPUs and proprietary TPUs as well as data center capacity. With all that said, we remain committed to durably reengineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term sustainable financial value. Thank you.

Sundar, I'd be curious to learn about some of your early learnings and surprises around consumer behavior on how people are using Bard versus Search. And what new behaviors or consumer utility are you most excited about as you think about what Gemini could provide for people over the course of the next year or so? And then the second one for Ruth. Ruth, congrats on the new position. One question just about the durable expense comment. I think last quarter, you talked about the idea that expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that still the right way to think about it? And just to confirm, does that include the impact of depreciation in those comments?",

I think we are definitely now able to serve, I would say, deeper and broader information use cases, which is very exciting. I wouldn't say surprised. So for example, people really using it for coding, something we understood, but it's definitely on the new side. There's a lot of excitement around the integration of Google Lens into Bard. We have known how big Google Lens can be. We see that in the visual searches we get and how much it has grown over the last two years, and so we've been doing this for a while. But definitely, that in Bard has been super well received. So this gives me a sense that as Gemini is being built from the ground up to be multimodal, I think that's an area that's going to excite users. When I go back many years ago when we did universal search, we were able to abstract different content types and put them in a seamless way, and users tend to receive it well.

I would say that our investments in AI reflect the extensive computer science work and talent we've carefully brought into the company. From the beginning, we've always considered the infrastructure in our data centers. We strive to innovate wherever we can to gain an edge, whether in AI or silicon development. Our primary focus remains on our users and customers, ensuring that we support all necessary innovations. For instance, in the cloud sector, we've adopted an open architecture approach and acknowledge our customers' preferences for multi-cloud solutions when it benefits them. Similarly, in AI, we plan to not only utilize our own models but also provide third-party options, including open-source models, which we believe are essential in this ecosystem. Google is a significant contributor to projects like Hugging Face, as well as others like Android and Kubernetes. We will continue to embrace this collaborative spirit and stay at the forefront of technology, which we believe will be advantageous for us in the long run.",

And then I think Sundar summarized it well. We see technology can make such a difference in the lives of so many and the lives of economies. And to be able to focus on the impact on economic growth and the opportunity for people, for organizations, and for countries I think is a privilege.

I would say we are performing better than I anticipated at this stage. The feedback has been very positive, and we've improved our efficiency dramatically since the product launch. Latency has also seen significant improvements. We're maintaining high standards, and I believe we're excelling on all internal metrics. I'm very satisfied with our progress.

It is an exciting moment overall in Cloud because there is definitely a lot of interest from customers on AI, and they definitely are engaging in many more conversations with us. So I would say, without commenting on the short term, but when I think about it long term, I view the AI opportunity as expanding our total addressable market and allowing us to win new customers. Scale of investments that we can directly bring to Cloud now. As I said earlier, we have over 80 models across Vertex, Enterprise, Search, and Conversational AI, and we are taking all of them, translating it into deep industry solutions. So I'm excited about it. Second, it gives us an opportunity to upsell and cross-sell into our installed base. So for example, if you think about Duet AI in Google Workspace now, it's a collection of all our generative AI-powered collaboration features. We can bring it and make it available to more than 9 million paying Google Workspace customers. Similarly, Duet AI in Google Cloud, again, allows us to go back to our installed base and engage in deeper conversations. And finally, I think AI helps us differentiate our core products. For example, if you take a look at cybersecurity, we are deeply incorporating AI to drive profound changes there. So overall, I'm excited, and I view this as a long-term opportunity. And all the investments we are doing in AI across Alphabet, including the work we are doing in Google DeepMind and Google Research on Gemini and so on, are directly applicable to Cloud as well.

If you step back, you're seeing real signs now of weakness in linear TV, ad agencies, small and digital companies were all slowing, and the macro backdrop is definitely cloudy, yet you guys have accelerated your growth this quarter. What factors are you looking at do you see that would identify why you are growing while others are really struggling and slowing down? And then Sundar, I think you spent over $100 billion on R&D over the past five years, and yet there's a narrative that it's so competitive and so expensive to compete going forward. Can you talk a bit about how you're visiting that R&D spend? Any near-term cadence updates you can give us for growth? And any factors that could change the growth going forward for research and development spending for you guys?",

That's the foundation on which the company is built. And taking that and applying it and building new products and services and generating value is the virtuous cycle. And so nothing changes in that fundamental thesis. We are definitely both, as Ruth mentioned, on AI investments, we are going to be committed to making sure we invest to realize the opportunity. But all the work we are doing on efficiency and optimization applies to the AI side as well. And so we're bringing all that lens there so that we do this responsibly.

As mentioned at GML, we have been consistently developing new AI features. I briefly discussed our progress regarding generative AI in my prepared remarks.

And if you think about where generative AI would have the most impact, could you peel it apart what's your guess now over the next couple of years where it's going to have the most impact on the creative, on the audience creation, on the campaign optimization? Where do you think the most impact will come from generative AI just for all of your advertising customers?",

For example, we launched a new conversational experience in Google Ads, the asset creation flow. In PMax, I mentioned the automatically created assets, the Product Studio and so on. When I talk to customers, they're very excited about AI and understandably have some questions. One of the top questions is, for example, what's the next best step I should take? And this is a key reason why we launched our Google Ads AI Essentials, which was a big announcement at GML. It's a checklist of simple steps customers can take right now to unlock the power of AI, and it has to do with the foundation of data and measurement. It has to do with taking action with our AI-powered products and really is a mindset shift to set up organizations for AI success. So those are just some examples.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. I'm pleased with our business results this quarter, which demonstrates strong growth in Search and YouTube and momentum in Cloud. Google turned 25 in September, which offered an opportunity to reflect on our progress over the last quarter century and to look ahead to the opportunities enabled by AI we are so excited and confident about. Our product momentum continued this quarter, as you saw with Cloud Next, Made on YouTube, and Made by Google. It's all part of our focus on making AI more helpful for everyone, and we are making good progress across the four areas that we shared last quarter. First, improving knowledge and learning. This includes our work with the Search Generative Experience, which is our experiment to bring Generative AI capabilities into Search. We have learned a lot from people trying it, and we have added new capabilities, like incorporating videos and images into responses and generating imagery. We've also made it easier to understand and debug generated code. Direct user feedback has been positive with strong growth and adoption. In August, we opened up availability to India and Japan with more countries and languages to come. As we add features and expand into new markets, we are engaging with the broader ecosystem and will continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users, send valuable traffic to publishers, and support a healthy open Internet. With Generative AI applied to Search, we can serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. We are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, creating new opportunities for content to be discovered. Of course, ads will continue to play an important role in this new Search experience. People are finding ads helpful here as they provide useful options to take action and connect with businesses. We'll experiment with new formats native to SGE that use Generative AI to create relevant high-quality ads customized to every step of the Search journey. The second area we are focused on is boosting creativity and productivity. Bard is particularly helpful here. It's a direct interface to a conversational LLM, and we think of it as an early experiment and complementary experience to Google Search. Bard can now integrate with Google apps and services, showing relevant information from Workspace, Maps, YouTube, and Google Flights and Hotels. We've also improved the Google it feature. It provides other sources to help people evaluate Bard's responses and explore information across the web. Earlier this month, we announced Assistant with Bard, a personal assistant powered by Generative AI. It combines Bard's generative and reasoning capabilities with Assistant's personalized help. You can interact with it through text, voice, or images, and in the coming months, you'll be able to opt-in on Android and iOS mobile devices. Our collaborative tools in Workspace and YouTube are also part of how we boost creativity and productivity, and they are seeing great initial traction. Third, we are enabling developers, businesses, and other organizations to build their own transformative products and services. For example, thousands of customers and partners are already using Google Cloud to capture the potential of AI and we'll share more there in a minute. And fourth, we are building and deploying AI responsibly, so that everyone can benefit. One area we are focused on is making sure people can more easily identify when they are encountering AI-generated content online. Using new technology powered by Google DeepMind SynthID, images generated by Vertex AI can be watermarked in a way that is invisible to the human eye without reducing the image quality. Underlying all this work is the foundational research done by our teams at Google DeepMind and Google Research. We are excited to roll out more of what they've been working on soon. As we expand access to our new AI services, we continue to make meaningful investments in support of our AI efforts. We remain committed to durably re-engineering our cost base in order to help create capacity for these investments in support of long-term sustainable financial value. Across Alphabet, teams are looking at ways to operate as effectively as possible, focused on their biggest priorities. Turning next to YouTube, which saw solid momentum in both its ads and subscription businesses in Q3. NFL Sunday Ticket is now live and receiving excellent reviews. Fans love our multi-view feature, which can live stream up to four games on a single screen. We\u2019ve heard positive feedback from our partners at the NFL about the new features and live stream reliability. This is a clear example of our ability to execute big partnerships with excellence and at scale. I'm really pleased with the growth and engagement on YouTube Shorts. We continue to work on closing the monetization gap here. Shorts now average over 70 billion daily views and are watched by over 2 billion signed-in users every month. At Made on YouTube in September, we announced new tools that make it easier to create engaging content. Dreamscreen is an experimental feature that allows creators to add AI-generated video or image backgrounds to shorts. And YouTube Create is a new mobile app with a suite of production tools for editing shorts, longer videos, or both. Next, Google Cloud. We see continued growth with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%. Today, more than 60% of the world's 1,000 largest companies are Google Cloud customers. At Cloud Next, we showcased amazing innovations across our entire portfolio of infrastructure, data and AI, workspace collaboration, and cybersecurity solutions. We offer advanced AI-optimized infrastructure to train and serve models at scale. And today, more than half of all funded Generative AI startups are Google Cloud customers. This includes AI21 Labs, Contextual, Elemental Cognition, Rytr, and more. We continue to provide the widest choice of accelerator options. Our A3 VMs powered by NVIDIA's H100 GPU are generally available, and we are winning customers with Cloud TPU v5e, our most cost-efficient and versatile accelerator to date. On top of our infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform helps customers build, deploy, and scale AI-powered applications. We offer more than 100 models, including popular third-party and open-source models, as well as tools to quickly build, search, and conversation use cases. From Q2 to Q3, the number of active Generative AI projects on Vertex AI grew by 7x, including Highmark Health, which is creating more personalized member materials. Duet AI was created using Google's leading large foundation models and especially trained to help users become more productive on Google Cloud. We continue expanding its capabilities and integrating it across a wide range of cloud products and services. With Duet AI, we are helping leading brands like PayPal and Deutsche Bank boost developer productivity. And we are enabling retailers like Aritzia and Gymshark to gain new insights for better and faster business results. In fact, companies are increasingly using AI for the purpose of analyzing data. And customers are choosing Google Cloud because we are the only large cloud provider with a unified platform to analyze structured and unstructured data. In Workspace, thousands of companies and more than a million trusted testers have used Duet AI. They are writing and refining content in Gmail and Docs, creating original images from text within slides, organizing data in Sheets, and more. These innovations enable us to provide new services and grow our base of 10 million paying customers, including enterprises like Grupo Boticario, Unilever, and Warner Music. We also integrated Duet AI across our cybersecurity portfolio to differentiate in the marketplace, providing Generative AI-powered assistance in Mandiant Threat Intelligence, Chronicle Security Operations, and Security Command Center. This reduces the time security teams spend writing, running, and refining searches by seven times. We are the only leading security provider that combines frontline intelligence and expertise, a modern security operations platform, and a trusted cloud foundation, all infused with Generative AI, helping protect customers and partners like BT, Jack Henry & Associates, and CoverMyMeds. Turning to hardware. We unveiled our new products this month. We introduced our new Pixel 8, Pixel 8 Pro, and Pixel Watch 2 to very positive consumer feedback and reviews. Pixel is the fastest growing smartphone brand in our top markets and the only one that grew in units sold year-over-year. Our portfolio of Pixel products is brought to life, thanks to our combination of foundational technologies, AI, Android, and Google Tensor. Google Tensor G3 is the third generation of our tailor-built chip. It's designed to power transformative experiences by bringing the latest in Google AI research directly to our newest phones. New AI-powered editing features in Google Photos on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro remove distractions, generate the best shot from multiple images, and reduce distracting sounds in videos. Pixel and our third-party ecosystem are powered by Android. We just released Android 14 with more accessibility features. I also want to mention Chromebook Plus, a new category which provides the best of Chrome on great hardware with built-in Google Apps and powerful AI capabilities. We also shared that Chromebooks will now get regular automatic updates for 10 years, more than any other operating system. In Other Bets, Waymo is onboarding more riders to its commercial ride-hailing service as it gradually adds over 100,000 people from its San Francisco waitlist. Austin will follow as its next ride-hail city. Wing and Walmart announced a new partnership to provide drone delivery service in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. Before handing over to Philipp, I want to thank our employees around the world who are working to create innovative products and provide great services to people and businesses who use our products.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. I'll start with our performance for the quarter and then give color into the three key priority areas for ads: Google AI, Retail, and YouTube that we've identified on past calls as opportunities for long-term growth in advertising. Google Services revenues of $68 billion were up 11% year-on-year. In Google Advertising, Search and Other, revenues grew 11% year-on-year, led by solid growth in the Retail vertical. In YouTube Ads, revenues were up 12% year-on-year, driven by growth in both brand and direct response. In Network, revenues declined 3% year-on-year. Google Other revenues were up 21% year-on-year, led by strong growth in YouTube subscription revenues. Let's start with Google AI. Recent dramatic advances in everything from foundational research models to LLM to Generative AI are improving our ability to deliver better performance and profitability for advertisers and more helpful, delightful experiences for users. We covered many innovations last quarter after GML, like our conversational experience in Google Ads, significant updates to Performance Max, and new campaign types like Demand Gen. As Sundar said, we're continuing to experiment with new ad formats on SGE. It's extremely important to us that in this new experience, advertisers still have the opportunity to reach potential customers along their Search journeys. I'll highlight more ways we're innovating with the best of Google AI as we double-click into our core business. In Retail, we had a great quarter. In a market where every dollar counts, our proven AI-powered solutions like Search and PMax are helping retailers drive reliable, strong ROI and meet customers wherever they are across the funnel. In Q3, we also started prepping retailers for what will be a long holiday season. Let me share some things. Number one, with a maximum number of days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and expectations for many micro peaks beyond Cyber-Five, we're arming businesses with insights and planning tools, including OptiScore and Performance Planner to uncover new opportunities, plan budgets and targets to stay competitive and be smarter with their inventory and pricing strategy. Number two. Consumer expectations are shifting, especially around price and convenience. We've seen 4x deals queries during the holidays versus other periods. 75% of users say they'll shop with those offering free shipping. Retailers are capitalizing on these trends with our differentiated merchant offerings like merchant promotions and fulfillment options. And we're making improvements to significantly boost the number of deals shown to shoppers in Search this holiday season. Look out for more in the coming days about new ways we'll help shoppers browse deals across the web this year. Number three. No surprise, omni-channel is the way to succeed. With our suite of omni product solutions, including local inventory ads, omnibidding, and PMax for store goals, retailers, big and small, are capturing demand and incremental store budgets while engaging with high-value customers. Innovation continues across our shopping and merchant experiences powered by Google AI. Our virtual try-on tool for apparel launched in June and has been a hit with consumers and brands. Users engage with virtual try-on images at a higher rate versus regular brand-provided images. Product Studio is another launch from GML getting positive feedback in pilot mode. It uses the best of Gen.AI to help businesses create unique and tailored imagery for free that they can then scale across their channels. We're seeing early merchant testers using it to seasonalize their content for the holidays. Let's shift to YouTube. It's worth repeating, our intense focus on creator success coupled with our multi-format strategy are at the center of how we think about YouTube's long-term growth. Shorts, connected TV, and our subscription offerings are key drivers here, and we're investing across each to solidify YouTube's position as the best place to create, the best place to watch, and the best place to deliver results. Sundar mentioned watch time and engagement momentum on shorts as well as our monetization progress. He also covered subscription growth and NFL Sunday Ticket. As for connected TV, we continue to be the number one overall streaming destination according to Nielsen. 150 million plus people are watching YouTube on CTV screens every month in the US. Whether it's music videos, NFL Sunday Ticket, free movies, shorts, a continuous stream of MrBeast, or some other creator-led content, viewers want choice and variety, and we're giving it to them all in one place. And to help creators and advertisers connect with these billions of viewers across moments, screens, and formats, we're bringing Google AI to awesome new creation tools and ad solutions. AI will do wonders for creation and storytelling. From Dreamscreen and YouTube Create, which Sundar talked about, to features that audit content in multiple languages, flip and trim existing assets, remix and clip videos, and more, we're just getting started. We're also helping brands break through at speed and scale across the funnel to drive results. Spotlight Moments launched last week. It uses AI to identify trending content around major cultural moments for brand sponsorship opportunities. There's video reach campaigns, which are expanding to in-feed and shorts and will be generally available in November. AI is helping advertisers find as many people as possible in their ideal audience for the lowest possible price. Early tests are delivering 54% more reach at 42% lower cost. And then with video view campaigns, AI is serving skippable ads across in-stream, in-feed, and shorts and helping advertisers earn the maximum number of views at the lowest possible cost. So far, they're driving 40% more views on average versus in-stream alone. Then for YouTube and other feed-based services, there's our new Demand Gen campaign, which launched in April, rolled out worldwide last week, and was designed for the needs of today's social marketers to engage people as they stream, scroll and connect. It combines video and image ads in one campaign with access to 3 billion users across YouTube and Google and the ability to optimize and measure across the funnel using Google AI. Demand Gen is already driving success for brands like Samsung and Toyota. Before I wrap, one quick highlight on our close collaboration and commitment to our most important ecosystems and partners. In July, we launched Google News Showcase in the US, our curated online news experience and licensing program with more than 150 news publications, 90% of which are local or regional. Globally, over 2,500 news publications have signed onto News Showcase, and the product is live in 23 countries today. Our commitment to open access to news and information remains strong. With that, I'll end with a thank you to our customers and partners around the world for their continued trust and collaboration, and our Googlers everywhere for their incredible hard work and dedication. Ruth, over to you.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the third quarter, driven by meaningful growth in Search and YouTube and momentum in Cloud. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the third quarter, our consolidated revenues were $76.7 billion, up 11% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.2 billion, up 7%, primarily reflecting other cost of revenues of $20.6 billion, which was up 6%. Growth here was primarily driven by content acquisition costs mainly for YouTube subscription offerings. As noted in our earnings release, the overall increase in data center and other operations costs was partially offset by a reduction in depreciation expense due to the change in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of the year. Operating expenses were $22.1 billion, up 6% reflecting the following: first, an increase in R&D expenses, driven primarily by compensation; second, an increase in G&A expenses, reflecting the impact of charges related to legal matters; and finally, sales and marketing expenses, which were relatively flat to last year. Operating income was $21.3 billion, up 25%, and our operating margin was 28%. Other income and expense was a loss of $146 million. Net income was $19.7 billion. This reflects an effective tax rate of 7% in the third quarter from an IRS change related to the use of foreign tax credits, which had an outsized impact on the third quarter rate because the change resulted in a catch-up for prior periods. We delivered free cash flow of $22.6 billion in the third quarter and $78 million for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $120 billion in cash and marketable securities. As a reminder, our cash balance and free cash flow in the second and third quarters benefited from the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter of 2023. As noted in our earnings release, on October 16, we made an estimated tax payment of $10.5 billion related to this deferral, which will be reflected in our cash balance and free cash flow in the fourth quarter. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $68 billion, up 11%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $44 billion in the quarter were up 11%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8 billion were up 12%, driven by both brand advertising and direct response. Network advertising revenues of $7.7 billion were down 3%. Other revenues were $8.3 billion, up 21%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube non-advertising revenues driven by subscriber growth in YouTube TV followed by YouTube Music Premium. TAC was $12.6 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $23.9 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $8.4 billion for the quarter, up 22%. GCP revenue growth remained strong across geographies, industries, and products, although the Q3 year-on-year growth rate reflects the impact of customer optimization efforts. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud had operating income of $266 million, and the operating margin was 3%. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $297 million and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. After a period of historic volatility, we were pleased with the year-on-year revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising in the third quarter. Second, within other revenues, in our YouTube subscription products, the substantial growth in revenues primarily reflects subscriber growth. Looking ahead, a full quarter of NFL Sunday Ticket revenues as well as associated content acquisition costs will be reflected in Q4 results compared to only a few weeks in the third quarter. Play had growth in the third quarter, driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. With respect to hardware, there is a headwind to revenues in the fourth quarter, reflecting efforts to optimize the portfolio with tighter targeting of our go-to-market investments as well as the ongoing impact from the difference in launch timing for the Pixel 6a and 7a that we mentioned last quarter. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with the ongoing customer engagement with GCP and Workspace and the potential benefit of our AI solutions including infrastructure and services such as Vertex AI and Duet. We continue to invest aggressively given the significant potential we see while remaining focused on profitable growth. In terms of expenses and profitability, we're pleased with our operating performance. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain focused on durably reengineering our cost base to create investment capacity to support our growth priorities, most important of which is with AI. We have a number of workstreams in place. First, we are maintaining a slower pace of headcount growth, reflecting product prioritization and reallocation of talent to support our most important growth opportunities. Second, we remain focused on optimizing our real estate footprint, including how and where we work to reduce our expense growth. As you can see from our earnings release, we incurred $207 million in accelerated rent and depreciation in the third quarter related to these actions. Third, we have engineering workstreams underway to improve productivity across Alphabet. Given the magnitude of investment in our technical infrastructure, we have a superb team focused on the efficiency of our operations there. We are also making progress in streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI. Finally, there are ongoing workstreams that are improving the efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization. And to be clear, across the portfolio of other bet companies, we have also been working to identify opportunities to create sharper focus and to operate more efficiently and effectively. With respect to sequential quarter-on-quarter trends, two further points. First, cost of sales in the fourth quarter will reflect both higher hardware costs given Pixel family launches as well as increased CAC for YouTube as previously noted. Second, as usual, we expect sales and marketing expenses to be more heavily weighted to the end of the year, in part to support product launches in the holiday season. Finally, our reported CapEx in Q3 was $8 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers, followed by data centers, reflecting a meaningful increase in our investments in AI compute. The growth in reported cash CapEx in Q3 is somewhat muted due to the timing of supplier payments, which can cause variability from quarter-to-quarter. We continue to invest meaningfully in the technical infrastructure needed to support the opportunities we see in AI across Alphabet and expect elevated levels of investment, increasing in the fourth quarter of 2023 and continuing to grow in 2024. In closing, we remain very excited about the opportunities ahead and committed to delivering sustainable financial value. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions.",

There's somewhat of an investor debate about sort of the incremental return on capital to Search when it comes to AI. I know it's early, but are there any examples that you're seeing with SGE or Bard on higher utility, higher conversion rates, more engagement, just something to sort of show signal around the return that could come from these investments? And the second one, Ruth, I know you've spoken a lot about durably reengineering the cost base. I think in the past, you've talked about how expenses could grow slower than revenue in 2024. Is that sort of still the high-level way to think about it or is that potentially changing a bit as investments are continuing? Thanks.",

Through it all, we are making sure the product works well, and we are generating value for our ecosystem, and that adds transitions as well. And I think I view this with AI, the opportunity to evolve Search and Assistant over the next decade ahead. And I think as we've always seen, when you continue to invest and build great experiences, you can get value on the other side. And I do think over time, there will be newer paths, just like we have done on YouTube. I think with the AI work that our subscription models is a possible path as well.

I'm very excited at the progress there and as we're working through getting the model ready. To me, more importantly, we are just really laying the foundation of what I think of as the next generation series of models we'll be launching throughout 2024. The pace of innovation is extraordinarily impressive to see. We are creating it from the ground up to be multimodal, highly efficient tool, and API integrations, and more importantly, laying the platform to enable future innovations as well. And we are developing Gemini in a way that it is going to be available at various sizes and capabilities, and we'll be using it immediately across all our products internally as well as bringing it out to both developers and cloud customers through Vertex. So I view it as a journey and each generation is going to be better than the other, and we are definitely investing and the early results are very promising. On Cloud, maybe what I would say is, overall, we had definitely started seeing customers looking to optimize spend. We leaned into it to help customers given some of the challenges they were facing. And so that was a factor. But we are definitely seeing a lot of interest in AI. There are many, many projects underway now, just on Vertex alone, the number of projects grew over 7x. And so we see signs of stabilization, and I'm optimistic about what's ahead.",

That would be the first question. And then about a year ago, Philipp and Ruth started talking about some of the brand advertising headwinds that YouTube was facing.

It offers advertisers optimal performance across all inventory through a single AI-driven campaign, showcasing AI in action within our ad products. It's providing excellent return on investment, with users typically seeing over 18% more conversions at a similar cost per action. Since its rollout about two years ago, we've expanded its features, giving advertisers more control over its operation. This includes options like account-level negative keywords and additional functionalities. We introduced new customer life cycle goals and revamped the asset creation flow, which assists businesses in adapting and scaling their most effective creatives. This is something to keep an eye on. We will also keep developing new Performance Max features based on feedback from advertisers, and we're very encouraged by the progress we've made here. Regarding your second question about customer feedback, many are focused on driving ROI and efficiency. The consumer landscape is rapidly changing and unpredictable. Our AI tools are well-received, and there is significant interest in AI and generative AI. Nearly 80% of our advertisers are using at least one AI-powered search ad product. We're getting positive feedback on our ads AI essentials, which are key in leveraging AI for sustainable ROI growth for advertisers. These include foundational tools for data and measurement, like Google Tag and Consent Mode, along with Performance Max and our various generative AI products.

We're particularly pleased about the ongoing performance in the Living Room and on Shorts. And as I said, that's both watch time growth and monetization I'd say the other thing benefiting YouTube is the retail strength we talked about with Search, retail strength in APAC in both Search and YouTube, and that really began in the second quarter, continued in the third quarter, but that was another contributor.

This is not a new challenge, and I am confident that our teams, both on the organic and advertising sides, will deliver the right experience for users, which includes advertising, and will yield positive results. We will continue to refine and make headway in this area. On your second question, overall, as we celebrate our 25th anniversary, I take pride in the strength of the work we have accomplished in building our company's infrastructure and the various stages we've experienced with new technology adoption. We have always considered the costs and have consistently driven impressive efficiency improvements. I believe the current situation is no exception.

Looking ahead, we are optimistic about achieving a solid return over the duration of the deal. We are continuing to invest in support of this initiative and are enthusiastic about the additional opportunities it presents, including collaborations with partners to provide clips and other offerings.

And part of our work we do in making Search be world-class and give users what they're looking for so that we can get it as much of that intent as possible. So I don't see that changing. With mobile, there were more ways people could get information, but we worked out to make Search work better in the mobile world. And similarly, a view with AI, there'll be many ways people get information, but it also offers us an opportunity in Search and in Assistant to take it to the next level and answer use cases, which we couldn't have done before and expand the diverse set of needs where we are sourced.

Our ads team is testing these APIs. As we shared back in April, the preliminary results of our interspace ads testing showed that a combination of what we call privacy preserving signals and AI optimization actually provides positive results for businesses preparing for a cookie-less future. We also recently announced that in Q1 of '24, we plan to deprecate third-party cookies for 1% of Chrome users, and this will support developers, obviously, in conducting their real-world experiments to assess the readiness and effectiveness of their products without third-party cookies.

          "content": "Hello, everyone. Our results reflect strong momentum and product innovation continuing into 2024. Today, I'm going to talk about four main topics. One, our investments in AI, including how it's helping Search; two, subscriptions, which reached $15 billion in annual revenue, up 5 times since 2019. Subscriptions are growing strongly powered by YouTube Premium and Music, YouTube TV and Google One. Three, Cloud, which crossed $9 billion in revenues this quarter and saw accelerated growth driven by our GenAI and product leadership; and four, our investments and focus to meet the growth opportunities ahead. First, AI and Search. As you know, we have long led the way in using AI to improve many of our products from Search to Ads to most of our consumer and enterprise products, helping billions of people already. Last year brought new excitement around GenAI, and I'm proud of how we responded responsibly with deep advances in foundation models and a number of great launches. We closed the year by launching the Gemini era, a new industry-leading series of models that will fuel the next generation of advances. Gemini is the first realization of the vision we had when we formed Google DeepMind, bringing together our two world-class research teams. It's engineered to understand and combine text, images, audio, video and code in a natively multimodal way, and it can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers. Gemini gives us a great foundation. It's already demonstrating state-of-the-art capabilities, and it's only going to get better. Gemini Ultra is coming soon. The team is already working on the next versions and bringing it to our products. That starts with Search. We are already experimenting with Gemini in Search, where it's making our Search Generative Experience, or SGE, faster for users. We have seen a 40% reduction in latency in English in the U.S. I'm happy with what we are seeing in the earliest days of SGE. It's available through Search Labs in seven languages. By applying generative AI to Search, we are able to serve a wider range of information needs and answer new types of questions, including those that benefit from multiple perspectives. People find it particularly useful for more complex questions like comparisons or longer queries. It's also helpful in areas where people are looking for deeper understanding, such as education or even gift ideas. We are improving satisfaction, including answers for more conversational and intricate queries. As I mentioned earlier, we are surfacing more links with SGE and linking to a wider range of sources on the results page, and we'll continue to prioritize approaches that add value for our users and send valuable traffic to publishers. Beyond SGE, we are continuing to use AI to make searching more accessible and intuitive. Circle to Search lets you search what you see on Android phones with a simple gesture without switching apps. It's available starting this week on Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro and the new Samsung Galaxy S24 Series. And Lens now offers generative AI overviews. You can add text to a visual search to ask questions about anything you see and get AI-powered insights in the moment. In addition to Search, we are also seeing a lot of interest in our AI-powered solutions for advertisers, including our new conversational experience that uses Gemini to accelerate the creation of Search campaigns. Then there is Bard, our conversational AI tool that complements Search. It's now powered by Gemini Pro and is much more capable at things like understanding, summarizing, reasoning, coding and planning. It's now in over 40 languages and over 230 countries around the world. Looking ahead, we'll be rolling out an even more advanced version for subscribers powered by Gemini Ultra. That's a good segue to subscriptions. As I said earlier, it's now a $15 billion business annually. YouTube is the key driver of our subscription revenues. Available in over 100 countries and regions, YouTube Music and Premium have real momentum. They're engaging passionate users and driving great returns for the music industry and creators. YouTube TV is also doing well. We've had great consumer feedback on the viewing experience. People love the navigation, multiview and unlimited DVR. NFL Sunday Ticket has found its perfect home on YouTube, and Philipp will talk about that more. Let me also talk about our subscription service, Google One. It's doing incredibly well with strong user growth. It provides expanded storage, unlocks exclusive features in Google products and allows us to build a strong relationship with our most engaged users. Google One is growing very well, and we are just about to cross 100 million subscribers. From here, we are going to bring in more AI features and look forward to more strong growth to come. Next, Google Cloud. Throughout 2023, we introduced thousands of product advances, including broad GenAI capabilities across our AI infrastructure, our Vertex AI platform and our new Duet AI agents. In Q4, our product and GenAI leadership enabled us to win and expand relationships with many leading brands, including Hugging Face, McDonald's, Motorola Mobility and Verizon. Google Cloud offers our AI Hypercomputer, a groundbreaking supercomputing architecture that combines our powerful TPUs and GPUs, AI software and multi-slice and multi-host technology to provide performance and cost advantages for training and serving models. Customers like Anthropic, Character.AI, Essential AI and Mistral AI are building and serving models on it. For developers building GenAI applications, we offer Vertex AI, a comprehensive enterprise AI platform. It helps customers like Deutsche Telekom and Moody's discover, customize, augment and deploy over 130 GenAI models, including PaLM, MedPaLM, Sec-PaLM and Gemini, as well as popular open source and partner models. Vertex AI has seen strong adoption with the API request increasing nearly 6 times from H1 to H2 last year. Using Vertex AI, Samsung recently announced its Galaxy S24 Series smartphone with Gemini and Imagen 2, our advanced text-to-image model. Shutterstock has added Imagen 2 to their AI image generator, enabling users to turn simple text prompts into unique visuals. And Victoria's Secret & Co. will look to personalize and improve the customer experience with Gemini, Vertex AI, Search and Conversations. Customers are increasingly choosing Duet AI, our packaged AI agents for Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform, to boost productivity and improve their operations. Since its launch, thousands of companies and over 1 million trusted testers have used Duet AI. It will incorporate Gemini soon. In Workspace, Duet AI is helping employees benefit from improved productivity and creativity at thousands of paying customers around the world, including Singapore Post, Uber and Woolworths. In Google Cloud Platform, Duet AI assists software developers and cybersecurity analysts. Duet AI for Developers is the only GenAI offering to support the complete development and operations life cycle, fine-tuned with the customer's own core purpose and policies. It's helping Wayfair, GE Appliances and Commerzbank write better software, faster with AI code completion, code generation and chat support. With Duet AI and Security Operations, we are helping cybersecurity teams at Fiserv, Spotify and Pfizer. Our robust growth has been driven by strong direct and indirect channels. With ISVs, we have nearly tripled the number of co-sell deals from 2022 to 2023. In our ecosystem, there are nearly 90,000 Google Cloud GenAI-enabled consultants. And Accenture has teamed up with Google Cloud to create a joint generative AI center of excellence. Next, let me turn to our focus and discipline as we pursue the opportunities ahead. Search, YouTube and Cloud are supported by our state-of-the-art compute infrastructure. This infrastructure is also key to realizing our big AI ambitions. It's a major differentiator for us. We continue to invest responsibly in our data centers and compute to support this new wave of growth in AI-powered services for us and for our customers. Through this, we are being disciplined in how we run the company. You've heard me talk about our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base and to improve our velocity and efficiency. That work continues. Teams are working to focus on key priorities and execute fast, removing layers and simplifying their organizational structures. As just one example, our devices team has brought together different teams from across Nest, Fitbit and other teams into a new functional structure. This will help us pull resources and drive progress across our Pixel portfolio. Across different teams, we have wound down some non-priority projects, which will help us invest and operate well in our growth areas. We are also improving our machine utilization, building on our years of experience in driving cost efficiencies in our computing infrastructure and operations. And through our supplier efficiency efforts and automation of certain processes, we have made major improvements in areas like procurement, achieving significant savings. That's a snapshot of the quarter. Before I close, a couple of other highlights. Pixel 8, our AI-first phone, was awarded Phone of the Year by numerous outlets. It now uses Gemini Nano with features like Magic Compose for Google Messages and more to come. In our Other Bets portfolio of companies, Waymo, which is deeply focused on safety, reached over 1 million fully autonomous ride-hailing trips. And Isomorphic Labs entered into strategic partnerships with Eli Lilly and Novartis to apply AI to treat diseases, which has great potential. 2023 was a year of profound innovation and product momentum. Thank you to our many partners. We succeed when our partners do, and we are grateful for the work we do together. From our partners across the Android ecosystem who are on display at CES to our deep relationships with retailers, small businesses and advertising partners, to the next generation of AI start-ups and developers, and many more. I also want to thank all of our employees for their hard work throughout 2023 and the start of the new year. I'm excited for what's ahead in 2024.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenues of $76 billion were up 12% year-on-year. In Google advertising, Search and other revenues grew 13% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical. We had particular strength in retail in APAC, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through the end of the year. YouTube ads revenue were up 16% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 2% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, which was previously named Google Other, year-on-year revenues increased 23% driven by strong growth in subscriptions. Now for some color on the quarter and where we see continued upside for long-term advertising growth. Over the last few calls, I have consistently highlighted how we're putting Google AI to work for our customers to deliver profitability and help them achieve their goals in a do-more-with-less environment. From a product perspective, in Q4, Performance Max remained a bright spot. We're also excited about demand gen momentum. This is our big bet to help social advertisers find and convert consumers via immersive, relevant visual creatives across YouTube, including YouTube Shorts, Gmail and Discover. In a single campaign, you get access to over 3 billion users as they stream, scroll, connect and decide what to buy. Tens of thousands of advertisers are testing and on average seeing 6% more conversions per dollar versus image-only ads and discovery campaigns. As we look ahead, we're also starting to put generative AI in the hands of more and more businesses to help them build better campaigns and even better performing ads. Automatically created assets help advertisers show more relevant search ads by creating tailored headlines and descriptions based on each ad's context. Adoption was up with strong feedback in Q4. In addition to now being available in eight languages, more advanced GenAI-powered capabilities are coming to ACA. And then last week's big news was that Gemini will power new conversational experience in Google Ads. This is open and beta to U.S. and U.K. advertisers. Early tests show advertisers are building higher-quality search campaigns with less effort, especially SMBs who are 42% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength. We can't wait to see how this continues to drive performance and level the playing field for advertisers of all sizes. As we shared last quarter, Ads will continue to play an important role in the new search experience, and we'll continue to experiment with new formats native to SGE. SGE is creating new opportunities for us to improve commercial journeys for people by showing relevant ads alongside search results. We've also found that people are finding ads either above or below the AI-powered overview helpful as they provide useful options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Looking at our strong Search performance for the fourth quarter. Retail was a highlight. We continue to see a stronger start to the season up to and including Cyber Five. In Q3, we indicated that we were seeing early trends of consumers being very price-conscious, and we saw this play out in Q4. With promotional demand at an all-time high, deal seekers using Google had access to double the deals in the U.S. versus last season as well as a better shopping experience. Launches included a one-stop-shop deals destination, new filters like Get it Fast and AI-generated gifting recommendations in SGE. These new features drove incremental query growth during key shopping moments like Cyber Five. Our proven AI-powered ad solutions were also a win for retailers looking to accelerate omni growth and capture holiday demand. Quick examples include a large U.S. big-box retailer who drove a 60%-plus increase in omni Return on Ad Spend and a 22%-plus increase in store traffic using Performance Max during Cyber Five; and a well-known global fashion brand, who drove a 15%-plus higher omnichannel conversion rate versus regular shopping traffic by showcasing its store pickup offering across top markets through pickup later on shopping ads. Moving on to YouTube. We're obviously pleased with YouTube's advertising revenue growth in Q4 and also significant growth in our subscription revenue. I'll reiterate what I have said before: YouTube's success starts with creator success. We give millions of creators more ways to create content and connect with fans and more ways to make money and build their own businesses than any other platform. More creators means more content, which leads to more viewers. And via ads and subscriptions, these viewers fund our creators and drive the eyeballs and engagement our advertisers want. To keep this momentum going, we're focused on delivering value across four pillars: creation, viewers, monetization and responsibility. First, creation, which increasingly takes place on mobile devices. We've invested in a full suite of tools, including our new YouTube Create app for Shorts, to help people make everything from 15-second Shorts to 15-minute videos to 15-hour live streams with a production studio in the palm of their hands. GenAI is supercharging these capabilities. Anyone with a phone can swap in a new backdrop, remove background extras, translate their video into dozens of languages, all without a big studio budget. We're excited about our first products in this area from Dream Screen for AI-generated backgrounds to Aloud for AI-powered dubbing. There is more to come. Number two, viewers. We continue to grow watch time across YouTube with strong growth in Shorts and connected TV. Shorts remains a top priority. We have 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, and we are averaging 70 billion in daily views. Connected TVs, or what we refer to as the living room, is where viewership is growing the fastest. We're investing to make this experience even better with interactive features tailored to TVs, plus the content people love: our creators, NFL Sunday Ticket and the range of live sports and studio content via YouTube TV and Primetime Channels. Put this all together and YouTube is the must-have app on every connected TV. Monetization is pillar #3 and realized through a combination of ad-supported and subscription offerings. Advertising generates the bulk of our revenue, and we continue to invest heavily here. We've rolled out Connected TV-first formats like 30-second non-skippable ads and pause experiences as well as an industry-first send-to-phone experience that lets people use a second screen to engage with ads. For Shorts, we've developed new formats that are less interruptive to viewers. It's early. We're learning but excited by the opportunities for ads this can unlock. Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. Our AI-powered video formats from video reach and video view campaigns to demand generation and video action continue to make advertiser dollars go further and drive results across the funnel. We're also introducing new and existing advertisers to YouTube via sports content. Over 90 upfront and scatter advertisers, including Unilever, are partnering with YouTube in our first year across NFL Sunday Ticket in-game advertising opportunities. Our subscription offerings are also growing at a healthy clip. YouTube Music and Premium performed well. Premium users are delivering more value to our partners and YouTube than even ad-supported users do. On average, each additional Premium sign-up boosts earnings for creators, music and media partners and YouTube itself. And we've made Premium even more attractive with new features, bundles and other enhancements. We're also pleased with our first season of NFL Sunday Ticket. It gave creators new opportunities to create content and feed user engagement across traditional user content and professional sports content. Feedback on the user experience, including multiview, has been great. We're excited to continue to innovate here. Responsibility is our fourth pillar, and it underlines everything we do across YouTube. We continue to focus relentlessly on this. As always, deepening our relationships with key partners to bring them the best of Google is a key priority for us, and we continue to do this across industries in Q4. We just talked about the NFL. Sundar mentioned Samsung, among others earlier. Another highlight was our expanded partnership with Porsche to enhance customers' digital experiences with a deeper in-vehicle integration of Google built-in services, including Google Maps and Play. Whether it's continued collaboration with our partners and key ecosystems, we're putting Google AI to work for more customers. I'm excited about the opportunities for continued impact in 2024. I'll wrap with a huge note of gratitude to our customers and partners. Our success is only possible because of their success and then to our Googlers for their outstanding work and focus this year. Ruth, over to you.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our full year results with 2023 Alphabet revenues of $307 billion, up 9% versus 2022, which added $25 billion to revenues for the year. We ended with a strong fourth quarter with consolidated revenues of $86.3 billion, up 13% versus last year in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. Total cost of revenues was $37.6 billion, up 6%. Other cost of revenues was $23.6 billion, up 5%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube subscription offerings. The growth rate also reflects the offsetting benefit of lapping $1.2 billion in inventory-related charges that we called out in the fourth quarter last year as well as a reduction in depreciation expense due to changes in estimated useful lives we made starting in the first quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect an additional $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and Operating Expenses based on associated head count. Operating expenses were $25 billion, up 11%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D expenses, which were driven by the real estate charges, followed by compensation. Operating income was $23.7 billion, up 30%, and our operating margin was 27%. Net income was $20.7 billion, and EPS was $1.64. We delivered free cash flow of $7.9 billion, which was affected by the timing of the $10.5 billion tax payment we made on October 16 that we called out previously related to the deferral of certain tax payments to the fourth quarter. For the full year 2023, free cash flow was $69 billion. We repurchased a total of $62 billion of our Class A and Class C shares in 2023 and ended the year with $111 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $76.3 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48 billion in the quarter were up 13%, led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $9.2 billion were up 16% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $8.3 billion were down 2%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues, which we previously referred to as other revenues, were $10.8 billion, up 23%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $14 billion, up 8%. Google Services' operating income was $26.7 billion, up 32%, and the operating margin was 35%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.2 billion for the quarter, up 26%. We're very pleased with the momentum of GCP with an increasing contribution from AI. Google Workspace also delivered strong revenue growth primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $864 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the full year 2023, revenues were $1.5 billion and the operating loss was $4.1 billion. Results in the fourth quarter benefited from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. We were pleased with the sequential revenue growth of Search and YouTube advertising throughout 2023, which reflects the extraordinary work across our teams to drive improved experiences for users and attractive ROI for advertisers. As we enter 2024 with advertising revenues of more than $100 billion higher than 2019, we remain focused on sustaining healthy growth on this larger base. Second, within subscriptions, platforms and devices, our total revenues from subscription products reached $15 billion for the full year 2023 driven primarily by substantial growth in subscribers for our YouTube subscription offerings. The substantial increase in our subscription revenues over the past few years demonstrates the ability of our teams to deliver high value-add offerings and provides a strong base on which to build, including through YouTube and newer services like Google One. Play had solid growth again in the fourth quarter driven primarily by an increase in the number of buyers. In devices, we continue to make sizable investments with increased emphasis on our Pixel family, particularly with AI-powered innovation while driving further efficiencies across the portfolio. Turning to Google Cloud. We are pleased with operating performance in the year. Full year revenues of $33 billion were up 26% versus prior year, ending with strong Q4 performance. The Cloud team is intensely focused on bringing the benefits of Gemini, our industry-leading AI technology, to enterprises and governments globally, and we are gratified with the level of engagement. The strong demand we are seeing for our vertically integrated AI portfolio is creating new opportunities for Google Cloud across every product area. In terms of profitability, the improvement in 2023 reflects sustained focus across the team with the intent to maintain healthy profitability while we continue to invest to support long-term growth. Turning to margins and expenses. As we have repeatedly stressed, we remain committed to our framework to durably reengineer our cost base as we invest to support our growth priorities. Key contributors to moderating our expense growth include: first, product and process prioritization to ensure we have the right resources behind our most important opportunities and to reallocate resources where we can; second, organizational efficiency and structure. We're focused on removing layers to simplify execution and drive velocity. Both product prioritization and the organization design efforts result in a slower pace of hiring, as you can see with our head count down year-on-year, reflecting the reductions we announced in the first quarter of 2023 and a much slower pace of hiring. We will continue to invest in top technical and engineering talent. Finally, we continue to execute the other work streams to slow expense growth, including improving efficiency in our technical infrastructure, streamlining operations across Alphabet through the use of AI, increasing efficiency of our spend with suppliers and vendors through our central procurement organization and optimizing our real estate portfolio. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $11 billion, driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The step-up in CapEx in Q4 reflects our outlook for the extraordinary applications of AI to deliver for users, advertisers, developers, cloud enterprise customers and governments globally and the long-term growth opportunities that offers. In 2024, we expect investment in CapEx will be notably larger than in 2023. With regard to Other Bets, we've been working to sharpen our investment focus while capturing the upside given compelling technology breakthroughs across the portfolio. For example, last week, Alphabet's X announced that it would be moving to spin out more projects as independent companies through external capital, giving X the opportunity to bring more focus to the breakthrough technologies it is working on to address some of the world's most pressing challenges.

AI has been integral to our advertising products for a long time, and recent advancements are enabling us to provide more value for advertisers in various areas including bidding, targeting, and creative, as well as enhancing our core experiences for advertisers and publishers. For instance, in core search ads, value-based bidding stands out on the bidding side, broad match is significant on the targeting front, and responsive search ads are making a difference in creative with automatically generated ad assets. We are pleased with the progress in these areas. I previously mentioned the importance of AI essentials in preparing everyone to fully utilize these tools. We've also seen great progress with Performance Max in Q4. Overall, we are on track with our expectations.  Regarding sales force intensity, we've made some reallocations, or portfolio adjustments. We have two main teams: the Large Customer Solutions team, which focuses on transformational growth for our largest clients, and the Global Customer Solutions team, which serves every customer from our biggest accounts to millions of smaller businesses. The GCS team is actively driving growth by providing tailored support for each client and has been our fastest-growing channel, achieving strong growth in Q4. We\u2019ve redirected resources towards the GCS side, but it's important to clarify that our restructuring isn\u2019t due to AI eliminating roles.

This quarter, we've focused on improving organizational efficiency and structure by removing layers to simplify execution and increase speed. This focus on product prioritization and organizational design has led to a slower hiring pace, as reflected in our year-on-year headcount numbers and our fourth-quarter results. We also expect a significantly lower hiring rate in the first quarter. Currently, we estimate that severance-related costs will be around $700 million in the first quarter as we continue these efforts. Nonetheless, we will keep investing in top engineering talent. This is crucial, along with the severance-related expenses, as we continue our work. Additionally, we have various initiatives aimed at enhancing efficiency in our technical infrastructure\u2014a substantial ongoing effort; streamlining operations across Alphabet using AI; collaborating with our suppliers and vendors; and optimizing our real estate portfolio.

And this actually allows advertisers to reach football fans across YouTube's pretty unique breadth of NFL content, independently of whether you're viewing live NFL games or on YouTube TV or Primetime Channels or watching NFL highlights, post-game commentary on YouTube channels. And we saw solid demand across the ad market around our YouTube Sunday Ticket offering here. We're excited about the partnership ahead or the partnerships ahead. This is our first season.

When you think about the evolution of product over the next couple of years, how do you envision more traditional search and things like the Google Assistant continuing to evolve in a world of Search Generative Experience and Bard? And what that might mean for elements of commercial and noncommercial search and how use cases might change in the years ahead? And then Ruth, I just want to make sure we understood some of the messaging from the release and the public comments around one-timers in the quarter itself. It seems as if they were not allocated to the segments but are more elements of Other Bets and Alphabet-level activities. I just want to confirm whether elements of those one-timers were captured in the P&L statement and whether there were also any elements of legal one-timers that would be called out this quarter as well.",

We continue to refine it, and it works exceptionally well for certain types of queries. We're expanding the range of queries where it performs well and significantly improves how we answer a particular category of queries for the first time. This gives us a clear direction moving forward. Many people underestimate the complexity of Search and the variety of queries we encounter daily that are new to us. The challenge is to provide a high-quality experience across all the queries we process in Search. Over time, we believe that Assistant will complement this effort. We plan to leverage generative AI, especially with our advanced models in Bard, which will enable us to act more like an agent in the future, going beyond just providing answers and following up with users more effectively. So, that's the opportunity we see ahead. There's a lot of execution required, but we have a good understanding of the way forward, and the feedback from our efforts thus far has been extremely positive.",

On the international side, it's something we are closely looking at. There's nothing specific I have to add at this moment in time on this one. On the Shorts monetization side, look, we built Shorts to respond to the huge demand from both creators and viewers for short-form video. And we're very pleased with the growth we've seen. I mentioned 2 billion-plus logged-in users every month, 70 billion in daily views. Specifically to the monetization question, Shorts monetization continues to progress nicely. In fact, actually, since we introduced revenue sharing for Shorts, the total creator earnings generated from Shorts have increased every month, and we expect this to continue.

And as you saw that greater than 70% of GenAI unicorns are using Google Cloud. And so I think it's an area where our strengths will continue to play out as we go through '24, especially when I look at innovation ahead from us on the AI front.

We can certainly leverage this more actively in the advertising space. AI continues to enhance our video ad solutions and measurement capabilities, making it an integral part of video-rich campaigns. Multi-format ads are supported, and there's generative creator music that simplifies the process for creators to create the perfect soundtrack. As I mentioned earlier, AI will open up new avenues for creativity.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. It was a great quarter led by strong performance from Search, YouTube, and Cloud. Today, I want to share how we are thinking about the business and the opportunity more broadly. Of course, that's heavily focused on AI and Search. Then I'll take you through some highlights from the quarter in Cloud, YouTube and beyond. Let's discuss our momentum and strategy. Taking a step back, it took Google more than 15 years to reach $100 billion in annual revenue. In just the last six years, we have gone from $100 billion to more than $300 billion in annual revenue. Of course, Search continues to power that as you see in our Q1 results. But in addition, we expect YouTube overall and Cloud to exit 2024 at a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion. This shows our track record of investing in and building successful new growing businesses. Now let's look at how well we are positioned for the next wave of AI innovation and the opportunity ahead. There are six points to make: one, research leadership; two, infrastructure leadership; three, innovation in Search; four, our global product footprint; five, velocity in execution; six, monetization paths. First, our foundation of research leadership. We've been an AI-first company since 2016, pioneering many of the modern breakthroughs that power AI progress for us and for the industry. Last week, we further consolidated teams that build AI models under Google DeepMind. This will help simplify development and establish a single access point for our product teams as they build generative AI applications with these models. The teams are making rapid progress, developing Gemini and other models. In February, we rolled out Gemini 1.5 Pro, which shows dramatic performance enhancements across a number of dimensions. It includes a breakthrough in long context understanding, achieving the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model yet. Combining this with Gemini's native multimodal understanding across audio, video, text, code and more, it's highly capable. We are already seeing developers and enterprise customers enthusiastically embrace Gemini 1.5 and use it for a wide range of things. Beyond Gemini, we have built other useful models, including our Gemma open models as well as image and visual models and others. Second, infrastructure leadership. We have the best infrastructure for the AI era. Building world-leading infrastructure is in our DNA, starting in our earliest days when we had to design purpose-built hardware to power Search. Our data centers are some of the most high-performing, secure, reliable, and efficient in the world. They've been purpose-built for training cutting-edge AI models and designed to achieve unprecedented improvements in efficiency. We have developed new AI models and algorithms that are more than 100x more efficient than they were 18 months ago. Our custom TPUs, now in their fifth generation, are powering the next generation of ambitious AI projects. Gemini was trained on and is served using TPUs. We are committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure. You can see that from the increases in our capital expenditures. This will fuel growth in Cloud, help us push the frontiers of AI models and enable innovation across our services, especially in Search. AI innovations in Search are the third and perhaps the most important point I want to make. We have been through technology shifts before, to the web, to mobile, and even to voice technology. Each shift expanded what people can do with Search and led to new growth. We are seeing a similar shift happening now with generative AI. For nearly a year, we've been experimenting with SGE in search labs across a wide range of queries. And now we are starting to bring AI overviews to the main Search results page. We are being measured in how we do this, focusing on areas where generative AI can improve the search experience while also prioritizing traffic to websites and merchants. We have already served billions of queries with our generative AI features. It's enabling people to access new information, ask questions in new ways and to ask more complex questions. Most notably, based on our testing, we are encouraged that we are seeing an increase in search usage among people who use the new AI overviews as well as increased user satisfaction with the results. And with Circle to Search, people can now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video and get an AI overview with Lens. Fourth, our global product footprint beyond Search. We have six products with more than 2 billion monthly users, including three billion Android devices. Fifteen products have 0.5 billion users, and we operate across 100-plus countries. This gives us a lot of opportunities to bring helpful generative AI features and multimodal capabilities to people everywhere and improve their experiences. We have brought many new AI features to Pixel, Photos, Chrome, Messages and more. We are also pleased with the progress we are seeing with Gemini and Gemini Advanced through the Gemini app on Android and the Google app on iOS. Fifth, improved velocity in execution. We've been really focused on simplifying our structures to help us move faster. In addition to bringing together our model-building teams under Google DeepMind, we recently unified our ML infrastructure and ML developer teams to enable faster decisions, smarter compute allocation, and a better customer experience. Earlier this year, we brought our Search teams together under one leader. And last week, we took another step, bringing together our platforms and devices teams. The new combined team will focus on delivering high-quality products and experiences, bolstering the Android and Chrome ecosystems, and bringing our best innovations to partners faster. We also remain focused on long-term efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. You can see the impact of this work reflected in our operating margin improvement. We continue to manage our headcount growth and align teams with our highest priority areas. This speeds up decision-making, reduces layers, and enables us to invest in the right areas. Beyond our teams, we are very focused on our cost structures, procurement and efficiency. A number of technical breakthroughs are enhancing machine speed and efficiency, including the new family of Gemini models and a new generation of TPUs. For example, since introducing SGE about a year ago, machine costs associated with SGE responses have decreased 80% from when first introduced in Labs, driven by hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs. We remain committed to all of this work. Finally, our monetization path. We have clear paths to AI monetization through Ads and Cloud as well as subscriptions. Philipp will talk more about new AI features that are helping advertisers, including bringing Gemini models into Performance Max. Our Cloud business continues to grow as we bring the best of Google AI to enterprise customers and organizations around the world. And Google One has now crossed 100 million paid subscribers, and in Q1, we introduced a new AI premium plan with Gemini Advanced. Okay, those are the six points. So now, let me turn to quarterly highlights from Cloud and YouTube in a bit more detail. In Cloud, we have announced more than 1,000 new products and features over the past eight months. At Google Cloud Next, more than 300 customers and partners spoke about their generative AI successes with Google Cloud, including global brands like Bayer, Cintas, Mercedes-Benz, Walmart and many more. Our differentiation in Cloud begins with our AI hypercomputer, which provides efficient and cost-effective infrastructure to train and serve models. Today, more than 60% of funded generative AI startups and nearly 90% of generative AI unicorns are Google Cloud customers. Customers like PayPal and Kakao Brain are choosing our infrastructure. We offer an industry-leading portfolio of NVIDIA GPUs along with our TPUs. This includes TPU v5p, which is now generally available and NVIDIA's latest generation of Blackwell GPUs. We also announced Axion, our new Google-designed and Arm-based CPU. In benchmark testing, it has performed up to 50% better than comparable x86-based systems. On top of our infrastructure, we offer more than 130 models, including our own models, open source models and third-party models. We made Gemini 1.5 Pro available to customers as well as Imagine 2.0 at Cloud Next. We shared that more than 1 million developers are now using our generative AI across tools, including AI Studio and Vertex AI. We spoke about how customers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Etsy can quickly and easily build agents and connect them to their existing systems. For example, Discover Financial has begun deploying generative AI-driven tools to its nearly 10,000 call center agents to achieve faster resolution times for customers. Customers can also now ground their generative AI with Google Search and their own data from their enterprise databases and applications. In Workspace, we announced that organizations like Uber, Pepperdine University and PennyMac are using Gemini and Google Workspace, our AI-powered agent that's built right into Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and more. We also announced Google Vids, a new application to create stories in short video format. And we introduced Gemini for Meetings and Messaging and Gemini Security for Workspace. Customers are choosing Workspace because they have deep trust in our powerful security and privacy features. Our Cloud business is now widely seen as the leader in cybersecurity. I saw this firsthand when I went to the Munich Security Conference in February. Cybersecurity analysts are using Gemini to help spot threats, summarize intelligence and take action against attacks, helping companies like American Family Insurance aggregate and analyze security data in seconds instead of days. Turning next to YouTube, which continues to grow and lead in streaming. We announced that on average, viewers are watching over 1 billion hours of YouTube content on TVs daily. AI experiments like Dream Screen will give anyone the ability to make AI-generated backgrounds for YouTube Shorts. And on subscriptions, which are increasingly important for YouTube, we announced that in Q1, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally, including trialers. YouTube TV now has more than 8 million paid subscribers. Finally, in Other Bets, Waymo's fully autonomous service continues to grow ridership in San Francisco and Phoenix with high customer satisfaction, and we started offering paid rides in Los Angeles and testing rider-only trips in Austin. Overall, it was a great quarter, and there's more to come. IO is in less than three weeks, followed by Brandcast and Google Marketing Live. I want to thank our employees around the world who are at the heart of this progress and who continue to focus on building innovative products, helpful services, and new opportunities for businesses and partners around the world. Thank you. Philipp?",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hi, everyone. Google Services revenue of $70 billion was up 14% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led again by solid growth in the retail vertical with particular strength from Asia-Pacific based retailers, which began in the second quarter of 2023. YouTube Ads revenues were up 21% year-on-year driven by growth in both direct response and brand. Network revenues declined 1% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 18%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. Let's now talk about a few highlights from the quarter from a product innovation and advertising performance perspective. First, it bears repeating that AI innovation across our Ads ecosystem is core to every aspect of our product portfolio, from targeting, bidding, creative, measurement, and across campaign types. We've talked about whole solutions like Smart Bidding use AI to predict future ad conversions and their value in helping businesses stay agile and responsive to rapid shifts in demand and how products like broad match leverage LLMs to match ads to relevant searches and help advertisers respond to what millions of people are searching for. This is foundational. As advances accelerate in our underlying AI models, our ability to help businesses find users at speed and scale and drive ROI just keeps getting better. We're especially excited about the doors generative AI is opening for creative capabilities, helping deliver on the premise of getting the right ad to the right user in the right moment. Look at Performance Max. In February, we rolled Gemini into PMax. It's helping curate and generate text and image assets so businesses can meet PMax asset requirements instantly. This is available to all U.S. advertisers and starting to roll out internationally in English, and early results are encouraging. Advertisers using PMax asset generation are 63% more likely to publish a campaign with good or excellent ad strength, and those who improve their PMax ad strength to excellent see 6% more conversions on average. We're also driving improved results for businesses opting into automatically created assets, which are supercharged with generative AI. Those adopting ACA see, on average, 5% more conversions at a similar cost per conversion in Search and Performance Max campaigns. And then there's Dimension. Advertisers are loving its ability to engage new and existing customers and drive purchase consideration across our most immersive and visual touch points like YouTube, Shorts, Gmail and Discover. Hollywood film and TV studio Lionsgate partnered with Horizon Media to test what campaign type will deliver the most ticketing page views for its The Hunger Games: Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes film. Over a three-week test, demand gen was significantly more efficient versus social benchmarks with an 85% more efficient CPC and 96% more efficient cost per page view. Lionsgate has since rolled out demand gen for two new titles. We're also bringing new creative features to demand gen. Earlier this month, we announced new generative image tools to help advertisers create high-quality assets in a few steps with a few simple prompts. This will be a win for up-leveling visual storytelling and testing creative concepts more efficiently. And then there's obviously Search generative experience, which Sundar talked about. I laid out that innovation and the user experience on Search has historically opened up new opportunities for advertisers. We saw this when we successfully navigated from desktop to mobile. We're continuing to experiment with new ad formats, including search and shopping ads alongside search results in SGE. And we shared in March how folks are finding ads either above or below the SGE results helpful. We're excited to have a solid baseline to keep innovating on and confident in the role SGE, including Ads, will play in delighting users and expanding opportunities to meet user needs. Which brings me to Search and our strong performance in the first quarter. In Q1, retail was again the top contributor. Our focus remains on driving profitability and growth for retailers, helping them optimize digital performance for both online and offline as well as innovate across our shopping and merchant experiences. Highlights include continued upsides for retailers, leading into agile budget and bidding strategies across Search, PMax, or both; take-home goods retailer IKEA, who leaned into Google's store sales measurement to understand its total omnichannel revenue opportunity across search. By measuring 2.3x more revenue and using value-based bidding solutions to bid to its omnichannel customers, IKEA drove a significant increase in omni revenue in Q1 and is now scaling this strategy globally. We also expanded local inventory ads into 23 countries, helping drive shopper confidence and offline sales. Retailers can convert intent into action by showcasing in-store availability, pricing, pickup options and more all in one ad format. Moving to YouTube. Last quarter, I went deep into our strategy. It all starts with creation, which drives viewership, which leads to monetization. A few updates to build on Sundar's remarks. First, creation, which is all about giving creators the tools to create amazing content, grow their audiences and build their businesses. In 2023, more people created content on YouTube than ever before, and the number of channels uploading Shorts year-on-year grew 50%. We also hit a new milestone with three million-plus channels in our YouTube Partner Program. We recently shared that YPP has paid out more than any other creator monetization platform, including over $70 billion to creators, artists, and media companies over the last three years. From a viewer's perspective, watch time across YouTube continues to grow, with strength in both Shorts and CTV. According to Nielsen, YouTube has been the leader in U.S. streaming watch time for the last 12-plus months. In the first quarter, Livingroom benefited from a combination of strong watch time growth, innovation in the user and advertiser experience, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Viewers are watching YouTube because they expect to access everything in one place across screens and formats, their favorite creators, live sports, breaking news, educational content, movies, music and more. And advertisers continue to lean in to find audiences they can't find elsewhere. Which brings me to monetization. We're pleased with our Q1 performance across both our ad-supported and subscription offerings. Sundar covered subscription growth. On the Ads front, direct and brand were both strong this quarter. Shorts monetization continued to improve, with Shorts ads now supported on mobile, tablet, Livingroom, and desktop, and available to both performance and brand advertisers. In the U.S., the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing has more than doubled in the past 12 months, including a 10-point sequential improvement in the first quarter alone. Just last week, we introduced new ways for brands to get the most out of their Shorts ads with new lineups on YouTube Select, including sports, beauty, fashion and lifestyle, and entertainment. For YouTube advertisers, increasing brand lift is one of the core goals. In Q1, we saw strong traction from the introduction of a pause ads pilot on connected TVs, a new non-interruptive ad format that appears when users pause their organic content. Initial results show that pause ads are driving strong brand lift results and are commanding premium pricing from advertisers. Before I wrap, two quick highlights on how we're helping our partners transform and accelerate impact with the best across Google. Number one, to help McDonald's build the restaurant of the future, we're deepening our partnership across cloud and ads. Part of this includes them connecting Google Cloud's latest hardware and data technologies across restaurants globally and starting to apply generative AI to enhance its customer and employee experiences. Number two, WPP. At Google Cloud Next, we announced a new collaboration that will redefine marketing through the integration of our Gemini models with WPP Open, WPP's AI-powered marketing operating system, already used by more than 35,000 of its people and adopted by key clients, including The Coca-Cola Company, L'Oreal and Nestle. We're just getting started here and excited about the innovation this partnership will unlock. With that, a huge thank you to our customers and partners, many of whom we're excited to see at Google Marketing Live and Brandcast in just a few weeks. And a huge thank you, as always, to our incredible teams for their agility and hard work this quarter. Ruth, you're up.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. We are very pleased with our financial results for the first quarter driven, in particular, by strength in Search and Cloud as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level, followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the first quarter, our consolidated revenues were $80.5 billion, up 15% or up 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of total expenses, the year-on-year comparisons reflect the impact of the restructuring charges we took in the first quarter of 2023 of $2.6 billion as well as the $716 million in employee severance and related charges in the first quarter of 2024. As you can see in our earnings release, these charges were allocated across the expense lines in other cost of revenues and OpEx based on associated headcount. To help with year-on-year comparisons, we included a table in our earnings release to adjust other cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, and operating margin to exclude the impact of severance and related office space charges in the first quarter of 2023 versus 2024. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $33.7 billion, up 10%. Other cost of revenues was $20.8 billion, up 10% on a reported basis, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs associated with YouTube given the very strong revenue growth in both subscription offerings and ad-supported content. On an adjusted basis, other cost of revenues were up 13% year-on-year. Operating expenses were $21.4 billion, down 2% on a reported basis, primarily reflecting expense decreases in sales and marketing and G&A, offset by an increase in R&D. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. On an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting, first, in R&D, an increase in compensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in sales and marketing, a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense primarily for Cloud sales. Operating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was 32%. On an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31% and our operating margin was 33%. Net income was $23.7 billion and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing 12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14% led again by growth in retail. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion were up 21% driven by both direct response and brand advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%. Subscriptions, platforms and devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%. Google Services operating income was $27.9 billion, up 28%. And the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment. Revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%, reflecting significant growth in GCP with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%. As to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a milestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within Advertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had broad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth driven by brand and direct response. Looking ahead, two points to call out: first, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued to reflect strength in spend from Asia-Pacific based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter of 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the second quarter; second, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the negative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The sequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1 versus Q4 reflects, in part, the fact that we had only one week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in Q1 versus 14 weeks in Q4. Looking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May. With regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in buyers. With respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP infrastructure and solutions as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools. The growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our customers. We continue to invest aggressively while remaining focused on profitable growth. As we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth comparisons across Alphabet: first, Q1 results reflect the benefit of leap year, which contributed slightly more than one point to our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter; second, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus Q1. Turning to margins. Our efforts to durably reengineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis point expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of restructuring and severance charges in both periods. You can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects both actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring. As we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and technical infrastructure. Looking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable us to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. The significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the opportunities offered by AI across our business. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we similarly have work streams underway to enhance overall returns. Finally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share to our capital return program as well as a new $70 billion authorization in share repurchases. The core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing aggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today. Given the extraordinary opportunities ahead, we view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program. Thank you.

There have just been all these new entrants moving around in e-commerce. That is my first one. Then the second one for Ruth, when you talked about sort of more efforts to moderate expense growth from here, can you just sort of give us some examples of areas where you still see the potential for more optimization or work streams in place to continue to durably reengineer the OpEx base as we go throughout 2024.",

Typically, the trends we see carry over well. Overall, I think with generative AI in Search, with our AI overviews, I think we will expand the type of queries we can serve our users. We can answer more complex questions as well as, in general, that all seems to carry over across query categories. Obviously, it's still early, and we are going to be measured and put user experience at the front, but we are positive about what this transition means.",

And I made this point in opening comments, but we are very cognizant of the increasing headwind we have from higher depreciation and expenses associated with the higher CapEx, and so these efforts are ongoing. They are very much the same that we've talked with you about previously. It starts with product and process prioritization, all of the work around organizational efficiency and structure. These are ongoing. And so as an example, the work that Sundar talked about, combining devices and services with our platforms and ecosystems, product area is a really good example because unifying the teams not only helps us deliver higher-quality products and experiences, but we think it enables us to move with greater velocity and efficiency. And then the other work streams we've talked to you about in the past, like all of the work around technical infrastructure, which Sundar alluded to; streamlining operations within the company through the use of AI; what we're doing with procurement with our suppliers and vendors, which he also referenced; the work you've seen on real estate optimization, these are all ongoing work streams, which is why we have them under the umbrella, durably reengineering our cost base, and they are ongoing.",

We've been rolling out AI overviews in the U.S. and the U.K., trying to mainly tackle queries which are more complex, where we think SGE will clearly improve the experience. We've already served billions of queries and it seems to cut across categories, but we are still continuing our testing. We are metrics-driven in these areas.

It really goes to Sundar's opening comment that we're very committed to making the investments required to keep us at the leading edge in technical infrastructure to support the growth in Cloud, all the innovation in Search that he and Philipp have spoken about and our lead with Gemini. I will note that nearly all of the CapEx was in our technical infrastructure. We expect that our investment in office facilities will be about less than 10% of the total CapEx in 2024, roughly flat with our CapEx in 2023, but is still there.

We've definitely been gearing up for this for a long time. You can imagine we started building TPUs in 2016, so we've definitely been gearing up for a long time. The real opportunities we see is the scale of research and innovation, which we have built up and are going to continue to deliver. I think for the first time, we can work on AI in a horizontal way, and it impacts the entire breadth of the company, be it Search, be it YouTube, be it Cloud, be it Waymo and so on. We see a rapid pace of innovation in that underlying. So it's a very leveraged way to do it, and I see that as a real opportunity ahead. In terms of the challenges, I think it's been a mindset shift, which we've been driving across the company to make sure that we are embracing this opportunity but being very efficient in how we are approaching it, making sure we are redirecting our people to the highest priorities across the company, building on our 20 years of experience in driving machine efficiencies year-on-year so that we can put our dollars to work as efficiently as possible.

I think that's what you were referring to. And yes, we're obviously very happy with this development. The way to think about it is advertisers really only spend with us when they see a positive ROI. So you can assume that this wouldn't be happening unless it were to work for advertisers in the short term and also in the long term. That's an important part, I think. Overall, Shorts is a long-term bet for the business. It has really helped us respond to both creator and viewer demand for short-form video. We talked about the strong growth, averaging 70 billion daily views. I mentioned the number of channels uploading has increased 50% year-over-year, so again, very happy with this development.

So it's the growing application and our focus on ensuring that we have the compute capacity to deliver in support of the services and opportunities we see across Alphabet.

And then the second one, just more detail on YouTube and sports rights. Could you reiterate your view on further live sports rights? There's some larger, mostly in the U.S., league rights coming up soon and will be more over the next several years. Could you just talk about your philosophy there beyond NFL Sunday Ticket?",

I think there's speculation that Gemini might be used on iOS in a future state. So the question is, as users start searching on smartphones and those searches are basically rendered on the model, on the phone, without accessing the web, how do you guys anticipate monetizing some of these smartphone-based behaviors that are kind of run on the edge?

I think it gives a new way for people to access Search conveniently wherever they are. We view this as a positive way to bring our services to users in a more seamless manner. So I think it's positive from that perspective. In terms of on-device versus cloud, there will be needs that can be done on-device, and we should help it from a privacy standpoint.

We see an increase in engagement, but I see this as something that will play out over time.

People questioned whether these things would be costly to serve, and we are very confident we can manage the cost of how to serve these queries. People worried about latency. When I look at the progress we have made in latency and efficiency, we feel comfortable. There are questions about monetization. Based on our testing so far, I'm comfortable and confident that we'll be able to manage the monetization transition here well as well. It will play out over time, but I feel we are well positioned. More importantly, when I look at the innovation that's ahead and the way the teams are working hard on it, I am very excited about the future ahead.",

          "content": "Thank you, Jim. And hello, everyone. I'm really pleased with our results this quarter. They showed tremendous ongoing momentum in Search and great progress in Cloud with our AI initiatives driving new growth. Search had another excellent quarter. And in terms of product innovation, we are seeing great progress with AI overviews. In Q2, Cloud reached some major milestones. Quarterly revenues crossed the $10 billion mark for the first time at the same time surpassing the $1 billion mark in quarterly operating profit. Year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for Cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. As I spoke about last quarter, we are uniquely well-positioned for the AI opportunity ahead. Our Research and Infrastructure leadership means we can pursue an in-house strategy that enables our product teams to move quickly. Combined with our model building expertise, we are in a strong position to control our destiny as the technology continues to evolve. Importantly, we are innovating at every layer of the AI stack, from chips to agents and beyond, a huge strength. We are committed to this leadership long-term. This was underscored by the announcements we made at I/O, Cloud Next, and Google Marketing Live, and we'll touch on many of them here. Today, I'll start with Search, then move to our AI momentum more generally, followed by Cloud, YouTube, and some closing thoughts. Let's dive in. Over the past 25 years, we have continued to reimagine and expand Google Search across many technological shifts. With AI, we are delivering better responses on more types of search queries and introducing new ways to search. We are pleased to see the positive trends from our testing continue as we roll out AI overviews, including increases in search usage and increased user satisfaction with the results. People who are looking for help with complex topics are engaging more and keep coming back for AI overviews. And we see even higher engagement from younger users, aged 18 to 24, when they use search with AI overviews. As we have said, we are continuing to prioritize approaches that send traffic to sites across the web. And we are seeing that ads appearing either above or below AI overviews continue to provide valuable options for people to take action and connect with businesses. Beyond AI overviews, AI expands the types of queries we are able to address and opens up powerful new ways to search. Visual search via Lens is one. Soon you'll be able to ask questions by taking a video with Lens. And already we have seen that AI overviews in Lens lead to an increase in overall visual search usage. Another example is Circle to Search, which is available today on more than 100 million Android devices. We are seeing tremendous momentum from our AI investments. More than 1.5 million developers are now using Gemini across our developer tools. And we recently unveiled new models that are more capable and efficient than ever. Gemini now comes in 4 sizes, with each model designed for its own set of use cases. It's a versatile model family that runs efficiently on everything from data centers to devices. At 2 million tokens, we offer the longest context window of any large-scale foundation model to-date, which powers developer use cases that no other model can handle. Gemini is making Google's own products better. All six of our products with more than 2 billion monthly users now use Gemini. This means that Google is the company that's truly bringing AI to everyone. Gemini is powering incredibly helpful features in search, workspace, Google messages, and more. At I/O, we showed new features coming soon to Gmail and to Google Photos. Soon you'll be able to ask photos questions like, 'What did I eat at that restaurant in Paris last year?' For a glimpse of the future, I hope you saw Project Astra at I/O. It shows multimodal understanding and natural conversational capabilities. We've always wanted to build a universal agent and it's an early look at how they can be helpful in daily life. Our AI product advances come from our long-standing foundation of research leadership, as well as our global network of infrastructure. In Q2, we announced our first data center and cloud region in Malaysia and expansion projects in Iowa, Virginia, and Ohio. Our TPUs are a key bet here too. Trillium is the sixth generation of our custom AI accelerator, and it's our best performing and most energy efficient TPU to-date. It achieves a near 5 times increase in peak compute performance per chip and a 67% more energy efficient compared to TPU v5e. And the latest Nvidia Blackwell platform will be coming to Google Cloud in early 2025. We continue to invest in designing and building robust and efficient infrastructure to support our efforts in AI, given the many opportunities we see ahead. Of course, as we do this, we'll continue to create capacity by allocating resources towards our highest priorities. We are relentlessly driving efficiencies in our AI models. For example, over the past quarter, we have made quality improvements that include doubling the core model size for AI overviews while at the same time improving latency and keeping cost per AI overview served flat. And we are focused on matching the right model size to the complexity of the query to minimize the impact on cost and latency. Separately, on our real estate investments, we are taking a measured approach to match the current and future needs of our hybrid workforce as well as our local communities. Next, Google Cloud. We continue to see strong customer interest, winning leading brands like Hitachi, Motorola Mobility, and KPMG. Our deep partnership with Oracle significantly expanded our joint offerings to the large customer base. Our momentum begins with our AI infrastructure, which provides AI startups like Essential AI with leading cost performance for models and high-performance computing applications. We continue to drive fundamental differentiation with new advances since Cloud Next. This includes Trillium, which I mentioned earlier, and A3 Mega powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs, which doubles the networking bandwidth of A3. Our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, helps customers such as Deutsche Bank, Kingfisher, and the US Air Force build powerful AI agents. Last month, we announced a number of new advances. Uber and WPP are using Gemini Pro 1.5 and Gemini Flash 1.5 in areas like customer experience and marketing. We broadened support for third-party models, including Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet and open-source models like Gemma 2, Llama, and Mistral. We are the only cloud provider to offer grounding with Google Search, and we are expanding grounding capabilities with Moody's, MSCI, ZoomInfo, and more. Our AI-powered applications portfolio is helping us win new customers and drive upsell. For example, our conversational AI platform is helping customers like Best Buy and Gordon Food Service. Gemini for Workspace helps Click Therapeutics analyze patient feedback as they build targeted digital treatments. Our AI-powered agents are also helping customers develop better-quality software, find insights from their data, and protect their organizations against cybersecurity threats using Gemini. Software engineers at Wipro are using Gemini code assist to develop, test, and document software faster. Data analysts at Mercado Libre are using BigQuery and Looker to optimize capacity planning and fulfill shipments faster. Cybersecurity risks continue to accelerate, and the number of breaches continue to grow, something we all see in the news every day and that our Mandiant teams help manage. Our strong track record of uptime, quality control, and reliability made Google Cloud the trusted security choice for organizations like Fiserv and Marriott International. In Q2, we infused AI throughout our security portfolio, helping TELUS strengthen its proactive security posture. Turning next to YouTube, YouTube is focused on a clear strategy, connecting creators with a massive audience and enabling them to build successful businesses through ads and subscriptions while helping advertisers reach their desired audience. We had a great Brandcast this quarter, and Philip will say more. I'm pleased with the progress here. YouTube has remained number one in US Streaming watch time, according to Nielsen. Views of YouTube Shorts on connected TVs more than doubled last year. And we are making it easier for creators to add captions and turn regular videos into Shorts. Next, on Android and Pixel. We joined Samsung for their Galaxy Unpacked event a few weeks ago, and we shared that Samsung's new devices will include the latest AI-powered Google updates on Android. It was a great event. I'm looking forward to our Made by Google event happening in August. We'll have lots to share around Android and the Pixel portfolio of devices. Our Pixel line is doing well. We recently introduced the new Pixel 8a powered by our latest Google Tensor G3 chip. It provides beautiful AI experiences like Circle to Search, Best Take, and a Gemini-powered AI assistant. In other bets, I'm really pleased with the progress Waymo's making, a real leader in the space, and getting rave reviews from users. Waymo's served more than 2 million trips to-date and driven more than 20 million fully autonomous miles on public roads. Waymo's now delivering well over 50,000 weekly paid public rides, primarily in San Francisco and Phoenix. In June, we removed the waitlist in San Francisco, so anyone can take a ride. Fully autonomous testing is underway in other Bay Area locations without a human in the driver's seat. Before I close, I want to acknowledge that today is Ruth's final earnings call. Let me take a moment to thank her for all she has done for Google and Alphabet as our longest-serving CFO. I'm excited to continue to work with her in her new role, and I look forward to welcoming our newly appointed CFO, Anat Ashkenazi. She starts next week, and you'll hear from her on our call next quarter. Thanks as always to our employees and partners everywhere for a great Q2. With that, over to you, Philip.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. Starting with performance, Google Services delivered revenues of $73.9 billion for the quarter, up 12% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 14% year-on-year, led by growth in the retail vertical, followed by financial services. YouTube ads revenues were up 13% year-on-year driven by growth and brand as well as direct response. Network revenues declined 5% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues increased 14%, driven again by strong growth in YouTube subscriptions. For the rest of my remarks, I want to double down on two topics: first, how we're applying AI across the marketing process to deliver an even stronger ads experience; second, YouTube's position as the leading multi-format platform. So let me start by sharing some of the ways we are applying AI to bring more performance benefits to even more businesses. Q2 brought several major opportunities to meet and learn from users, developers, creators, and customers. From I/O to Brandcast, Google Marketing Live and Cannes, a growing number of our customers and partners are looking to understand how to successfully incorporate AI into their businesses. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads features and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. This quarter, we announced over 30 new ads features and products to help advertisers leverage AI and keep pace with the evolving expectations of customers and users. Across Search, PMax, DemandGen, and Retail, we're applying AI to streamline workflows, enhance creative asset production, and provide more engaging experiences for consumers. Listening to our customers, retailers in particular have welcomed AI-powered features to help scale the depth and breadth of their assets. For example, as part of a new and easier-to-use merchant center, we've expanded Product Studio, with tools that bring the power of Google AI to every business owner. You can upload a product image from the AI with something like, 'Feature this product with the Paris skyline in the background,' and Product Studio will generate campaign-ready assets. I also hear great feedback from our customers on many of our other new AI-powered features. We're beta testing virtual try-on and shopping ads and plan to roll them out widely later this year. Feedback shows this feature gets 60% more high-quality views than other images and a higher click-out to retailer sites. Our AI-driven profit optimization tools have been expanded to performance max and standard shopping campaigns. Advertisers using profit optimization and smart bidding see a 15% uplift in profit on average compared to revenue-only bidding. Lastly, DemandGen is rolling out to Display in Video 360 and Search Ads 360 in the coming months with new generative image tools that create stunning high-quality image assets for social marketers. As we said at GML, when paired with Search or PMax, DemandGen delivers an average of 14% more conversions. The use cases we're seeing across the industry show the incredible potential of these AI-enabled products to improve performance. Let me briefly share two examples with you. Luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany leveraged DemandGen during the holiday season and saw a 2.5% brand lift in consideration and actions, such as adding items to carts and booking appointments. The campaign drove a 5.6 times more efficient cost per click compared to social media benchmarks. Our own Google marketing team used DemandGen to create nearly 4,500 ad variations for a Pixel 8 campaign shown across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail, delivering twice the click-through rate at nearly a quarter of the cost. In addition to strengthening our ads products for customers, we continue to evolve our existing systems and products with improved models delivering further performance gains. In just six months, AI-driven improvements to quality, relevance, and language understanding have improved Broad Match performance by 10% for advertisers using Smart Bidding. Also, advertisers who adopt PMax to Broad Match and Smart Bidding in their Search campaigns see an average increase of over 25% more conversions or value at a similar cost. We'll continue to listen to our customers and use their feedback to drive innovation across our products. As you can hear, I continue to be excited about the AI era for ads. Now let's turn to YouTube. I've talked before about our approach to making YouTube the best place to create, watch and monetize. First, the best place to create. What sets YouTube apart from every other platform are the creators and the connection they have with their fans. Audiences tuning in to watch their favorite creators continue to grow. For example, two weeks ago, Mr. Beast's channel hit more than 300 million subscribers. Next, the best place to watch. Our long-term investment in CTV continues to deliver. Views on CTV have increased more than 130% in the last three years. According to Nielsen, YouTube is the Number #1 most watched streaming platform on TV screens in the US for the 17th consecutive month. Zooming out, when you look not just at streaming, but at all media companies and their combined TV viewership, YouTube is the second most watched after Disney. And this growth is happening in multiple verticals, including sports, which has seen CTV watch time on YouTube grow 30% year-over-year. Lastly, the best place to monetize. CTV on YouTube is continuing to benefit from a combination of strong watch time growth, viewer and advertiser innovation, and a shift in brand advertising budgets from linear TV to YouTube. Our largest advertisers across verticals, including retail, entertainment, telco, and home and personal care, are partnering with creators on ads and organic integrations. Verizon, for example, worked with a YouTube creator and Verizon customer to show them many ways that plans and offerings can be customized to fit people\u2019s lives. Using AI-powered formats, they created sketches in multiple lengths and orientations to serve the right creative to the right viewer and drive people to their site. Verizon's creator ads had a 15% lower CPA and a 38% higher conversion rate versus other ads. Turning to Shorts. Last quarter, I shared that in the US, the monetization rate of YouTube Shorts relative to in-stream viewing is showing a healthy rate of growth. Again, this quarter, we continue to see an improvement in Shorts monetization, particularly in the US. We are also seeing a very encouraging contribution from brand advertising on Shorts, which we launched on the product in Q4 last year. Lastly, a few words on shopping. Last year, viewers watched 30 billion hours of shopping-related videos, and we saw a 25% increase in watch time for videos that help people shop. While it is early days, shopping remains a key area of investment. At GML, we rolled out several product updates to YouTube shopping, helping creators sell products to their viewers. These updates included product tagging, where creators can tag products in their videos for viewers to discover and purchase, product collections, and a new affiliate hub, a one-stop shop for creators to find deals and promotional offers from brands and track their affiliate earnings. With that, I'll finish by saying a huge thank you to Google employees everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. And Ruth, thanks for your amazing leadership and partnership over all these years.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp, and thanks, Sundar, for those kind words. We had another strong quarter, driven in particular by performance in Search and Cloud, as well as the ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base. My comments will be on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I state otherwise. I will start with results at the Alphabet level followed by segment results and conclude with our outlook. For the second quarter, our consolidated revenues were $84.7 billion, up 14% or up 15% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth. In terms of expenses, total cost of revenues was $35.5 billion, up 11%. Other cost of revenues was $22.1 billion, up 14%, with the increase driven primarily by content acquisition costs, followed by depreciation as well as the impact of the Canadian digital services tax, which was applied retroactively. Operating expenses were $21.8 billion, up 5%, primarily reflecting an increase in R&D partially offset by a decline in G&A, with sales and marketing essentially flat to the second quarter of last year. The increase in R&D was driven primarily by compensation, which was affected by lapsing a reduction in valuation-based compensation liabilities in certain other bets in the second quarter last year, followed by depreciation. The largest single factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal matters. Operating income was $27.4 billion, up 26%, and our operating margin was 32%. Net income was $23.6 billion, and EPS was $1.89. We delivered free cash flow of $13.5 billion in the second quarter and $60.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. As a reminder, last year we had a timing benefit in the second and third quarters from a $10.5 billion deferred cash tax payment made in the fourth quarter, which depressed reported free cash flow growth this quarter, and we'll do so again next quarter. We ended the quarter with $101 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Within Google Services, revenues were $73.9 billion, up 12%. Google Search and other advertising revenues of $48.5 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led again by growth in retail, followed by the financial services vertical. YouTube advertising revenues of $8.7 billion were up 13% driven by brand followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 5%. Subscription platforms and devices revenues were $9.3 billion, up 14%, primarily reflecting growth in YouTube subscription revenues. TAC was $13.4 billion, up 7%. Google Services operating income was $29.7 billion, up 27%, and the operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $10.3 billion for the quarter, up 29%, reflecting first significant growth in GCP, which was above growth for cloud overall and includes an increasing contribution from AI, and second, strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud delivered operating income of $1.2 billion and an operating margin of 11%. As to our Other Bets for the second quarter, revenues were $365 million, and the operating loss was $1.1 billion. Turning to our outlook for the business. With respect to Google Services, first, within advertising. The strong performance of search was broad-based across verticals. In YouTube, we are pleased with the growth in the quarter. We had healthy watch time growth, continued to close the monetization gap in Shorts, and had continued momentum in Connected TV, with brand benefiting in part from an ongoing shift in budgets from linear television to digital. As we look forward to the third quarter, we will be lapping the increasing strength in advertising revenues in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Turning to subscriptions, platforms, and devices. First, we continue to have significant growth in our subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. However, there was a sequential decline in the year-on-year growth rate as we anniversaried the impact of a price increase for YouTubeTV in the second quarter last year. The impact will persist through the balance of the year. Second, with regard to platforms, we are pleased with the performance in play driven by an increase in buyers. Finally, with respect to devices, the most important point as we look forward is that our Made by Google launches have been pulled forward into the third quarter from the fourth quarter last year benefiting revenues in Q3 this year. Turning to cloud, which continued to deliver very strong results. For the first time, Cloud crossed $10 billion in quarterly revenues and $1 billion in quarterly operating profit. As Sundar noted year-to-date, our AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions for cloud customers have already generated billions in revenues and are being used by more than 2 million developers. We're particularly encouraged that the majority of our top 100 customers are already using our generative AI solutions. We continue to invest aggressively in the business. Turning to margins, the margin expansion in Q2 versus last year reflects our ongoing efforts to durably reengineer our cost base, as well as revenue strength. Our leadership team remains focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in order to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. Once again, headcount declined quarter-on-quarter, which reflects both actions we have taken in the first half of the year and a much slower pace of hiring. Looking ahead, we expect a slight increase in headcount in the third quarter as we bring on new graduates. As we have discussed previously, we\u2019re continuing to invest in top engineering and technical talent, particularly in cloud and technical infrastructure. Looking forward, we continue to expect to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023. However, in the third quarter operating margins will reflect the impact of both the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the higher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure, as well as the increase in cost of revenues due to the pull-forward of hardware launches into Q3. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the second quarter was $13 billion, once again driven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure with the largest component for servers followed by data centers. Looking ahead, we continue to expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the Q1 CapEx of $12 billion, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. With regard to Other Bets, we continue to focus on improving overall efficiencies as we invest for long-term returns. Waymo is an important example of this, with its technical leadership coupled with progress on operational performance. As you will see in the 10-Q, we have chosen to commit to a new multi-year investment of $5 billion. This new round of funding, which is consistent with recent annual investment levels, will enable Waymo to continue to build the world's leading autonomous driving technology company. To close, this is my 56th and last earnings call, 37 of them at Alphabet. So I have a few closing thoughts of gratitude. I've been so proud to be at Google and Alphabet as CFO and to work with some of the smartest people in the world every day. I think we have accomplished a lot in the last nine plus years, and I am confident that progress will continue. Of course, I'm not going far and I'm honored to have my new role, which I've been slowly working my way into during the past 11 months and I look forward to continuing to work with Sundar and our great team. Being CFO of one of the most important companies in the world has been the opportunity and responsibility of a lifetime. Google's mission of advancing technology and bringing information to people throughout the world is as relevant today as it was when I worked on its IPO. Technology has been a catalyst for economic growth throughout human history. The people on this call know that if a technological advancement is not the focus of every business and government, they will be left behind. Underpinning this is the need for sound and responsible investment. That has never been more important than today, and certainly that is Google and Alphabet's focus. I want to end by thanking Googlers around the world for the innovation and commitment that has enabled us to deliver such extraordinary products and services globally. I also want to thank our investors and analysts for your long-term support and your feedback. Thank you. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.",

Maybe from any of your perspectives, can you just sort of talk to us about areas where you've seen faster than expected traction or testing adoption of some of the AI, generative AI capabilities versus slower than expected traction and testing from a Google perspective?

On the consumer side, I am happy with how we\u2019ve introduced products like Search, which has been used for many years, in a way that enhances the experience and adds value. We are seeing progress with our consumer products, although monetization is something we still need to work towards. On the enterprise side, we are at a point where many models are emerging, generally moving towards a set of foundational capabilities. The next step is to develop solutions that build on this foundation. We are observing positive use cases in areas like coding and customer service, but it is evident that there is still considerable effort needed to fully realize their potential.",

The reason we consistently emphasize that we are focused on durably reengineering our cost base is that these are extensive work streams and not just tactical fixes, and we are continually building upon them. The main areas we have discussed involve product and process prioritization, as well as organizational efficiency and structure. This is evident in our reduction in headcount compared to the previous year. Our entire leadership team remains dedicated to executing these strategies. As for recent examples, we talked last quarter about merging the devices and services product area with the platforms and ecosystems product area, which we announced back in April. We noted last quarter that unifying teams across these organizations enhances product execution, with our focus on increasing velocity and efficiency. This yields ongoing benefits. More broadly, we continue to concentrate on the various work streams we've mentioned before, one of which is efficiency efforts relating to technical infrastructure. We are also advancing the use of AI across Alphabet, further developing our centralized procurement organization, and optimizing our real estate portfolio.

And then, Sundar, just as it relates to AI overviews, you talked about the positive trends there.

It will also reflect higher expenses associated with the Pixel launch, due to the pull forward. So those are important factors. I would say, overall company-wide, it is important to note that we do expect to continue to deliver full year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023, but I did want to highlight those important points as we look forward to Q3.",

And as you have probably noticed at GML, we announced that soon we'll actually start testing Search and Shopping ads in AI overviews for users in the US, and they will have the opportunity to appear within the overview in a section clearly labeled as sponsored, when they're relevant to both the query and the information in the AI overview, really giving us the ability to innovate here and take this to the next level.",

It's crucial to understand that the slowdown in year-on-year revenue growth from the second quarter compared to the first quarter is largely due to tougher comparisons with the first quarter of last year, when YouTube was experiencing negative year-on-year growth. Additionally, the first quarter had an advantage due to the leap year. YouTube is also facing comparisons to the surge in APAC-based retailers that started in the second quarter of last year, along with foreign exchange challenges we've mentioned. So, there are timing factors at play here, but we want to emphasize the underlying operational strength. Back to you, Philipp.",

People are deeply engaging with Gemini models across Vertex and AI studio. We now have over 2 million developers playing around with these things, and you are definitely seeing early use cases. But I think we are in this phase where we have to deeply work and make sure on these use cases, on these workflows.

And then the other component within that line is Google One that also delivered strong subscriber and revenue growth. I think the heart of your question is really around YouTube, and that is the heart of the revenues in that line. So it continues to be very strong. We see a lot of takers, and strong subscriber growth, we are really pleased with it. We did note that growth on that line decelerated due to anniversaried the YouTube TV price increase.

This approach also drives growth in Cloud and supports our long-term innovative initiatives. I believe that during such a curve, the risk of under-investing far outweighs the risk of over-investing. Even if we were to over-invest, these are infrastructures that are broadly beneficial to us, have long useful lives, and can be applied across various areas. The greater concern, in my opinion, is the potential downside of not investing to remain at the forefront. We pay close attention to every dollar we invest. Our teams work incredibly hard, and I'm proud of the efficiency improvements we've made, whether it's optimizing hardware, software, or deploying models across our operations. We dedicate a lot of time to these efforts, and that shapes our approach. Regarding your second question about scaling loss and whether we are encountering limitations, I believe we are all pushing ourselves and there will be initiatives that enhance our computing capacity and push the capabilities of these models. No matter how that unfolds, I believe the optimizations we are implementing are consistently advancing the capabilities of the models.

          "content": "Thank you, Jim, and hello, everyone. Q3 was another great quarter. The momentum across the company is extraordinary, as you've seen in recent product launches, and as you will hear on the call today. Our commitment to innovation as well as a long-term focus and investment in AI are paying off and driving success for the company and for our customers. We are uniquely positioned to lead in the era of AI because of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation, and we are now seeing this operate at scale. It has three components. First, a robust AI infrastructure that includes data centers, chips, and a global fiber network. Second, world-class research teams who are advancing our work with deep technical AI research and who are also building the models that power our efforts. And third, a broad global reach through products and platforms that touch billions of people and customers around the world, creating a virtuous cycle. Let me quickly touch on each of these. We continue to invest in state-of-the-art infrastructure to support our AI efforts from the U.S. to Thailand to Uruguay. We are also making bold clean energy investments, including the world's first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy from multiple small modular reactors, which will enable up to 500 megawatts of new 24/7 carbon-free power. We are also doing important work inside our data centers to drive efficiencies while making significant hardware and model improvements. For example, we shared that since we first began testing AI Overviews, we have lowered machine cost per query significantly. In 18 months, we reduced cost by more than 90% for these queries through hardware, engineering, and technical breakthroughs while doubling the size of our custom Gemini model. And of course, we use and offer our customers a range of AI accelerator options, including multiple classes of NVIDIA GPUs and our own custom-built TPUs. We are now on the sixth generation of TPUs known as Trillium and continue to drive efficiencies and better performance with them. Turning to research, our team at Google DeepMind continues to drive our leadership. Let me take a moment to congratulate Demis Hassabis and John Jumper on winning the Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on AlphaFold. This is an extraordinary achievement and underscores the incredible talent we have and how critical our world-leading research is to the modern AI revolution and to our future progress. Also, congratulations to Jeff Vinton, who spent over a decade here on winning the Nobel Prize in physics. Our research teams also drive our industry-leading Gemini model capabilities, including long context understanding, multimodality, and agentive capabilities. By any measure\u2014token volume, API calls, consumer usage\u2014business adoption and usage of the Gemini models is in a period of dramatic growth. And our teams are actively working on performance improvements and new capabilities for our range of models. Stay tuned. And they are building out experiences where AI can see and reason about the world around you. Project Astra is a glimpse of that future. We are working to ship experiences like this as early as 2025. We then work to bring those advances to consumers and businesses. Today, all seven of our products and platforms with more than 2 billion monthly users use Gemini models. That includes the latest product to surpass the 2 billion user milestone, Google Maps. Beyond Google's own platforms, following strong demand, we are making Gemini even more broadly available to developers. Today, we shared that Gemini is now available on GitHub Copilot with more to come. To support our investments across these three pillars, we are organizing the company to operate with speed and agility. We recently moved the Gemini app team to Google DeepMind to speed up deployment of new models and streamline post-training work. This follows other structural changes that have unified teams in research, machine learning infrastructure, our developer teams, as well as our security efforts and our platforms and devices team. This is all helping us move faster. For instance, it was a small dedicated team that built Notebook LM, an incredibly popular product that has so much promise. We're also using AI internally to improve our coding processes, which is boosting productivity and efficiency. Today, more than a quarter of all new code at Google is generated by AI, and then reviewed and accepted by engineers. This helps our engineers do more and move faster. I'm energized by our progress and the opportunities ahead, and we continue to be laser-focused on building great products. Let me turn now to the quarterly highlights. In search, recent advancements, including AI Overviews, Circle to Search, and new features in Lens are transforming the user experience, expanding what people can search for and how they search for it. This leads to users coming to search more often for more of their information needs, driving additional search queries. Just this week, AI Overview started rolling out to more than 100 new countries and territories. It will now reach more than 1 billion users on a monthly basis. We are seeing strong engagement, which is increasing overall search usage and user satisfaction. People are asking longer and more complex questions and exploring a wider range of websites. What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn that Google can answer more of their questions. The integration of ads within AI Overviews is also performing well, helping people connect with businesses as they search. Circle to Search is now available on over 150 million Android devices with people using it to shop, translate text, and learn more about the world around them. A third of the people who have tried Circle to Search now use it weekly, a testament to its helpfulness and potential. Meanwhile, Lens is now used for over 20 billion visual searches per month. Lens is one of the fastest-growing query types we see on search because of its ability to answer complex multimodal questions and help in product discovery and shopping. For all these AI features, it's just the beginning, and you will see a rapid pace of innovation and progress here. Next, Google Cloud. I'm very pleased with our growth. This business has real momentum and the overall opportunity is increasing as customers embrace GenAI. We generated Q3 revenues of $11.4 billion, up 35% over last year, with operating margins of 17%. Our technology leadership and AI portfolio are helping us attract new customers, win larger deals, and drive 30% deeper product adoption with existing customers. Customers are using our products in five different ways. First, our AI infrastructure, which we differentiate with leading performance driven by storage, compute, and software advances, as well as leading reliability and a leading number of accelerators. Using a combination of our TPUs and GPUs, LG AI research reduced inference processing time for its multimodal model by more than 50% and operating costs by 72%. Second, our enterprise AI platform, Vertex, is used to build and customize the best foundation models from Google and the industry. Gemini API calls have grown nearly 40x in a 6-month period. When Snap was looking to power more innovative experiences within their My AI chatbot, they chose Gemini's strong multimodal capabilities. Since then, Snap saw over 2.5 times as much engagement with My AI in the United States. Third, customers use our AI platform together with our data platform, BigQuery, because we analyze multimodal data no matter where it is stored with ultra-low latency access to Gemini. This enables accurate real-time decision-making for customers like Hiscox, one of the flagship syndicates in Lloyd's of London, which reduced the time it took to code complex risks from days to minutes. These types of customer outcomes, which combine AI with data science, have led to 80% growth in BigQuery ML operations over a 6-month period. Fourth, our AI-powered cybersecurity solutions, Google Threat Intelligence and Security operations are helping customers like BBVA and Deloitte prevent, detect, and respond to cybersecurity threats much faster. We have seen customer adoption of our Mandiant-powered threat detection increased 4x over the last 6 quarters. Fifth, in Q3, we broadened our applications portfolio with the introduction of our new customer engagement suite. It's designed to improve the customer experience online and in mobile apps, as well as in call centers, retail stores, and more. A great example is Volkswagen of America, who is using this technology to power its new myVW Virtual Assistant. In addition, the employee agents we delivered through Gemini for Google Workspace are getting superb reviews. 75% of daily users say it improves the quality of their work. Moving now to YouTube. For the first time ever, YouTube's combined ad and subscription revenue over the past four quarters has surpassed $50 billion. Together, YouTube TV, NFL Sunday Ticket, and YouTube Music Premium are driving subscription growth for the platform. And we are leaning into the living room experience with multi-view and a new option for creators to organize content into episodes and seasons, similar to traditional TV. At Made on YouTube, we announced that Google DeepMind's most capable model for video generation VO is coming to YouTube Shorts to help creators later this year. Next, platforms and devices. Gemini's deep integration is improving Android. For example, Gemini Live lets you have free-flowing conversations with Gemini. People love it. It's available on Android, including Samsung Galaxy devices. We continue to work closely with them to deliver innovations across their newest devices with much more to come. At Made by Google, we unveiled our latest Pixel 9 series of devices featuring advanced AI models, including Gemini Nano. We have seen strong demand for these devices, and they've already received multiple awards. Turning to Other Bets. I want to highlight Waymo, the biggest part of our portfolio. Waymo is now a clear technical leader within the autonomous vehicle industry and creating a growing commercial opportunity. Over the years, Waymo has been infusing cutting-edge AI into its work. Now each week, Waymo is driving more than 1 million fully autonomous miles and serves over 150,000 paid rides, the first time any AV company has reached this kind of mainstream use. Through its expanded network and operations partnership with Uber in Austin and Atlanta, plus a new multiyear partnership with Hyundai, Waymo will bring fully autonomous driving to more people and places. By developing a universal driver, Waymo has multiple paths to market. And with its sixth-generation system, Waymo significantly reduced unit costs without compromising safety. Before I close, I'm delighted to welcome our new CFO, Anat. We are thrilled to have her on board, and you will hear from her shortly. And as always, I want to express my gratitude to our employees worldwide. Your dedication and hard work have made this another exceptional quarter for Alphabet. Now over to you, Philipp.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I'll start with performance for the quarter and then describe the progress we're seeing across ads, YouTube, and partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is already having on our business. Google Services delivered revenues of $76.5 billion for the quarter, up 13% year-on-year. Search and other revenues grew 12% year-on-year, led by growth in the financial services vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube ads revenues grew 12% year-on-year, driven by brand, closely followed by direct response. Network revenues were down 2% year-on-year. In subscriptions, platforms, and devices, year-on-year revenues were up 28%, driven by growth in subscriptions as well as the launch of our Made by Google devices in the third quarter. Before I double-click into ads, YouTube, and partnerships, a few comments on search. Whether they're using their voice to find answers on the go or opening their camera to explore the world around them, people are expanding how they ask questions in search as well as the type of questions they ask. New behaviors create new opportunities to help us connect businesses and consumers via amazing commercial experiences. As GenAI expands what's possible, we continue to see a significant opportunity in search. Let me take a minute to explain why. AI really supercharges search. Our new AI-powered features make searches more helpful, and we continue to see great feedback, particularly from younger users. For example, with Circle to Search, where we see higher engagement from users aged 18 to 24. AI is expanding our ability to understand intent and connect it to our advertisers. This allows us to connect highly relevant users with the most helpful ad and deliver business impact to our customers. Let me share two new ad experiences we have rolled out alongside our popular AI-powered features in search. First, as you heard from Sundar, every month, Lens is used for almost 20 billion visual searches, with 1 in 4 of these searches having commercial intent. In early October, we announced product search on Google Lens. And in testing this feature, we found that shoppers are more likely to engage with content in this new format. We're also seeing that people are turning to Lens more often to run complex multimodal queries, voicing a question or inputting text in addition to a visual. Given these new user behaviors, earlier this month, we announced the rollout of shopping ads above and alongside relevant Lens visual search results to help better connect consumers and businesses. Second, AI Overviews, where we have now started showing search and shopping ads within the overview for mobile users in the U.S. As you remember, we've already been running ads above and below AI Overviews. We're now seeing that people find ads directly within AI Overviews helpful because they can quickly connect with relevant businesses, products, and services to take the next step at the exact moment they need. As I've said before, we believe AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain. Let's start with creative. Advertisers now use our Gemini-powered tools to build and test a larger variety of relevant creatives at scale. Audi used our AI tools to generate multiple video images and text assets in different links and orientations out of existing long-form videos. It then fed the newly generated creatives into demand gen to drive reach, traffic, and booking to their driving experience. The campaign increased website visits by 80% and increased clicks by 2.7 times, delivering a lift in their sales. Last week, we updated image generation at Google Ads with our most advanced text-to-image model, Imagine 3, which we tuned using ads performance data from multiple industries to help customers produce high-quality imagery for their campaigns. Advertisers can now create even higher-performing assets for PMax, Demand Gen app, and Display campaigns. Turning to media buying. AI-powered campaigns help advertisers get faster feedback on what creatives work, where, and redirect their media buying. Using Demand Gen, DoorDash tested a mix of image and video assets to drive more impact across Google and YouTube's visually immersive surfaces. They saw a 15 times higher conversion rate at a 50% more efficient cost per action when compared to video action campaigns alone. Last and most importantly, measurement. This quarter, we extended availability of our open-source marketing mix model, Meridian, to more customers, helping to scale measurement of cross-channel budgets to drive better business outcomes. On YouTube, we remain focused on building a platform that enables creators to thrive and unlocking a whole new world of creativity with AI. Creators are at the heart of the YouTube ecosystem, and the content they are making is driving robust growth in watch time across the platform. We're also using AI to greatly improve recommendations on YouTube. Driven by Gemini, our large language models have a deeper understanding of video content and viewers' preferences. As a result, they can recommend more relevant, fresher, and personalized content to the viewer. Short-form creation continues to thrive on YouTube. Shorts monetization improved again this quarter, and we continue to significantly close the gap with in-stream video, particularly in the U.S. and other more highly monetizing markets. Of all the channels uploading to YouTube each month, 70% are uploading shorts. And we recently announced a top requested feature, the ability to upload shorts up to 3 minutes long. Also, advertisers can now book first position on Shorts blocks in close to 40 markets. We're unlocking more opportunities in the living room. Our momentum here continues as we maintain our status as the number one streamer in the U.S. according to Nielsen. This is driven by the strength of our creators, such as Michelle Carr and Rhett & Link, who are increasingly crafting experiences designed specifically for the big screen, and it's paying off. The number of creators making the majority of YouTube revenue on TV screens is up more than 30% year-on-year. YouTube is becoming a premier destination for sports watching. People come for the game and stay for the commentary and around-the-game content from creators like Evelyn Gonzalez, Adam W, and Brad Coleman. During the Olympics, content from Paris 2024 had over 12 billion views on YouTube. More than 850 million unique viewers watched over 40 billion minutes of content with 35% on their TV screens. And recently, we kicked off our second season of NFL Sunday Ticket on YouTube TV, which continues to receive a positive reception from advertisers, our partners at the NFL, and fans. We have continued to invest in our product experience with improvements to multiview and deeper integrations for fantasy football fans. Following up on my remarks from last quarter about Brandcast, we had a strong upfront performance with commitments up about 20% year-on-year. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships. More and more of our partners are recognizing the breadth of our technologies and building solutions that leverage the very best of Google. For example, our recently announced strategic partnership with Vodafone Group spans Google Cloud, AI, Android ads, and digital services. This multibillion-dollar partnership will bring these technologies to more than 330 million customers across Europe and Africa. We are collaborating on more than 30 initiatives across 7 areas, including generative AI from consumers, a best-in-class TV platform, hardware, and cybersecurity. With that, a heartfelt thank you to Google everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued collaboration and trust. Anat, welcome to the team. It's great to have you with us.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. And thanks, Sundar, for the words of welcome. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and will then cover our segment results. I'll end with high-level commentary on investment at the Alphabet level. We had another strong quarter in Q3 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue increased by 15% or 16% in constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by a robust 35% growth in cloud. Total cost of revenue was $36.5 billion, up 10%. Tech was $13.7 billion, up 9%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenue, which have a much higher TAC rate, declined. Other costs of revenue were $22.8 billion, up 11%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, an increase in depreciation associated with a higher level of investment in our technical infrastructure, and higher hardware costs associated with the pull forward of our Made by Google launches from the fourth to the third quarter. Total operating expenses increased 5% to $23.3 billion. The increase was primarily driven by facilities-related charges as a result of actions taken to further optimize our office space footprint globally, followed by depreciation, partially offset by year-on-year decline in charges for legal and other matters. R&D investments increased by 11%, primarily driven by increases in compensation and depreciation expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased 5%, primarily reflecting investment in advertising and promotional efforts related to the Made by Google launches, as well as for AI and Gemini. G&A expenses declined by 10%, primarily due to lower charges for legal and other matters. Operating income increased 34% to $28.5 billion, and operating margin increased to 32%. Net income increased 34% to $26.3 billion and earnings per share increased 37% to $2.12. We're pleased with the progress we're making in reengineering our cost structure, which is reflected in our operating margin expansion this quarter, while also continuing to invest in the business to bring innovation to consumers, creators, and enterprises. We delivered free cash flow of $17.6 billion for the third quarter and $55.8 billion for the trailing 12 months. Year-on-year free cash flow was negatively impacted by the following items. In 2023, we deferred cash tax payments from the second and third quarters to the fourth quarter. And in Q3 2024, we made a $3 billion cash payment related to the 2017 EC shopping fine. We ended the quarter with $93 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now turning to segment results. Google Services revenue increased 13% to $76.5 billion. Google Search and other advertising revenue increased by 12% to $49.4 billion. The robust performance of search was broad-based across verticals, led by the financial services vertical due to strength in insurance followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 12% to $8.9 billion, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. As Philipp mentioned, we're seeing strong momentum in YouTube, including robust growth in watch time across the platform and are excited about the new features and products we're bringing to creators. Network advertising revenue of $7.5 billion was down 2%. In the third quarter, the year-on-year growth in all our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q3 of last year, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and devices revenue increased 28% to $10.7 billion, reflecting growth in subscription revenues, as well as the launch of our Made by Google devices in the third quarter. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, driven primarily by YouTube TV and YouTube Music Premium, as well as Google One, primarily due to increases in the number of paid subscribers. With regards to platforms, we're pleased with the performance in Play, primarily driven by an increase in buyers. Google Service operating income increased by 29% to $30.9 billion, and operating margin was 40%. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 35% to $11.4 billion in the third quarter, reflecting accelerated growth in GCP across AI infrastructure, generative AI solutions, and core GCP products. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was higher than cloud overall. We also saw strong Google Workspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat. As you just heard from Sundar, the robust innovation and expanded AI offerings within our cloud business are allowing existing and new customers to realize measurable business benefits, including reduced cost, greater customer engagement, faster response time, and better revenue conversion. Google Cloud operating income increased to $1.9 billion, and operating margin increased to 17%. The operating margin expansion was driven by strong revenue performance across cloud AI products, core GCP, and Workspace, as well as ongoing efficiency initiatives. As to our Other Bets, for the third quarter, revenues were $388 million, and the operating loss was $1.1 billion. I'll highlight just a couple of accomplishments in the quarter for Waymo and Wing. We're excited about the progress we're seeing in Waymo, as Sundar mentioned, and the increase in the number of paid rides. We're planning to continue to expand our geographic coverage and reach more customers in existing markets and new markets. Wing, our drone delivery company, recently passed the one-year anniversary of scaling its partnership with Walmart in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, now operating in 11 stores and serving 26 different cities and towns. Turning to Alphabet level activities. The largest component of this line is our investment in AI research and development activities, which support all of Alphabet. There were two notable items that impacted the operating loss in Alphabet level activities. First, a $607 million charge related to decisions we've made to further optimize our physical footprint and office space globally; and second, our ongoing investments in AI R&D, including the full quarter effect of the organizational changes we've made in May to move some additional AI teams from Google Services to Google DeepMind. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the third quarter was $13 billion, reflecting an investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers and networking equipment. Looking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx in the fourth quarter to be at similar levels to Q3, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly reported CapEx. Our expansion of data center capacity is expected to bring economic benefits to countries and communities where we are investing. In the third quarter alone, we made announcements of over $7 billion in planned data center investments, with nearly $6 billion of that in the U.S. In Q3, we also returned value to shareholders in the form of $15.3 billion in share repurchases and $2.5 billion in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion over the trailing 12 months to shareholders. As we look forward, we're working to balance our investments in AI and other growth areas with the cost discipline needed to fund those activities. As we think about the remainder of 2024, there are a couple of dynamics to consider. In terms of revenue, year-on-year growth in advertising revenue will continue to be impacted by the increasing strength in advertising revenue in the second half of 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. And there will be a headwind to year-over-year growth in subscription platforms and devices revenue in the fourth quarter due to the pull forward of our Made by Google launches into the third quarter this year. In terms of expenses, we'll continue to see increases in depreciation and expenses associated with a higher level of investment in our technical infrastructure, partially offset by a slight benefit from the cost revenue associated with our devices due to the pull forward of hardware launches into Q3. Now before going into Q&A, as the new CFO, I would like to share a few thoughts on how I'm approaching and thinking through growth, cost structure, and capital allocation and expect to hear more from me on these topics in the coming quarters. As I look at the business, I see opportunities for further growth propelled by AI and the underlying momentum across the business. You heard about some of these on the call today. I also believe that we are well positioned to deliver meaningful innovation, which will translate to revenue given our strength in the core pillars that are required to succeed in AI at scale. Realizing those opportunities and great innovation in AI requires global reach, which we have through our products and platforms, as well as continued meaningful capital investment. And while we have a strong balance sheet to be able to support these investments, we will be looking for efficiencies so that we can fund innovation in priority areas. Sundar, Ruth, and our leadership team started important work to reengineer our cost structure, including efforts such as optimizing our headcount growth, our physical footprint, and improving the efficiencies of our technical infrastructure and streamlining operations across the company through the use of AI. I plan to build on these efforts, but also evaluate where we might be able to accelerate work and where we might need to pivot to free up capital for more attractive opportunities. Thank you.

And then the second one, just as we're sort of thinking through constraints to how quickly they come out, what are sort of the key constraints that you see to really reimagining search and scaling it out across 2 billion to 3 billion people?

I mentioned in my remarks about Circle to Search, Lens, now with video search approaching over 20 billion queries a month, and obviously, AI Overviews. And with each of these changes, we are definitely expanding what's possible in search. It's been really heartening to see users adapt. They understand they can ask more queries. They come back more often. And so we have seen growth there. I think we are with very\u2014while we've rolled out AI Overviews to over 1 billion users, there is a lot more innovation there we are actively working on. So I expect search to continue to evolve significantly in 2025, both in the search product and in Gemini. And so I think that's the opportunity ahead. I think we are in early days of what is a powerful new technology. With it, I think we can do a lot more for our users, but at the same time, underpin it on the foundational bedrock of quality, trust, and user experience, which we have always done. So we are at 1 billion people. I don't necessarily see a constraint there. Obviously, things like latency, cost per query, etc. But as you've seen us over the past 18 months make substantial progress. So we'll continue rolling it out more, and we'll keep evolving it. I think search, if I were to take a 12-month outlook, is going to continue to evolve and we'll be at the forefront of that innovation.",

I couldn't be more excited about the forward-looking roadmap, but all of it allows us to both plan ahead for the future and really drive an optimized architecture for it. Because of all this, both we can have best-in-class efficiency, not just for internal use at Google, but what we can provide through cloud, and that's reflected in the growth we saw in our AI infrastructure and GenAI services on top of it.

As you saw in the quarter, we invested $13 billion in CapEx across the company. As you think about it, really it's divided into two categories. One is our technical infrastructure, and that's the majority of that $13 billion. The other one goes into areas such as facilities, the Bets, and other areas across the company. Within TI, we have investments in servers, which includes both TPUs and GPUs. The second categories are data centers and networking equipment. This quarter, approximately 60% of that investment in technical infrastructure went towards servers and about 40% towards data center and networking equipment. As you think about them, we offer both GPUs and TPUs internally and to our customers. We have choices and options based on what our customer needs and what our internal needs are. As you think about the next quarter and going into next year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we will be investing in Q4 at approximately the same level of what we've invested in Q3, approximately $13 billion. As we think into 2025, we do see an increase coming in 2025, and we will provide more color on that on the Q4 call, likely not the same percent step-up that we saw between '23 and '24, but additional increase.",

We are doing the same for internal use as well.

We are also striking partnerships in newer and unique ways. Hence, the Uber partnership and expansion to Austin and Atlanta.

The gap continues to narrow, particularly in the U.S. We also see it in other more highly monetizing markets. We continue to work very closely with our advertisers. We're committed to providing them with effective ways to reach the growing audience here. I talked about advertisers now being able to book first position on Shorts blocks. That's exciting.

The second question is, I'm sure this is something you guys have been thinking about for a while, but it looks like the way that the Google versus DOJ search trial is going, there's a decent likelihood that the Apple ISA contract and some of the Android pre-install contracts are going to be voided out at some point in the future. So I guess the question is, what plans do we have in place to recapture some of the usage that might be going away in those search access points?

We are getting it across our products. The Gemini app itself has very strong momentum on user growth. Our API volume, I commented on the Gemini APIs having gone up 14x in the past 6 months. So we are seeing growth across the board. The Gemini integration into Google Assistant is going super well on Android. The user feedback is positive. We are continuing to roll that out more. I think you'll see us\u2014we are investing in the next generation of models. We are investing in scaling up the usage of the\u2014both directly to the models as well as on the consumer and the developer side. We see good momentum there. On the second - on the legal trials, obviously, I don't want to - it's not appropriate for me to speculate given it's in the middle of ongoing litigation. But stepping back, look, we've always and even as the court acknowledged, that we have reached a position of success because we have deeply innovated, and we are continuing to do so. People have chosen us because they view it as the best product, both for consumers and partners. We have a long track record of working hard to ensure our products are as easily available to users as possible across all platforms. So that approach and all the learnings over the years will give us a strong foundation. First of all, we plan to vigorously defend these cases.

It's one of the most positive user satisfaction launches we've done in search. It is increasing overall search usage, like people are asking more complex questions and different types of questions. They're exploring a wider range of websites. What's particularly exciting is that this growth actually increases over time as people learn to adapt to that new behavior.

We've had two generations of Gemini model. We are working on the third generation, which is progressing well. Teams internally are now set up much better to consume the underlying model innovation and translate that into innovation within their products. All seven products, which have 2 billion users, have done their first versions of incorporating Gemini, and there is an aggressive road map ahead for 2025. I mentioned earlier, search alone. I think there's a lot more we can do. We are also enabling smaller teams to ship newer experiences, and Notebook LM was the first instantiation of those types of efforts. Through it all, within, we had to do this when the company evolved from desktop to mobile. We are restructuring the company. Effectively, if you think of Google as a neural network, we are forming new synapses, which work much better to adapt to this moment. I think that sets us up well for the year ahead.

But how do you think about the margin trends that you're seeing?

The second question is, across the board, when you think about the business that ran at 32% operating margins this last quarter, and you come in looking at this fresh, is it clear to you that there are a lot of newfound cost efficiencies or ongoing cost efficiencies? What do you see as the biggest opportunities to take those margins and maybe, over time, take them materially higher? Thank you very much.",

Really outstanding work by our cloud team to drive continued benefits to customers. As you think about that margin expansion, it's a few things. You've mentioned one of them. The first is scale. Obviously, as we scale the business, we have more opportunities for margin expansion. The second, and shouldn't be underestimated, is the work the team has done to drive efficiencies across the cloud business. We're seeing those efficiencies come through, whether it's through headcount management or facilities management or other process efficiencies\u2014driving results you're seeing this quarter. It's hard to compare to any of our peers or competitors. It's a different business, but more to come. One thing to remember, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is that this is an area requiring investment. A lot of these investments in servers, etc., are based on demand we're seeing from customers. So this will translate to revenue in the fairly short term. But that means headwinds associated with the overall annual run rate or costs tied to these investments, whether in the form of depreciation or just construction costs not capitalized. We'll continue to drive efficiency in the business to try to offset some of these costs. But this is how I'm viewing the dynamics for cloud. Overall, for the business, this is one of my key priorities\u2014to look across the organization to see what we can do in terms of driving further efficiencies. Great work has been done started by Ruth, Sundar, and the rest of the leadership team to reengineer the cost base, but I think any organization can always push a little further. I'll be looking for additional opportunities across all the elements mentioned in my prepared remarks\u2014not just the size of the organization but also how we operate and run the business. Simplifying the organization, as Sundar just mentioned, also means using AI within our processes and how we complete work to find some efficiencies or opportunities for efficiencies. All of that will go against substantial increases in capital investment, as I've mentioned, going into 2025. I'll provide more color in the Q4 call.

We work hard to stay a step ahead and anticipate. That's why we've really brought multimodality on the input and output sides of search pretty natively. We'll continue expanding innovations there. Having two surfaces for us allows us to experiment more. I view this moment as a moment in which there are new use cases we will be able to do, which we couldn't have done before.

          "content": "Thanks, Jim, and hello, everyone. We delivered another strong quarter in Q4, driven by our leadership in AI and our unique full stack. We're making dramatic progress across compute, model capabilities, and in driving efficiencies. We're rapidly shipping product improvements, and seeing terrific momentum with consumer and developer usage. And we're pushing the next frontiers, from AI agents, reasoning and deep research, to state-of-the-art video, quantum computing and more. The company is in a great rhythm and cadence, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. This is translating into product usage, revenue growth, and results. In Search, AI overviews are now available in more than 100 countries. They continue to drive higher satisfaction in Search usage. Meanwhile, circle to search is now available on over 200 million Android devices. In Cloud and YouTube, we said at the beginning of 2024 that we expected to exit the year at a combined annual revenue run rate of over $100 billion. We met that goal and ended the year at a run rate of $110 billion. We are set up well for continued growth. So today I'll provide an update on our AI progress and how it's improving our core consumer products. Then I'll touch on Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Devices, and Waymo. Let's start with AI. Last quarter, I outlined the three areas of our differentiated full stack approach to AI innovation. Our leading AI infrastructure, our world-class research, including models and tooling, and our products and platforms that bring these innovations to people at scale. First, AI Infrastructure. Our sophisticated global network of cloud regions and data centers provides a powerful foundation for us and our customers, directly driving revenue. We have a unique advantage, because we develop every component of our technology stack, including hardware, compilers, models, and products. This approach allows us to drive efficiencies at every level, from training and serving, to developer productivity. In 2024, we broke ground on 11 new cloud regions and data center campuses in places like South Carolina, Indiana, Missouri, and around the world. We also announced plans for seven new subsea cable projects, strengthening global connectivity. Our leading infrastructure is also among the world's most efficient. Google data centers deliver nearly four times more computing power per unit of electricity compared to just five years ago. These efficiencies, coupled with the scalability, cost, and performance we offer, are why organizations increasingly choose Google cloud's platform. In fact, today, cloud customers consume more than eight times the compute capacity for training and inferencing compared to 18 months ago. We'll continue to invest in our cloud business to ensure we can address the increase in customer demand. Second, world-class research including models. In December, we unveiled Gemini 2.0, our most capable AI model yet, built for the agentic era. We launched an experimental version of Gemini 2.0 Flash, our workhorse model with low latency and enhanced performance. Flash has already rolled out to the Gemini app, and tomorrow we are making 2.0 Flash generally available for developers and customers, along with other model updates. So stay tuned. Late last year, we also debuted our experimental Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Model. The progress-to-scale thinking has been super fast, and the reviews so far have been extremely positive. We are working on even better thinking models and look forward to sharing those with the developer community soon. Gemini 2.0 advances in multi-modality and made of tool use enable us to build new agents that bring us closer to our vision of a universal assistant. One early example is Deep Research. It uses agentic capabilities to explore complex topics on your behalf, and give key findings, along with sources. It launched in Gemini Advanced in December, and is rolling out to Android users all over the world. We are seeing great product momentum with our consumer Gemini app, which debuted on iOS last November. And we have opened up trusted tester access to a handful of research prototypes, including Project Mariner, which can understand and reason across information on a browser screen to complete tasks and Project Astra. We expect to bring features from both to the Gemini app later this year. We're also excited by the progress of our video and image generation models. Veo 2, our state-of-the-art video generation model, and Imagen 3, our highest quality text-to-image model. These generative media models, as well as Gemini, consistently top industry leaderboards and score top marks across industry benchmarks. That's why more than 4.4 million developers are using our Gemini models today, double the number from just six months ago. And we continue to drive research breakthroughs in quantum computing. At the end of last year, we announced Willow, our new state-of-the-art quantum computing chip that can reduce errors exponentially as we scale up using more qubits. Willow is an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications. This technology holds so much promise, which is why there was real excitement around this breakthrough. Third, our Products and Platforms put AI into the hands of billions of people around the world. We have seven Products and Platforms with over 2 billion users and all are using Gemini. That includes Search, where Gemini is powering our AI overviews. People use Search more with AI overviews and usage growth increases over time as people learn that they can ask new types of questions. This behavior is even more pronounced with younger users who really appreciate the speed and efficiency of this new format. We also are pleased to see how Circle to Search is driving additional Search use and opening up even more types of questions. This feature is also popular among younger users. Those who have tried Circle to Search before now use it to start more than 10% of their searches. As AI continues to expand the universe of queries that people can ask, 2025 is going to be one of the biggest years for Search innovation yet. Now, let me turn to key highlights from the quarter across Cloud, YouTube, Platforms and Devices, and Waymo. First, Google Cloud. Our AI-powered cloud offerings enabled us to win customers such as Mercedes-Benz, Mercado Libre, and Servier. In 2024, the number of first-time commitments more than doubled, compared to 2023. We also deepened customer relationships. Last year, we closed several strategic deals over $1 billion, and the number of deals over $250 million doubled from the prior year. Our partners are further accelerating our growth, with customers purchasing billions of dollars of solutions through our Cloud marketplace. We continue to see strong growth across our broad portfolio of AI-powered Cloud solutions. It begins with our AI Hypercomputer, which delivers leading performance and cost, across both GPUs and TPUs. These advantages help Citadel with modeling markets and training, and enabled Wayfair to modernize its platform, improving performance and scalability by nearly 25%. In Q4, we saw strong uptake of Trillium, our sixth-generation TPU, which delivers four times better training performance and three times greater inference throughput compared to the previous generation. We also continue our strong relationship with NVIDIA. We recently delivered their H200-based platforms to customers and just last week, we were the first to announce a customer running on the highly-anticipated Blackwell platform. Our AI developer platform, Vertex AI, saw a fivefold increase in customers year-over-year, with brands like Mondelez International and WPP building new applications and benefiting from our 200+ foundation models. Vertex usage increased 20x during 2024, with particularly strong developer adoption of Gemini Flash, Gemini 2.0, Imagen 3, and most recently, Veo. We are also seeing strong growth in our AI-powered databases, data analytics, and cybersecurity platforms. Customers including Radisson Hotels are now using Gemini to search and analyze multi-modal data from across multiple Clouds. Our AI-powered Threat Intelligence and Security Operations products help customers, including Vodafone and AstraZeneca, identify, protect, and defend against threats. Our growing portfolio of AI applications is also seeing strong customer adoption. In Q4, we introduced Google Agentspace, which helps enterprises synthesize data with Google-quality Search, create Gemini-powered agents, and automate transactions for employees. In addition, we recently gave all Google Workspace Business and Enterprise customers access to all of our powerful Gemini AI capabilities to help boost their productivity. Moving to YouTube. Nielsen data shows YouTube continues to be number one in streaming watchtime in the U.S., with our share of streaming now at a record high. On election day alone, over 45 million viewers across the U.S. watched election-related content on YouTube. Our early investment in podcasts is paying off. We integrated podcasts into the core YouTube experience, particularly with video. We are now the most frequently used service for consuming podcasts in the U.S., according to a recent Edison report. This success reflects our long-term approach of investing in emerging trends, from mobile to the living room. We now have over 250,000 creators in the YouTube Shopping affiliate program in the U.S. and Korea alone. We expanded YouTube Shopping at the end of last year to three additional countries, allowing even more creators to share their favorite products with fans and grow their businesses. Philipp will talk more about YouTube performance later in the call. Next, Platforms and Devices. Google One's performance has been outstanding and is one of our fastest-growing subscription products in terms of subscribers and revenue growth. Last month, we announced the first beta of Android 16, plus new Android updates, including a deeper Gemini integration coming to the new Samsung Galaxy S25 series. We also recently announced Android XR, the first Android platform built for the Gemini era. Created with Samsung and Qualcomm, Android XR is designed to power an ecosystem of next-generation extended reality devices, like headsets and glasses. Finally, a few words on Waymo which made tremendous progress last year, safely serving more than 4 million passenger trips. It is now averaging over 150,000 trips each week, and growing. Looking ahead, Waymo will be expanding its network and operations partnerships to open up new markets, including Austin and Atlanta this year and Miami next year. And in the coming weeks, Waymo One vehicles will arrive in Tokyo for their first international road trip. We're also developing the sixth-generation Waymo Driver, which will significantly lower hardware costs. I want to thank our employees around the world for another great quarter. 2025 is going to be exciting and we're all ready for it.",

          "content": "Thanks, Sundar, and hello, everyone. I will quickly cover performance for the quarter, then frame the rest of my remarks around the progress we are delivering across Search, Ads, YouTube and Partnerships, highlighting the impact AI is having on our business and our customers. Google Services revenues were $84 billion for the quarter, up 10%, driven primarily by an 11% year-on-year growth in advertising revenues. Strong growth in Search and YouTube advertising was partially offset by year-over-year decline in network revenues. In terms of vertical performance, the 13% increase in Search and other revenues was led by financial services followed by retail. The 14% growth in YouTube advertising revenues was driven by strong spend on U.S. election advertising, with combined spend from both parties almost doubling from what we saw in the 2020 elections. Now, in Q4, we saw continued strong growth in revenues from Search. We had lots of exciting updates in December, and we're rapidly integrating our AI innovations into our consumer experiences. We've already started testing Gemini 2.0 in AI overviews and plan to roll it out more broadly later in the year. In Search, we're seeing people increasingly ask entirely new questions using their voice, camera, or in ways that were not possible before, like with Circle to Search. We're making these benefits available to more consumers. Google is already present in over half of journeys where a new brand, product, or retailer is discovered. By offering new ways for people to Search, we're expanding commercial opportunities for our advertisers. Shoppers can now take a photo of a product and, using lens, quickly find information about the product, reviews, similar products, and where they can get it for a great price. Lens is used for over 20 billion visual search queries every month, and the majority of these searches are incremental. Retail was particularly strong this holiday season, especially on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which each generated over $1 billion in ad revenue. Interestingly, despite the U.S. holiday shopping season being the shortest since 2019, retail sales began much earlier, in October, causing the season to extend longer than anticipated. People shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced a reinvented Google shopping experience, rebuilt from the ground up with AI. This December saw roughly 13% more daily active users on Google shopping in the U.S. compared to the same period in 2023. Closing out on Search with travel, and sharing another interesting trend where we saw spend expand to travel Tuesday. This contributed to 20% year-on-year revenue growth for travel advertisers across Cyber Monday and Travel Tuesday. Moving to Ads. We continue investing in AI capabilities across media buying, creative and measurement. As I said before, we believe that AI will revolutionize every part of the marketing value chain, and over the past quarter, we've seen how our customers are increasingly focusing on optimizing their use of AI. As an example, Petco used DemandGen campaigns across targeting, creative generation, and bidding to find new pet parent audiences across YouTube. They achieved a 275% higher return on ad spend and a 74% higher click-through rate than their social benchmarks. On media buying, we made YouTube select creator takeovers generally available in the U.S. and will be expanding to more markets this year. Creators know their audience the best and creator takeovers help businesses connect with consumers through authentic and relevant content. Looking at Creative, we introduced new controls and made reporting easier in PMAX, helping customers better understand and reinvest into their best performing assets. Using asset generation in PMAX, Event Ticket Center achieved a fivefold increase in production of creative assets, saving time and effort. They also increased convergence by 300% compared to the previous period when they used manual assets. And finally, Measurement. Last week, we made Meridian, our marketing mix model, generally available for customers, helping more businesses reinvest into creative and media buying strategies that they know work. Based on a Nielsen meta-analysis of marketing mix models, on average, Google AI-powered video campaigns on YouTube deliver 17% higher return on advertising spend than manual campaigns. Turning to YouTube. We saw robust revenue growth backed by continued growth and watch time across ad-supported and premium experiences. Our focus here remains on building a streaming platform that enables creators to thrive and unlock the full potential of AI. Expanding on our state-of-the-art video generation model, we announced Veo 2, which creates incredibly high-quality video in a wide range of subjects and styles. It's been inspiring to see how people are experimenting with it. We'll make it available to creators on YouTube in the coming months. We continue to invest in helping YouTube creators work with brands. All advertisers globally can now promote YouTube creator videos and ad campaigns across all AI-powered campaign types in Google Ads. And creators can tag partners in their brand videos. Sephora used DemandGen's Shorts-Only channel to boost traffic and brand searches for the Holiday Gift Guide campaign and leverage creator collaborations to find the best gift. This drove an 82% relative uplift in searches for Sephora Holiday. Shorts continues its ascent and is closing the gap with long form. In 2024, the monetization rate of Shorts relative to in-stream viewing increased by more than 30 percentage points in the U.S., and we expect to make additional progress in 2025. We're making it easier for advertisers to benefit from Shorts on all screens. We're particularly excited by its success on connected TV, which now makes up 15% of shorts viewing in the U.S. Using a combination of ad formats, Louis Vuitton reached their overall objectives on both long-form and short-form content. Their shorts exceeded luxury goods benchmark for average view duration by 89% for equivalent video lengths, while their long-form content exceeded the benchmark by over 15%, with strong engagement from Gen Z and Millennials. Looking into the living room, we continue to be number one in streaming watch time in the U.S. for nearly two years, according to Nielsen, and our share of streaming is at a record high. Viewers globally streamed over 1 billion hours of YouTube content daily on their TVs in 2024. YouTube makes multi-year investments to tap into shifting consumer behavior. The current surge in living room viewership directly reflects years of work to build the right products and partnerships. Creators are now prioritizing high-quality viewing experiences that truly shine on TV screens, inspiring even more viewers to tune in. In fact, the number of creators making the majority of revenue from TV is up over 30% year-on-year. We have also invested in podcasts, where popular shows like Club Shay Shay and Lex Friedman are increasingly a visual format. YouTube creators and viewers are embracing this. In 2024, people watched over 400 million hours of podcasts each month on living room devices alone. YouTube is now the most popular service for podcast listening in the U.S., according to Edison. As always, let me wrap with the strong momentum we're seeing in partnerships, where the breadth of what Google has to offer is increasingly being recognized. Sundar mentioned our deepening partnership with Samsung. Another expanding partnership is with Citi, who is modernizing its technology infrastructure with Google Cloud to transform employee and customer experiences. Using Google Cloud, it will improve its digital products, streamline employee workflows, and use advanced high-performance computing to enable millions of daily computations. This partnership also fuels Citi's generative AI initiatives across customer service, document summarization, and search to reduce manual processing. With that, allow me a moment to thank Googlers everywhere for their extraordinary commitment and to our customers and partners for their continued trust.",

          "content": "Thank you, Philipp. We're pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing across the business as Alphabet revenue for 2024 reached $350 billion, up 14% on a reported basis and 15% in constant currency versus 2023. My comments will focus on year-over-year comparisons for the fourth quarter, unless I state otherwise. I will start with the results at the Alphabet level and we'll then cover our segment results. I'll end with some commentary and expectations over the first quarter and full year 2025. We had another strong quarter in Q4 with robust momentum across the business. Consolidated revenue of $96.5 billion increased by 12% in both reported and constant currency. Search remained the largest contributor to revenue growth, followed by Cloud. Total cost of revenue was $40.6 billion, up 8%. Tech was $14.8 billion, up 6%. We continue to see a revenue mix shift with Google Search growing at double-digit levels, while network revenues, which have a much higher tech rate, declined. Other costs of revenue was $25.8 billion, up 9%, with the increase primarily driven by content acquisition costs, primarily for YouTube, followed by depreciation, due to increasing investments in our technical infrastructure. Growth in content acquisition and depreciation were partially offset by our year-over-year decline in hardware costs due to the shift in timing of our made-by-Google launches to the third quarter 2024 compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. In terms of total expenses, the year-over-year comparisons reflect $1.2 billion in exit charges that we took in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with actions to optimize our global office space. As previously disclosed, those charges were allocated across the expense lines in other costs of revenue and OpEx based on associated headcount. Total operating expenses decreased 1% to $24.9 billion. R&D investments increased by 8%, primarily driven by increase in compensation and depreciation expenses, partially offset by the impact of charges for office space optimization in the fourth quarter of 2023. Sales and marketing expenses decreased 5%, primarily reflecting the optimization charges last year, as well as declines in compensation and in ads and promotion expenses due to the timing shift of the Pixel launch from Q4 to Q3. G&A expenses declined by 15%, reflecting a shift of timing in our charitable contributions, as well as the optimization charges last year. Operating income increased 31%, to $31 billion, and operating margin increased to 32%, representing 4.6 points of margin expansion. Net income increased 28% to $26.5 billion, and earnings per share increased 31% to $2.15. We delivered free cash flow of $24.8 billion in the fourth quarter and $72.8 billion for the full year 2024. We ended the quarter with $96 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to segment results. Google Service revenues increased 10% to $84.1 billion, reflecting the strong momentum across Google Search and YouTube ads. Google Search and other advertising revenues increased by 13% to $54 billion. The robust performance of Search was once again broad-based across verticals, led by the financial service vertical due to strength in insurance, followed by retail. YouTube advertising revenue increased 14% to $10.5 billion, driven by brand, followed by direct response advertising. Network advertising revenue of $8 billion were down 4%. In the fourth quarter, the year-over-year comparison in all of our advertising revenue lines was impacted by the increase in strength in advertising revenue in Q4 2023, in part from APAC-based retailers. Subscription platforms and device revenues increased 8% to $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting growth in subscription revenues, partially offset by the shift in timing of the launch of our made by Google devices to the third quarter, compared with the fourth quarter in 2023. We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, primarily due to increase in the number of paid subscribers across YouTube TV, YouTube Music Premium, and Google One. With regards to Platform, we saw a slight increase in the growth rate in Play, primarily due to a strong increase in the number of buyers. Google's service operating income increased 23% to $32.8 billion, and operating margin increased from 35% to 39%, representing a meaningful margin expansion. Turning to the Google Cloud segment, which continued to deliver very strong results this quarter. Revenue increased by 30% to $12 billion in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in GCP across core GCP products, AI infrastructure, and generative AI solutions. Once again, GCP grew at a rate that was much higher than cloud overall. Healthy Google Workspace growth was primarily driven by an increase in average revenue per seat. Google Cloud operating income increased to $2.1 billion, and operating margin increased from 9.4% to 17.5%. We're pleased with the work the cloud team is doing to deliver valuable solutions to the customer and generate revenue growth, as well as its continued focus on driving efficiencies across the cloud business. As for Other Bets, for the fourth quarter, revenues were $400 million, and the operating loss was $1.2 billion. The year-over-year decline in revenue and increase in operating loss primarily reflect the milestone payment in the fourth quarter of 2023 for one of the Other Bets. Turning to Alphabet level activities, the largest component of this line is our investments in AI research and development activities which support all of Alphabet. As a reminder, Alphabet level activities have included nearly all severance charges from reductions in the workforce and office space charges. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the biggest factor in year-over-year comparison is the $1.2 billion in charges in the fourth quarter of 2023, almost entirely in connection with office space optimization. With respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the fourth quarter was $14 billion, primarily reflecting investments in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component being investment in servers, followed by data centers, to support the growth of our business across Google Services, Google Cloud, and Google DeepMind. In Q4, we returned value to shareholders in the form of $15 billion in share purchases and $2.4 billion in dividend payments. Overall, we returned a total of nearly $70 billion to shareholders in 2024. Turning to 2025, I would like to provide some commentary on several factors that will impact our business performance in both the first quarter and the full year 2025. First in terms of revenue, I'll highlight two items that will have a meaningful impact on Q1 revenue across the company. The first is the impact of foreign exchange rates. At the current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind to our revenues from the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to key currencies in Q1 versus Q4 2024. Second is the impact of leap year. We expect a headwind from having one less day of revenue in Q1 2025 compared with leap year in the first quarter of 2024. As for our segments, Google Services, advertising revenue in 2025 will be impacted by lapping the strength we experience in the financial service vertical throughout 2024. And in Cloud, given the revenues are correlated with the timing of the deployment of new capacity, we could see variability in cloud revenue growth rates depending on when new capacity comes online during 2025. Moving to investments, starting with our expectation for CapEx for the full year 2025. As we mentioned on the Q3 call, as we expand our AI efforts, we expect to increase our investments in capital expenditure for technical infrastructure, primarily for servers, followed by data centers and networking. We expect to invest approximately $75 billion in CapEx in 2025 with approximately $16 billion to $18 billion of that in the first quarter. The expected total investment level may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, primarily due to the timing of deliveries and construction schedules. In terms of expenses, first, the increase in our investment in CapEx over the past few years will increase pressure on the P&L, primarily in the form of higher depreciation. In 2024, we saw 28% year-over-year growth in depreciation as we put more technical infrastructure assets into service. Given the increase in CapEx investments over the past few years, we expect the growth rate and depreciation to accelerate in 2025. Second, we expect some headcount growth in 2025 in key investment areas such as AI and cloud. As you just heard from Sundar, we're delivering products and solutions to customers at a rapid pace, building, testing, and launching products faster than ever before. And as I mentioned on the Q3 call, we're doing that while also focusing on driving further efficiencies in how we operate the business. Before we take questions, I'd like to recap the financial results for the year. For the full year 2024, revenue grew by 14% or by $43 billion, reaching $350 billion. Google Services and Google Cloud each continue to see double-digit revenue growth coupled with margin extension. YouTube and cloud revenues combined, ended the year at $110 billion annual run rate. And in 2024, we generated a total income of $112 billion, an increase of 33% from 2023. We're pleased with the momentum we're seeing in AI innovation and monetization. We've been using AI to improve the performance of our ads business for well over a decade, and Cloud is generating billions in annual revenue from AI infrastructure and generative AI solutions. We're also excited about the potential to bring new experiences to users that will provide additional opportunities for monetization. And I look forward to sharing more in our progress throughout the year. Sundar, Philipp, and I will now take your questions.",

But there's a lot more to come. I think we'll continue bringing AI in more powerful ways, in multi-modal ways. Things like what we've done with Lens Circle to Search, you can imagine the future with Project Astra. You can also imagine areas like we have done in Gemini Deep Research, possibilities where you are really dramatically expanding the types of use cases for which Search can work, things which don't always get answered instantaneously but can take some time to answer. Those are all areas of exploration and you will see us putting newer experiences in front of users through the course of 2025.

It's crucial that we do this as efficiently as possible. Managing headcount growth is also essential; while we will invest in growth sectors like AI and cloud, it's important to moderate growth across the organization. We are focused on optimizing our real estate footprint and simplifying the organization by integrating similar functions. This includes uniting some AI research teams to enhance our operational speed and utilizing our AI tools to improve business processes, such as code writing and managing key operations.

Sundar, with the news that came out of China a little over 2 weeks ago, I think investors have been asking a lot of questions about the long-term cost curve for AI as AI moves from the infrastructure layer to the application layer or from training to inference and maybe even custom silicon becomes more dominant across the theme.

Look, I think for us it's always been obvious, over time, there's frontier model development, but you can drive a lot of efficiency to serve these models really, really well. And if you look at one of the areas in which the Gemini model shines is the Pareto frontier of cost, performance, and latency and if you look at all three attributes, I think we lead this Pareto frontier. And I would say both our 2.0 flash models or 2.0 flash thinking models. They are some of the most efficient models out there, including comparing to DeepSeek's V3 and R1. And I think a lot of it is our strength of the full stack development into an optimization, our obsession with cost per query, all of that, I think, sets us up well for the workloads ahead, both to serve billions of users across our products and on the cloud side. Couple of things I would say are, if you look at the trajectory over the past three years, the proportion of the spend towards inference compared to training has been increasing, which is good because obviously inference is to support businesses with good ROIC. And so I think that trend is good. I think the reasoning models, if anything, accelerates that trend because it's obviously scaling upon inference dimension as well. And so I think, look, I think part of the reason we are so excited about the AI opportunity is we know we can drive extraordinary use cases because the cost of actually using it is going to keep coming down which will make more use cases feasible. And that's the opportunity space. It's as big as it comes. And that's why you're seeing us invest to meet that moment.",

And then I guess the $75 billion question Anat is, how do you think about long-term capital intensity for this business?

And in Q4, we actually introduced quite a transformed Google Shopping experience, which we rebuilt from the ground up with AI. And people shop more than a billion times a day across Google. Last quarter, we introduced this fully reinvented Google Shopping experience. In December, we saw roughly, as I mentioned, 13% more daily active users on Google Shopping in the U.S. compared to the same period last year. So that's a good development here. And the new Google Shopping experiences, specifically to your question, uses AI to really intelligently show the most relevant products, helping to speed up and simplify your research. You get an AI-generated brief with top things to consider for your search, plus maybe products that meet your needs. So shoppers very often want low prices. So the new page not only includes deal finding tools like price comparison, price insights, price tracking throughout, but there's also a new and dedicated personalized deals page where you can browse deals for you, and all this is really built on the backbone of AI.

And as you've seen in the comment I've just made on cloud, we do have demand that exceeds our available capacity, so we'll be working hard to address that and make sure we bring more capacity online. We do have the benefit of having a very broad business, and we can repurpose capacity, whether it's through Google Services or Google Cloud to support, as I said, whether it's Search or GDM or Google Cloud Customers, we can do that in a more efficient manner. We also look at every investment that we make to ensure that we're doing it in the most cost-efficient way to optimize our data center. As you know, our strategy is mostly to rely on our own self-design and build data centers. So they're industry-leading in terms of both cost and power efficiency at scale. We have our customized TPUs. They're customized for our own workload. So, they do deliver outstanding superior performance and CapEx efficiency.

It's always been our vision when we have talked about Google Assistant, et cetera. So I think the opportunity space expands. I think there's plenty of, it feels very far from a zero-sum game. There's plenty of room, I think, for many new types of use cases to flourish. And I think for us, we have a clear sense of additional use cases we can start to tackle for our users in Google Search.

Do you see this as an advantage as everything shifts to inference? And then Anat, you call out lapping the financial services category strength in 2025 as a bit of a problem for Search.

We have the Pareto frontier we mentioned, and I think our full-stack approach and our TPU efforts all give a meaningful advantage, and we plan, you already see that. I know you asked about the cost, but it's effectively captured. When we price outside, we pass on the differentiation. It's partly why we've been able to bring forward flash models at very attractive value props, which is what is driving both developer growth.

I am not going to give any specific numbers as to what we expect to see in 2025, but I am pleased with the fact that we are seeing and continue to see strength across really all verticals including retail, and exiting the year in a position of strength.

So definitely driving organic growth by putting the product out. We just last week rolled out with our 2.0 series of models. So 2.0 Flash, I mean, I think that's one of the most capable models you can access at the free tier. So that's definitely contributing as well. And so we are rapidly trading. We've had a couple of key innovations there. Gemini Live, I think, has been definitely a hit with users, as well as for advanced users, Gemini Deep Research. So I think a combination of innovation, continually trading on the product and making it better, is driving a lot of usage. And we'll have a lot more to come as we go this year. And we obviously have a partnership with Samsung, so there are other things which will contribute to it as well. On the monetization side, obviously for now we are focused on a free tier and subscriptions, but obviously as you've seen in Google over time, we always want to lead with user experience.

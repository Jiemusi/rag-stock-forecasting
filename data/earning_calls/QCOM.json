          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Based on our performance over the past several quarters and the strong fiscal second quarter guidance, it is clear that our strategy is working. Demand for our products and solutions continues to accelerate, as our one technology roadmap is driving the growth of premium Android smartphones, as well as enabling the connected intelligent edge, which is driving digital transformation for the cloud-connected economy. As you can see from our results today, strong performance in our chipset and licensing business led to record fiscal first quarter revenues of $10.7 billion and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.23. Our chipset business had its second consecutive quarter of record performance with revenues of $8.8 billion, EBT of $3.1 billion and EBT margin of 35%. Notably, QCT revenues exceeded those of any fabless semiconductor company. These results demonstrate the continued success of our diversification strategy. In IoT, we continue to see strong momentum, with revenue growth of 41% year-over-year in the first quarter across consumer, edge networking and industrial. In consumer IoT, our early investments, collaboration with Microsoft and the recent acquisition of NUVIA, uniquely position us to drive the PC industry transition to ARM-based computing for next-generation connected laptops. We recently introduced two new platforms, the 8cx Gen 3 and 7c+ Gen 3. And at CES, we highlighted broad support from ecosystem partners, including Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo and Microsoft as well as 200 enterprise customers currently testing or deploying Windows on Snapdragon laptops in 2-in-1 devices. We're also seeing strong growth in premium and high-tier Android tablets, further highlighting the convergence of mobile and PC. Notably, we have already doubled the total number of premium tier and/or tablet design wins launched or in the pipeline versus all of fiscal '21. Additionally, as the Metaverse opportunity materializes, we continue to build on our industry leadership position in VR and AR devices with key ecosystem players, including Meta and Microsoft. At CES, we announced a collaboration with Microsoft to expand and accelerate the adoption of augmented reality in both the consumer and enterprise sectors. This partnership includes custom AR chips to enable a new wave of power-efficient, lightweight AR glasses to deliver rich and immersive experiences as well as plans to integrate our Snapdragon Spaces XR developer platform into Microsoft mesh. We're also very pleased that Time Magazine named our Snapdragon XR2 platform as one of the best inventions of 2021. And we're seeing strong support for our VR and AR platforms from virtually all ecosystem providers, OEMs and content creators. In edge networking, we continue to lead in current and next-generation high-performance Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E solutions, which now make up more than 80% of our Wi-Fi access point revenues. Recently, we launched the world's first quad-band Wi-Fi 6E mesh system with NETGEAR, which was rated the best-in-class mesh platform by PC Magazine. Additionally, our Wi-Fi 6 immersive home platforms continue to gain momentum across regions, with significant growth now expanding into China, one of the fastest-growing markets for Wi-Fi 6 for both retail and carrier deployments. 5G as wireless fiber continues to gain scale and expand globally. In addition to our extended range millimeter wave platforms, we recently expanded our portfolio to include 5G fixed wireless access solutions with extended range sub-6, and we're seeing strong traction. In industrial, we're still in the early phases of digital transformation across many industries. And demand for our solutions continues to accelerate. As an example, combined smart utility meter, tracking robotics and retail revenues more than double over the last year. In robotics, specifically, we expect total fiscal '22 product launches using our platforms to increase by over 50% year-over-year, spanning applications from warehouse automation to public safety, delivery services and in-home assistance. The diversity of vertical segments and applications reflects our ability to provide a common platform that integrates advanced computer vision, on-device AI, high performance in low-power computing and industry-leading connectivity technologies. In RF front end, we successfully launched our latest 5G modules, which now include our ultraBAW technology. Our modem-to-antenna strategy is working, enhancing power and performance with average generation of Snapdragon. Notably, virtually all our Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 design wins now include Qualcomm ultraBAW filter technology. Building on our success in handsets, we're seeing traction with our modem-to-antenna solution across automotive and IoT. As examples, we're well positioned to address up to $30 of 5G RF content per vehicle, and we're also intersecting our RF front end roadmap with Wi-Fi 7. In automotive, Qualcomm is becoming the technology partner of choice for the industry, and we're enabling the transition of the automobile to a digital cloud-connected platform. Our innovative Snapdragon digital chassis is an open and scalable cloud-enabled platform for telematics, connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS, and uniquely positions us as the leading system solution provider for silicon, software, systems and services across multiple domains. As a reminder, General Motors, BMW and now Renault Group are cornerstone customers for our platform, including ADAS. At CES, we announced an addition to our ADAS and autonomy platform, the Snapdragon Ride Vision System, a new modular computer vision solution that combines our Snapdragon Ride SoCs with the next-generation vision perception software from Arriver. It supports the various compute functions needed for enhanced perception around the vehicle, and it scales across applications from entry-tier in-cap front camera to comprehensive front and surround view camera for enhanced autonomy. We expect the Snapdragon Ride Vision System to be available in production in 2024. In handsets, we recently announced our most advanced 5G mobile platform for flagship smartphones, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 at our annual Snapdragon Tech Summit. The announcement was viewed by more than 50 million people worldwide. The new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 leads the way to a new era of premium mobile technology with category-defining enhancements across modern RF, camera, AI, gaming, security and more. Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the world's first 5G modem RF solution to reach 10 gigabit download speeds. It's the first to include a commercial 18-bit mobile image sensor and the world's first platform compliant with the Android-ready Secure Element Alliance. We also announced new mobile platforms in every Snapdragon series to address global customer demand across every smartphone tier. In our licensing business, first quarter results reflect a favorable mix in the strength of smartphone shipments. With over 150 5G license agreements, QTL is well positioned for the future, and we continue to expect 5G to have a longer life cycle than prior generations due to its broad application across multiple industries. Lastly, demand remains strong across all of our technologies and continues to exceed supply. Despite ongoing challenges across the global supply chain, our multisourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will provide incremental improvements to our supply throughout the year.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano and good afternoon everyone. We are extremely pleased to report strong results to start our fiscal year. We delivered our second consecutive quarter of record non-GAAP earnings, with revenues of $10.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.23. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 30% and 49%, respectively, driven by strength across both QCT and QTL. For QCT, this was another record quarter with revenues of $8.8 billion and EBT of $3.1 billion, up 35% and 62%, respectively versus the year-ago quarter. QCT EBT margins of 35% surpassed the end of our guidance range and increased six points versus the year-ago quarter driven by revenue scale and operating leverage. Handset revenues of $6 billion increased 42% year-over-year due to greater than 60% growth in revenues from Snapdragon chipsets for Android devices. RF front-end revenues of $1.1 billion grew 7% versus the year-ago quarter, reflecting the previously mentioned pull-in of demand into the fourth fiscal quarter. Our RF front-end revenues for Android devices grew by greater than 25% versus the year-ago quarter as we continued to see strong traction across all major OEMs. IoT revenues were up 41% year-over-year to $1.5 billion on continued demand for our cloud connected intelligent edge devices. Each of the consumer, edge networking, and industrial categories grew by at least 30% compared to the year-ago quarter. Automotive revenues of $256 million grew 21% year-over-year on the strength of our design wins across our Snapdragon digital chassis. We recorded QTL revenues of $1.8 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, and EBT margins of 77%, which was above the midpoint of the guidance. These results reflect a favorable mix and slightly higher handset shipments. Turning to global handsets and our guidance for the second fiscal quarter. For calendar 2021, consistent with the previous guidance, we estimate global 3G, 4G, 5G handsets grew 7% year-over-year, including approximately 535 million 5G handsets. For calendar 2022, there is no change to the forecast provided at our Investor Day with greater than 750 million 5G handsets. For the second fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $10.2 billion to $11 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.80 to $3. In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.7 billion to $9.3 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 43% and EBT dollar growth of $1.4 billion. For handsets and RF front end, we expect revenues to be in line sequentially as seasonal decline in Apple revenues is offset by continued growth in revenues from Android devices. Within handsets, the increase in Android revenue is driven by the launch of our new Snapdragon premium chipset and additional shipments across high and mid-tiers due to our second sourcing efforts. Additionally, we expect strong year-over-year and sequential growth in our IoT and automotive revenue streams. We estimate QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 70% to 74%. This reflects the normal pre-COVID trends following the strong holiday quarter. We anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 7% to 9% sequentially on normal seasonality, including calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. The remaining increase reflects select investments in long-term growth initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day. Looking forward to the third fiscal quarter, we are forecasting year-over-year non-GAAP EPS growth of greater than 30%. For QCT, this reflects the seasonality following Chinese New Year purchases and the launch of our new Snapdragon premium chipset in the second quarter. We expect the next inflection point in QCT to be in the second half of the calendar year, with the launch of new 5G handsets across several major OEMs. Lastly, we published our annual corporate responsibility and ESG report yesterday, which outlines progress against our company-wide targets, including environmental sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and power efficiency of our Snapdragon products. We are pleased to have been recognized by several organizations, including making the Dow Jones Sustainability Index and Newsweek's most responsible company list for the third consecutive year.

As you rightly mentioned, we had put plans in place very early in the process, anticipating some of these challenges. And you're seeing the benefit of that, right? We have three second sourcing parts, especially in the mid high tiers that are shipping at scale now, and that shows up in our financial performance. And we have additional parts coming up as well. So that's definitely something that's helping us. The second is we're seeing capacity builds from some of our suppliers, and that's playing a role as well. As you look forward, we expect supply to continue to improve gradually through the year, in addition to where we are at now.

Moving into the September quarter, we expect a notable growth surge due to new phone launches from several major OEMs, leading to strong year-over-year growth. Additionally, outside of handsets, we foresee continued robust growth in RF front end, IoT, and automotive sectors in the second half of fiscal 2022.

We've been discussing our technology roadmap that scales well, and you can see this in our diversification strategy as we generate more revenue from non-handset business. This expansion allows us to achieve economies of scale, enhances our margins, and I believe this is evident in our numbers. I expect this trend to continue as we leverage our roadmap. Now, regarding your question about competition, we are pleased with our current position. I shared a metric that we usually don't disclose in my prepared remarks. When we launched the new Snapdragon 8 series, we received 50 million views for the launch event, which took place simultaneously in the United States and two locations in China. Snapdragon is becoming the preferred brand for premium-tier Android devices. Our customers no longer envision flagship products without considering the Snapdragon 8 series, which puts us in a very strong position. As our customers move toward the premium tier, we are seeing an increase in our market share. That's why the Android segment is central to our handset business right now. Furthermore, with the shift in OEM share in China, we have numerous opportunities for growth, alongside our competitors. I anticipate that we\u2019ll continue to achieve positive results, and increasingly, our customers will rely on the Snapdragon brand.",

While demand remains strong, we are in a fortunate position. In the handset business, we saw a significant growth rate for Android, with 60% growth in the quarter. As we mentioned in previous quarters, we are prioritizing supply for the Chinese New Year launches. We will continue to see more demand than supply in all of our growth businesses. As we move into the next quarter, you'll see growth in the business and potential growth in non-handset categories. The next key moment for handsets will be during the holiday season in our September quarter. We expect improvements in supply throughout the year, allowing us to sustain growth across all business areas. We're pleased with the way the year is progressing, and our supply situation is reflected in our forward guidance. That said, demand continues to rise, which is a positive development.",

But if I sort of stare at it, I think they probably were up a couple of hundred basis points. And I find that interesting just given the relative strength of handsets versus the adjacencies, which I think do have higher margins. Was that just the Android strength that you talked about that drove that margin in the quarter? And then how should we think about that into March as sort of the mix reverses? But you should have some of the higher margins of the adjacencies actually growing sequentially into March. I mean is there room for more margin expansion as we go into the next quarter?",

The second part of the answer relates to our technology roadmap, which is designed for scalability. By utilizing our technology in research and development to serve more markets, we have achieved greater scale with our application processor in premium Android devices, making Android the central narrative in mobile, rather than the modem. The Snapdragon 800 is a significant aspect of this. Additionally, we are also advancing in processing and connectivity for automotive and IoT markets, which enhances margins. The growth in this business allows us to achieve scale, and these offerings are highly profitable. Both of these factors contribute to the QCT's operating margin of 35%.",

Cristiano, much of the discussion here has centered on the supply and demand for your products, including the wafers and other components necessary for manufacturing. However, in many of our conversations in the semiconductor industry, we're hearing about matching and kitting challenges that your customers face when producing devices. Recently, I've noticed an increasing emphasis on Qualcomm potentially leveraging its scale to aid OEM customers in sourcing the remaining components needed to manufacture phones. This could lead to a stronger alignment with reference designs, which would allow you to have greater control over the components involved. I am curious if you see your scale as a competitive advantage and whether this has any implications for the attach rates of RF and other components that could generate additional revenue for Qualcomm in those designs. Thank you.",

For instance, when we discuss the Snapdragon 8 Series Generation 1, we see it as a leading node system-on-chip, and it has many attached components. The transceiver includes a complete front-end attachment and power management IC. Ultimately, when we deliver a chipset solution to our customers, we require capacity across various nodes. As we consider multi-sourcing our products and implementing capacity expansion plans, we ensure that we have enough supply to support both our handset business and growth segments. We've been increasing capacity across different technologies, and for components like power management ICs and transceivers, we collaborate with four or five foundries. The semiconductor supply chain shortage affects all aspects of the industry. On the positive side, our scale has been very beneficial. Two key factors for Qualcomm are the high predictability of our demand, which allows us to make long-term capacity plans and secure commitments from our vendors, and our ability to leverage multi-sourcing. This positions us well to navigate challenges in the supply chain. That said, I want to reiterate that we still experience more demand than supply, even with our satisfaction regarding growth rates, quarterly performance, and management. We recognize the seasonal variations between handsets and growth segments. However, we anticipate improvements in supply as we progress into the second half of 2022.",

It's separate us from everybody else. So it's not about having a component. It's about creating a digital chassis with capabilities in all domains, from connecting the car to the cloud, telematics, the entire immersive digital cockpit experience and, of course, ADAS and autonomy, plus a service platform. GM is, as we said, a cornerstone customer that is not only looking into the capability of ADAS, and we're super proud of the work with them, on both the Super Cruise and Ultra Cruise, but also the ability to look at the entire chassis. BMW was another one, which we announced towards our Analyst Day. At CES, we announced Renault as an addition to the digital chassis. You should expect that we have a lot of other irons in the fire. Overall, automotive is a good story for Qualcomm. It's something that we can actually take a platform approach and take some of the things we have done in mobile, it's take the technology to scale up and down to every tier of automobile.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. As we shared at our Investor Day last November, Qualcomm is at the intersection of transformative trends that are generating demand for our broad technology portfolio across virtually every industry. This is creating strong growth and diversification opportunities beyond handsets. These trends, which include the enterprise transformation of the home, convergence of mobile and PC, merging of physical and digital spaces, the digital transformation of industries, connectivity and processing at the edge, the automotive digital chassis, and 5G have only continued to accelerate. They are driving our financial outperformance in a greater-than-7x addressable market expansion to approximately $700 billion in the next decade. As you can see from our results, we delivered record revenues of $11.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $3.21 per share, representing year-over-year growth of 41% and 69%, respectively, both exceeding the high end of our guidance. In QCT, our chipset business and the growth engine of the company, we saw strength across the entire portfolio. Revenues of $9.5 billion were also a record and reflect our continued diversification. Our automotive design win pipeline is now over $16 billion, up more than $3 billion since fiscal Q1. IoT revenues grew 61% year-over-year with strong growth across all three categories of consumer, edge networking, and industrial. RF front-end revenues grew 28% year-over-year, and handset revenues grew 56% year-over-year. These results demonstrate that our growth drivers remain unchanged and our strategy is working. Our one technology roadmap across wireless connectivity, advanced edge processing, and power-efficient AI is incomparable across our peer group. In fact, advanced processing and artificial intelligence are the fastest-growing silicon content areas for Qualcomm. As such, we can no longer be defined just as a communications company serving one industry; rather, Qualcomm is a leading connected processor company for the intelligent edge serving multiple new end markets and enabling the growth of the cloud-connected economy. As we continue to expand, we remain on track to meet our Investor Day financial projections, and I will now provide an update on our progress to date. In automotive, our horizontal platform, the Snapdragon digital chassis, is a significant driver of our growing design win pipeline and is increasingly becoming a key asset for automakers. Our digital chassis comprises a full suite of open, flexible, and scalable platforms for telematics, connectivity, digital cockpit, ADAS, autonomy, and cloud services. With leading system solutions expertise and capabilities across multiple domains, Qualcomm is fast becoming the preferred industry partner for the auto industry and is well-positioned for continued growth. Since our last earnings call, we significantly expanded our Snapdragon digital chassis capabilities. First, the Arriver acquisition enhanced our ability to deliver open, fully integrated, and competitive ADAS solutions to automakers and Tier 1 suppliers at scale. As a result of the acquisition, we are incorporating Arriver's computer vision, drive policy, and driver assistance assets into Snapdragon Ride. Second, we recently announced a long-term cooperation with BMW to jointly develop and extend BMW automated drive software to the Snapdragon Ride platform. The co-developed solution is scalable and customizable and can be offered by Qualcomm to other automotive OEMs across all tiers. We are also pleased with our multiyear technology collaboration with Stellantis, which will be utilizing our Snapdragon automotive cockpit platforms across the automaker's 14 brands. Upcoming Stellantis vehicles will also be featuring 5G capabilities for telematics systems based on our Snapdragon auto 5G modem RF platforms. In consumer IoT, Android tablets are becoming collaboration tools, and increasingly demand is shifting from entry-level commodity tablets to premium connected computing devices, a clear validation of the convergence of mobile and PC. We are pleased that Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is powering the newest flagship tablets such as the Galaxy Tab S8 series globally. Additionally, we are growing in premium and high-tier devices with OEMs such as Lenovo, HP, and Opel. We're also pleased to see the announcement of the first-ever premium Windows on ARM enterprise-focused laptop, the Lenovo ThinkPad X13S powered by the new Snapdragon 8CX Gen 3 compute platform. This new ThinkPad features 5G millimeter wave AI-accelerated experiences, advanced camera and audio technology, an ultra-slim, fanless design, and up to 28 hours of battery life on a single charge. We're encouraged by the broad interest in our upcoming products, utilizing our industry-leading CPUs designed by our NUVIA team. We continue to drive the inevitable transition to ARM-based computing while redefining the future of mobile productivity. In edge networking, we continue to benefit from the demand for global connectivity required for remote work, school, and play, and we provide industry-leading solutions, enabling the migration to WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E mesh technologies. We also recently announced the world's first and fastest WiFi 7 commercial solution, which we believe will further extend our leadership position. With multi-gigabit WiFi performance, ultra-low latency, and unmatched spectrum versatility, we believe our WiFi 7 solutions will unlock a new era of advanced consumer and industrial applications. Our 5G fixed wireless access solutions also continue to gain traction as a last-mile broadband solution. We now have more than 125 fixed wireless access designs announced or in development by more than 40 OEMs. We also introduced next-generation features such as standalone 5G millimeter wave support in our RF sensing suite to enable operators to extend their 5G service offerings to the home and enterprise. Industrial IoT experienced the fastest year-over-year revenue growth within IoT this quarter driven by continued demand for both connectivity and advanced processing at the edge. Notably, this quarter, we saw accelerated demand for ruggedized handheld devices for warehousing, logistics, and healthcare industries as well as for robotics platforms. Going forward, we're actively building an ecosystem of system integrators and channel partners to support the scale of our industrial IoT platforms as they become critical for the digital transformation of multiple verticals. In handsets, we had record revenues of $6.3 billion driven by continued traction with leading smartphone OEMs such as Samsung, Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, and Honor, where Snapdragon continues to be the mobile technology platform of choice for premium and high-tier Android. We now have approximately 75% of the premium tier processor volume for Samsung's Galaxy S22 smartphones, up from approximately 40% in the Galaxy S21. Samsung's strategy to adopt Qualcomm for the majority of volume is significant and validates our platform leadership as well as consumer preference for the Snapdragon brand. Our Snapdragon mobile solutions continue to define premium smartphone experiences. Let me highlight a few examples from our Snapdragon 8 Gen 1. In imaging, devices enabled by this platform achieved the highest DxOMark ever, making it the best smartphone camera in the world. In connectivity, our solution features the world's first 5G AI processor in a modem RF system, enabling AI-based performance enhancements, antenna tuning, network selection, and more. In AI, our 7th generation AI engine doubles the computational performance versus the previous generation. Our handset strategy, as outlined at Investor Day, is enabling share gains and enhancing our ability to capture the most significant portion of the revenue opportunity. In RF front end, we continue to drive 5G modem RF leadership. Our fifth-generation modem RF system now implements advanced features such as AI integration, millimeter wave and sub-6 dual connectivity in 5G sub-6 carrier aggregation with FDD and TDD spectrum. Looking forward, in addition to growth in handsets, we're expanding RF front end into automotive and IoT. In our licensing business, revenues of $1.6 billion were above the midpoint of our guidance driven by the most valuable patent portfolio in the industry, and we continue to develop and patent new essential innovations for future releases of 5G and beyond. Lastly, demand remains strong across all our technologies and continues to exceed supply. We believe our multi-sourcing and capacity expansion initiatives will continue to provide incremental improvements towards supply throughout the year. With our One Technology roadmap and demand for our products and solutions across virtually all industries, we are in an incredible position to continue providing high-performance, low-power computing on-device intelligence, and everything wireless. Our plan remains on track, and I'm very excited for the future of Qualcomm. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We're extremely pleased to report strong second quarter results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $11.2 billion, our third consecutive quarter of record revenues and non-GAAP EPS of $3.21. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 41% and 69%, respectively, driven by strength across all QCT revenue streams. QTL revenues of $1.6 billion and EBT margin of 73% were above the midpoint of guidance, reflecting a slight decrease in lower-tier units, offset by a favorable mix. This was another record quarter for QCT with revenues of $9.5 billion and EBT of $3.3 billion, an increase of 52% and 111%, respectively, versus the year ago quarter. We have now doubled QCT EBT dollars on a year-over-year basis in six of the last seven quarters. Additionally, QCT EBT margin of 35% surpassed the high end of our guidance and increased 10 points year-over-year driven by revenue growth and diversification. Handset revenues of $6.3 billion increased 56% versus a year ago quarter. The upside relative to guidance was driven by increased volume in premium tier and improved supply. We gained share in Samsung's flagship device, the Galaxy S22, demonstrating leadership of our Snapdragon processor technology and our ability to compete with internal chipset initiatives. RF front-end revenues of $1.2 billion grew 28% versus the year ago quarter on increased adoption of our products across major OEMs. We saw accelerated growth across IoT and automotive as we align supply to better meet the demand for our products. IoT revenues were up 61% year-over-year to $1.7 billion primarily on increased demand for our chipsets for connected intelligent edge devices. We saw strong performance across consumer, edge networking, and industrial with each of these categories growing by more than 50% compared to the year ago quarter. We achieved record automotive revenues of $339 million, a growth of 41% versus the year ago period, driven by launches with our digital cockpit platforms. With the strong adoption of our Snapdragon digital chassis, we have now increased our overall design win pipeline to greater than $16 billion. Lastly, during the quarter, we announced a 10% increase in our dividends and returned $1.7 billion in dividends and stock repurchases. Our strong free cash flow has positioned us to deliver attractive capital returns that are among the highest in the semiconductor industry while maintaining flexibility for strategic investments. Before turning to guidance, I will provide an update on the Arriver acquisition. On April 1, SSW Partners acquired Veoneer for $4.6 billion with substantially all of it funded by Qualcomm. SSW Partners then transferred Arriver to Qualcomm and now plans to sell the remaining non-Arriver businesses over the next several quarters. We expect that Qualcomm will receive most of the cash proceeds from the sale. We estimate Arriver non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $50 million per quarter. However, our guidance for the third fiscal quarter does not include this impact since we plan to report Arriver one quarter in arrears until the fourth quarter. Further details of the transaction are included in our 10-Q and earnings presentation posted on our Investor Relations website. Turning to financial guidance for the third fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $10.5 billion to $11.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.75 to $2.95. We estimate QTL revenues of $1.4 billion to $1.6 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. Our guidance contemplates global handset units consistent with the exit rate from the second fiscal quarter and assumes the end of COVID-related impact in China by the end of the quarter. In QCT, we estimate revenues of $9.1 billion to $9.6 billion and EBT margins of 31% to 33%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 44% and EBT dollar growth of $1.2 billion. On a sequential basis, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth in IoT and automotive and a seasonal reduction in handsets and RF front end. Our strong forecast for QCT is driven by the same factors which benefited our second quarter, including gains in handset premium tier volume, strong demand in IoT and automotive, and supply improvements. We anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 5% to 7% sequentially, reflecting select investments in product roadmap. In closing, we are pleased with our financial results and strong execution as we manage to supply constraints in the current macroeconomic environment. Our QCT handset revenues are on track to grow by greater than 50% in fiscal '22. And we are well positioned for fiscal '23 as we continue to benefit from increased processor content and share gains. While we strengthen our mobile leadership, diversification is the top priority for the company as evidenced by increasing design win pipeline in automotive and accelerating revenue growth in IoT. Thank you. Back to you, Mauricio.",

I wonder if we could go back and revisit some assumptions from the Analyst Day. I think you guys had talked about getting to $3.5 billion in revenue on sort of a 5-year basis. You're running maybe 1/3 of that now, but the pipeline has expanded dramatically. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the visibility on revenue and how you're thinking about the numbers that you laid out at the Analyst Day for that strong automotive growth.",

If we reflect on the Analyst Day, there was a discussion about achieving a 12% growth in QCT handset revenue, even as Cupertino lost share in the 2023 phone market considerably. At that time, there were questions about whether it would be possible to grow Android revenue meaningfully over the next two to three years.

Instead of providing a modem, we provide an entire Snapdragon platform with AI, GPUs, CPUs, and a lot of silicon content plus RF front end. It's a pretty positive trade, if I can say it that way. This has been consistent with what we said before. You probably saw that in the making as a lot of the new form factor from Samsung, both the fold and the flip was Qualcomm globally. And I think the Galaxy S22 kind of outlined the strategy of a deeper partnership with Qualcomm. And going forward, we expect our relationship with Samsung only to increase. So we're very pleased, and I think it reflects that the strategy is working. We've been focused on premium and high, and that's the value share of the Android market, and technology investments, our differentiation, and even Snapdragon brand matters.

As Akash mentioned, we are seeing a year-over-year growth of about 50% for fiscal '22, with a 56% increase in the last quarter. This is due to gaining market share not only with Samsung but also in China when comparing fiscal '22 to fiscal 2021. Additionally, we view Snapdragon as synonymous with premium high-end Android devices. Our design pipeline is robust, and we've shared updates on the number of designs. I'll let Akash elaborate on the market. Even though the overall market seems a bit softer, we are not heavily impacted by lower-tier units thanks to our focus on premium offerings and market value.

Firstly, the increase in our Samsung share has contributed positively at the premium tier. Secondly, supply improvements have allowed us to satisfy more demand in China. We've also noted that as the OEM mix shifts, it has opened up more market opportunities for us. It's important to keep in mind that only 20% of global handset units come from China, which means there is still strong demand in the premium high tier market where we can participate. Additionally, from a content perspective, consumer demands keep increasing with each generation of phones, providing us with opportunities for competitive differentiation and more content per device. For instance, comparing one generation of 5G phones to the next, the enhanced content on the processor side is positively impacting our results.",

We're really focused on premium and high tier. We have been very disciplined in how we think about pricing. And we're really building on our technology differentiation, preference for Snapdragon brand. And I think that has had a contribution on the gross margin on the handset business. But also, we pointed out that in China it represents 20% of the market. The premium tier devices, whether Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Honor, Huawei for 4G as well as devices such as Samsung, they're all powered by Qualcomm. And that is why we've been benefiting from growth in a richer mix of premium and high. We're not that much impacted by the low-tier units. And we've been less interested in commodity units in the handset business. Having said that, regardless of what's happened in the China market, I think the story on IoT is strong.

The 50% number in this fiscal year is great, significantly above my estimates, just like what Rod just said about his. But as you think about the moving parts that drove that, how much of, say, the $10 billion SAM opportunity you talked about in China will already have been addressed? And if you've gone from 40% to 75% penetration than the Samsung Galaxy S22, how much more is there? So really, what I'm getting at is how long can you outgrow the handset market by content and market share gains if you're doing so well now?",

So that would be one driver. Second is 4G to 5G transition. We have some ways to go on that for the rest of the market. So we should see that play out, and that should benefit us as well. The third driver is what we discussed earlier, where the amount of processing that's needed. And this is whether it's CPU or GPU, AI camera, audio, video security, each of these vectors are being pushed hard in terms of performance, and the competitive landscape between the OEMs is demanding that all these capabilities get added to the handset. So that is also helping us from a content increase perspective. And then those are the drivers as we look forward.",

So content on the processor side has been the biggest driver of higher ASPs and gross margins in handsets. The other thing I want to continue to point out, which is as we leverage our one technology roadmap to grow in the other business. And in the quarter, 61% growth in IoT. In automotive, we added $3 billion to the design win pipeline. That's all accretive to margin, highly leveraged from the R&D that we do in mobile.",

Also to keep in mind that typically, the new Apple phone launch happens in the fall timeframe, and that would be a driver as well. Yes. We reported that IoT total revenue increased by 61% year-over-year, which is very encouraging. When examining the breakdown, enterprise, consumer, and edge networking all grew by more than 50% each, indicating widespread growth rather than concentration in one area. As Cristiano noted, the strongest growth originated from the enterprise channel, which is very positive for us.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I\u2019m very pleased with our performance in fiscal Q3 and how we continue to execute on our long-term vision of enabling a world where everyone and everything is intelligently connected. As we continue to scale our One Technology Roadmap across new industries and applications, we are transforming Qualcomm from a communications company for the mobile industry into a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. This quarter, we delivered revenues of $10.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.96 per share, driven by solid results in both our chipset and licensing businesses. In our chipset business, revenues of $9.4 billion were up 45% year-over-year with record revenues in IoT and automotive, demonstrating the success of our diversification strategy. Before I highlight a few notable milestones this quarter, I would like to update you on an important development in our relationship with Samsung. We\u2019re very pleased to report that Qualcomm and Samsung have entered a new multiyear agreement starting in 2023, expanding the use of Snapdragon platforms for future premium Samsung Galaxy products globally. This validates the Snapdragon as the technology platform of choice for premium Android experiences. In addition to Galaxy smartphones, the agreement includes PCs, tablets, extended reality and more. We have also agreed to a seven-year extension of our patent license agreement with Samsung, taking the license through the end of 2030 with the same royalty terms. The extension encompasses 3G, 4G, and 5G technologies and devices and will also include future 6G standards and products. This license agreement is a significant QTL milestone event. Samsung is the world\u2019s largest smartphone supplier by unit volume with a well-developed portfolio of patents. The extended license agreement with Samsung demonstrates the tremendous ongoing value of our patent portfolio, our innovation, and our longstanding leadership in driving the important and foundational elements of the mobile roadmap. The extended Samsung license agreement is an important benchmark for the long term and adds significantly to the stability of the QTL program going forward. Let me now share some of the key achievements from the quarter. In automotive, the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is fast becoming the industry\u2019s platform of choice and is enabling the transition to next-generation vehicles. We are very pleased with the continued traction and design wins across global automakers and Tier 1 partners. Our automotive design win pipeline is now over $19 billion, up approximately $3 billion since fiscal Q2. This includes the design win with the Volkswagen Group\u2019s software company, CARIAD, to power Volkswagen\u2019s future automated driving solutions. In consumer IoT, we continue to execute on our opportunities across tablets, XR, PCs, and smart consumer devices. For personal computing, we are continuing to drive the inevitable transition to ARM. We are on track to deliver Windows on Snapdragon compute platforms for next-generation PCs powered by our custom CPUs while redefining mobile productivity and on-device AI. To support the accelerating transition to ARM-based computing, Microsoft recently announced Project Volterra, a new developer kit powered by the Snapdragon compute platform featuring the Qualcomm AI engine. They also announced a comprehensive end-to-end ARM native toolchain for Windows application developers including Visual Studio, Visual C++ .NET and more. In edge networking, we launched four new networking Pro Series Wi-Fi 7 platforms, the world\u2019s most scalable Wi-Fi 7 portfolio, initiating a new era of 10 gigabits per second Wi-Fi for enterprise access points, Wi-Fi mesh, carrier gateways, and premium home routers. We also continue to see strong momentum in industrial IoT and recently announced two new 5G connected robotics platforms with enhanced AI capabilities, computer vision, 5G connectivity, and a comprehensive customizable SDK, to power next-generation robotics and drones, including autonomous mobile robots, AMRs, highly automated manufacturing robots, and more. These achievements demonstrate our ability to continue to grow across automotive in the broader IoT categories in addition to RF front-end and handsets. Our One Technology Roadmap is the cornerstone of the strategy with unparalleled leadership across not one, but multiple technologies required for the connected intelligent edge. This includes on-device AI, low-power, high-performance compute, computer vision, advanced connectivity, and more. Importantly, as we expand into new growth areas, we\u2019re driving our technologies to meet the highest performance requirement for each application and serve as the industry design point. For example, our dedicated automotive SoCs and accelerators for Level 3 and Level 4 autonomous driving can deliver up to 700 trillion operations per second, TOPS of AI processing. Our RB6 robotics platform brings advanced edge AI and video processing capabilities support for up to 7 concurrent cameras and up to 200 TOPS. And we believe our upcoming custom-designed CPUs will redefine computing performance for Windows PCs. Of particular note is our significant momentum in AI. We recently launched the Qualcomm AI Stack, which unifies our existing best-in-class AI software solutions into a single package that works across all Qualcomm platforms. The Qualcomm AI Stack is positioned to become the platform for AI at the edge. The Qualcomm AI Stack supports all AI frameworks, including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX as well as AI runtimes such as TensorFlow Lite, TensorFlow Lite Micro, and ONNX runtime. We also have a rich variety of OS support, including Android, Windows, Linux, QNX, Ubuntu, and others. With this new offering, OEMs and developers can now develop and optimize AI models once, then move the same model across different Qualcomm products and tiers for true develop once, deploy anywhere model. We believe the Qualcomm AI Stack portfolio is a revolutionary step in scaling high-performance, low-power on-device AI processing. These solutions demonstrate how our One Technology Roadmap is transforming Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. Lastly, as we continue to move forward and execute on our strategy, we\u2019re mindful of the challenging economic environment, and we remain disciplined on investments that drive sustainable differentiation and stockholder value. We are focused on customers and industries that drive stable long-term growth. We believe the industry trends that are driving demand for our technologies remain unchanged and continue to validate our strategy, positioning us well for the long term. We\u2019re still on track to expand our addressable market by more than 7 times to approximately $700 billion in the next decade. Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to invite you to join us in New York on September 22nd at our first ever Automotive Investor Day event. Qualcomm is the leading automotive technology platform provider for next-generation vehicles. We will demonstrate how the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is enabling the transformation of the automobile and continuing to drive growth in our design win pipeline. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to report strong results in our third fiscal quarter despite the impact of the challenging economic environment. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $10.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.96, which was above the high end of our guidance. Non-GAAP revenues and EPS grew by 37% and 50%, respectively, versus the year ago quarter, driven by technology leadership, revenue diversification, and operating efficiency. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 71% were at the midpoint of guidance. These results reflect a decrease in handset volume in mid and low tiers offset by favorable mix. QCT recorded revenues of $9.4 billion and EBT margin of 32%, both at the midpoint of our guidance and reflecting revenue growth of 45% and EBT dollar growth of 67% versus the year-ago quarter. Handset revenues of $6.1 billion increased 59% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our Snapdragon product portfolio, especially in the premium and high tiers. Consistent with our guidance, RF front-end revenues of $1 billion, grew 9% versus the year-ago quarter on increased adoption of our broad product portfolio. IoT revenues were up 31% year-over-year to $1.8 billion. We saw strong performance across edge networking and industrial IP with combined revenue growth of more than 40%. We delivered another record quarter in automotive, with revenues of $350 million with year-over-year growth of 38%, driven by launches with our digital cockpit products. Looking forward to global 3G, 4G, 5G handset forecast. We now expect calendar \u201822 global handsets to decrease by mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis, including 650 million to 700 million 5G handsets. Our guidance reflects the continuation of the trends that adversely impacted handset volumes exiting the June quarter. We expect the elevated uncertainty in the global economy and the impact of COVID measures in China will cause customers to act with caution in managing their purchases in the second half of calendar \u201822. In the fourth fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $11 billion to $11.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3 to $3.30. The midpoint of our guidance includes an estimated impact of approximately $0.20 due to the macroeconomic headwinds and the reduction in the global handset forecast I just outlined. We are forecasting QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%, reflecting normal sequential unit growth. In QCT, we expect revenues of $9.5 billion to $10.1 billion and EBT margins of 32% to 34%. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of 27% and EBT dollar growth of 31%. On a sequential basis, we expect growth across QCT handset and automotive revenue streams. In handsets, while Snapdragon premium tier volume remains resilient, our guidance assumes lower demand in other tiers, reflecting the updated global handset forecast. In IoT, we are seeing strength across industrial and enterprise, which is offset by pockets of weakness in consumer products. We anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to be up 6% to 8% sequentially, with approximately half of the growth due to the inclusion of two quarters of expenses for the Arriver acquisition. As a reminder, our third-quarter results did not include Arriver since we are reporting one quarter in arrears until the fourth fiscal quarter. Based on the midpoint of our fourth-quarter guidance, we\u2019re expecting fiscal \u201822 to be an exceptional year. We expect non-GAAP EPS of $12.55, a growth of $4 for fiscal \u201821. We are forecasting QCT revenues of greater than $37 billion, a year-over-year growth of greater than $10 billion and EBT margin expansion of approximately 5 points. QCT handset revenues are on track to grow slightly below 50% relative to fiscal \u201821, driven by increased processor content and expansion of our addressable market. With our continued focus on diversification, we are forecasting RF front-end, IoT, and automotive combined revenues of greater than $12 billion in fiscal \u201822. Lastly, we are pleased to announce we signed a long-term extension of our license agreement with Samsung through 2030 at the same royalty terms. With this agreement, the QTL forecast that we provided at Investor Day remains unchanged. In closing, while we are mindful of the current environment, our long-term fundamentals are intact. We remain focused on driving growth by executing on our vision to bring cloud connectivity, data processing, and artificial intelligence to the edge. Thank you, and back to you, Mauricio.",

We look at the combination of the macroeconomic environment and the China lockdowns, we did see the market is likely to be smaller than we originally forecasted. But, on the positive side, I think our strategy of being focused on the premium and high tier is proven to be a resilient one. So, the weakness we saw more in the mid to low tiers, premium tier remained resilient and not only in how we report the results in Q3, but how we think about our guide in Q4.

Regarding the cash balance, we completed the Arriver acquisition shortly after the March quarter ended. The noticeable change is mainly due to the $4.6 billion used for the acquisition. We did experience robust positive cash flow, but this was offset by capital returns, amounting to $1.4 billion, specifically $1.35 billion in the quarter. Additionally, there were other related expenses from CapEx and tax payments during the quarter. So, the primary impact comes from the payment made for the Arriver acquisition.  As for the RF front-end, you should consider its growth as closely tied to the 5G market trends. We have adjusted our overall forecast for 5G units for the year, which has influenced the situation. Generally, the scaling does not increase significantly when moving from low mid-tier to high tier; the RF content remains fairly consistent. In contrast, the processor side has witnessed substantial scaling within our handset business, especially as we transition to premium high tiers. Here, the average selling prices and content are significantly higher, and you can observe that benefit manifesting at the upper end of the range.",

We announced our next-generation Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for RF front-end modules to go over chips as well. So, we expect to be focusing on driving growth in auto and IoT.

If you look at the guidance range we gave, we widened the range given the uncertainty and also estimated that our guidance midpoint had an impact of about $0.20 related to the macroeconomic. If you break that down on your direct question, premium tier volume is holding, right? So just from overall Snapdragon, and of course, the new launch happens as planned as well.

The way I will unpack that is, we have the macro, we have the reduction in the mobile market, but if you break that down, in addition to what Akash said about the premium tier being resilient even as we have less units in mid and low, we have sequential growth in auto. We had record auto Q3. We see sequential growth in QT. And in the IoT, I think consistent with what we have been in the conversation throughout this earnings season is any offset in any consumer weakness has been offset by strength in industrial and enterprise. And so, when we look at those numbers, a 24% year-over-year growth is actually faster than some of our peers, who have even less consumer exposure than we do because of mobile. Thank you.",

The second part of this multiyear agreement includes growth opportunities linked to our diversification, expanding beyond Galaxy smartphones to also cover Galaxy books, Windows PCs, Galaxy tablets, future extended reality devices, and more.

Now that we\u2019re getting closer to that timeline, has your view changed at all by that share?

And then, in addition to that, obviously, a pretty aggressive capital return program. So, it\u2019s really a combination of those factors. When I step back and to your direct question, no change to our strategy that we outlined at Investor Day. We are very focused on returning most of our free cash flow to the shareholders.

It does not mean that we\u2019re not going to serve opportunities in the mid and low.

There\u2019s a lot more demand for processor content, whether it\u2019s CPU, GPU, camera, AI, security, audio video, we are increasing content across the board. And so, we do expect that that will drive stronger revenue growth on the handset side. As Cristiano mentioned on RF front-end, of course, we\u2019ll benefit from the transition to 5G, which as markets like India start deploying 5G later this year, we\u2019ll see the benefit of expansion of SAM since 5G is where we really play there, and then also for auto and IoT expansion opportunities.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Fiscal '22 has been a strong year for Qualcomm with record performance in our chipset business and a strong execution of our diversification and growth strategy. We remain focused on continuing to transition Qualcomm from a wireless communications company for the mobile industry to a connected processor company for the intelligent edge. We're driving the transformation of industries and growth of the digital economy by powering the billions of smart connected devices at the edge, utilizing our One Technology Roadmap with leadership in wireless connectivity, high-performance, low-power computing and on-device AI. While the semiconductor industry is being impacted by significant macroeconomic headwinds and other short-term challenges from which we're not immune, the fundamentals of Qualcomm's growth drivers remain unchanged with significant opportunities in the coming years. In Q4, we delivered record revenues of $11.4 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.13, reflecting record revenues in our chipset business and solid performance in licensing. QCT revenues of $9.9 billion were up 28% year-over-year, including record performance across handsets, automotive and IoT. Fiscal '22 revenues of $44 billion were up 32% year-over-year. QCT, the growth engine of the company, contributed revenues of $37.7 billion, up 39% year-over-year with combined fiscal year IoT and automotive revenues growing 38% year-over-year. QTL delivered $6.4 billion in revenues. Let me now summarize a few highlights from the fiscal year. In handsets, we entered into a new multiyear agreement with Samsung, expanding the use of Snapdragon platforms for future premium Samsung Galaxy products globally. We also executed on the changing OEM landscape opportunity, securing key premium and high-tier design wins with our customers in China. Snapdragon has become synonymous with premium mobile experiences worldwide. In automotive, our design win pipeline across connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS is now greater than $30 billion. We also completed the acquisition of Arriver, which enhances our ability to deliver open, scalable, fully integrated and competitive ADAS solutions. Importantly, we have firmly established ourselves as a key strategic and technology partner for the automotive industry, and the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is now the preferred platform for next-generation vehicles. In IoT, we extended our chipset roadmap to capitalize on trends driving the connected intelligent edge, notably, the convergence of personal computing with mobile; the intersection of physical and virtual spaces; the enterprise transformation of the home; the expansion of broadband; and the ongoing digital transformation across many verticals. In consumer IoT, we increased OEM design wins in ecosystem traction for our next-generation Windows on Snapdragon solutions, which incorporate our custom CPUs. The game-changing AI capabilities of our Snapdragon compute platform recently demonstrated at Microsoft Ignite 2022 developer conference will redefine user experiences on Windows 11. We also announced a multiyear agreement with Meta to develop premium virtual reality and mixed reality experiences starting with next-generation devices powered by custom Snapdragon XR platforms. We continue to be a leading platform provider for virtually all commercially available and announced XR devices and remain well positioned as XR develops. In edge networking IoT, we have seen positive share traction related to the rollout of WiFi 6 and 6E solutions for enterprise access points and retail mesh systems. We are seeing strong interest in new design wins for our WiFi 7 solutions. Additionally, our 5G fixed wireless access broadband solution is now the industry's platform of choice for wireless fiber globally. In industrial IoT, we built a strong foundation for growth with significant wins across industrial handhelds, robotics, payments, gateways, smart cameras, enterprise collaboration and edge processing. The growing diversity of these end markets positions us well to benefit from durable and margin-accretive growth opportunities in industrial. In licensing, we extended our agreement with Samsung through 2030, establishing an important benchmark for the long term and for future renegotiations. In addition to delivering record financial results, our fiscal '22 achievements validate our strategy and have provided a strong foundation for long-term growth. As we look to fiscal '23, further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and extended China COVID restrictions have resulted in demand weakness and temporary elevated channel inventory across the industry. As good stewards of capital for our stockholders, we are committed to managing our business in light of the current environment without losing sight of the significant growth opportunities ahead. To that end, we're being very disciplined in managing operating expenses while optimizing our R&D investments to prudently focus on growth within automotive and IoT. We have already implemented a hiring freeze, and we have planned spending reductions across our mature product areas and SG&A to fund our diversification. We are continuing to evaluate additional actions, and we are prepared and committed to making further reductions to operating expenses as needed. It is important to note that the current inventory drawdown is a cyclical adjustment that has no impact on the underlying growth and earnings power of the company in the long term. And we are in a strong position to manage the near-term headwinds. Beyond 2023, we see a number of our strategic growth initiatives increasing in scale. We anticipate automotive revenues will grow consistent with our auto Investor Day projections as the design win pipeline materializes. We expect to see an inflection point in Windows on Snapdragon PCs in 2024 based on a significant number of design wins to date. XR is just at the beginning of its growth curve. 5G wireless fiber presents significant opportunities in regions such as India and other developing economies that have just started to deploy 5G networks. Lastly, the digital transformation of industries will continue to gain momentum, driving connectivity and intelligence at the edge. In summary, despite the short-term challenges, the fundamentals of our growth strategy remain intact. We remain confident in our ability to navigate the current economic downturn given our strong balance sheet and consistent history of strong free cash flow generation. We will continue to focus on stockholder returns and executing on our ongoing diversification opportunities. The powerful secular tailwinds driving multiyear demand for our One Technology Roadmap across multiple end industries are unchanged and resilient. We remain on track to expand our addressable market by more than 7x to approximately $700 billion in the next decade and firmly establish Qualcomm as the connected processor company for the intelligent edge. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. In a challenging macroeconomic environment, we are pleased to announce strong fourth quarter results with record revenues of $11.4 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.13. These results reflect year-over-year increases of 22% and 23% in revenues and EPS, respectively, driven by strength across QCT. This was also a record quarter for QCT revenues of $9.9 billion and EBT margin of 34%, both above the midpoint of our guidance with year-over-year revenue growth of 28% and EBT dollar growth of 37%. Handset revenues of $6.6 billion increased 40% versus the year ago quarter on strength of our Snapdragon product portfolio across premium and high tiers. As expected, RF front-end revenues of $992 million were impacted by the continued weakness of the handset market and channel inventory. IoT revenues were up 24% year-over-year to $1.9 billion on growth across edge networking and industrial IoT. Automotive revenues of $427 million grew 58% versus the year ago quarter due to the broad adoption of our Snapdragon Digital Chassis. QTL revenues of $1.4 billion and EBT margin of 69% reflected the impact of lower handset units relative to our expectations at the beginning of the quarter. Turning to fiscal '22 results. We delivered record non-GAAP revenues and EPS with year-over-year growth of 32% and 47%, respectively. In addition, looking over the past 2 fiscal years, we've more than doubled our non-GAAP revenues and almost tripled non-GAAP EPS from fiscal '20 to fiscal '22, underscoring the strong momentum across our businesses. In QCT, we had records across all revenue streams as well as approximately 500 basis points of EBT margin expansion from 29% in fiscal '21 to 34% in fiscal '22. We are pleased with the continued success of our diversification strategy as we delivered year-over-year combined revenue growth of 38% across IoT and automotive. Lastly, we continue to be disciplined in delivering long-term stockholder value. We executed on our capital return commitments, returning 93% of our free cash flow, including $3.2 billion in dividends and $3.1 billion in stock repurchases. Before turning to first quarter guidance, I'll address how our near-term financial outlook is impacted by the challenges facing the semiconductor industry. As we communicated during the last earnings call, we had started to see a deceleration in demand for mass-tier handsets in consumer IoT. Since then, the further deterioration of the macroeconomic environment and sustained COVID restrictions in China have led to broad-based demand weakening across tiers and regions. Given these considerations, we now project 3G, 4G, 5G handset volumes in calendar 2022 to decline by low double digits on a year-over-year basis, including 600 million to 650 million 5G handsets. This rapid deterioration in demand and easing of supply constraints across the semiconductor industry have resulted in elevated channel inventory. Due to these elevated levels, our largest customers have made significant changes to their inventory policy. They are now drawing down on their inventory, negatively impacting our near-term financial performance. Based on our current assessment, we estimate that there are roughly 8 to 10 weeks of elevated inventory in the channel. While the environment is very dynamic, based on the information we have today, we believe this may take a couple of quarters to work itself through with more than half of the inventory drawdown completed in the first fiscal quarter. We are confident in our ability to navigate this environment successfully, and we'll continue to monitor inventory levels and order patterns closely. As Cristiano outlined, while we navigate this downturn, we've already implemented specific actions to manage our spending levels, including the hiring freeze and reductions in handsets, other mature product areas and SG&A. We will remain disciplined and be prepared to take further decisive actions on additional reductions to operating expenses if the macroeconomic environment continues to deteriorate. Turning to guidance for the first fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $9.2 billion to $10 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.45. The midpoint of our guidance includes an estimated impact of approximately $2 billion in revenue and $0.80 in EPS related to the drawdown of channel inventory with the remaining impact primarily due to weaker end-market demand and foreign exchange headwinds. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.7 billion to $8.3 billion and EBT margins of 26% to 28%. Following the record performance in the fourth quarter, we expect our handsets and IoT revenue streams to be down sequentially due to the impacts I just described. On a year-over-year basis, we still expect revenue growth across IoT and automotive. We estimate QTL revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 71% to 75%. This estimate reflects the updated handset forecast, including a muted seasonal benefit for the holiday quarter and approximately $50 million headwind from foreign exchange on a year-over-year basis. Lastly, we now anticipate non-GAAP operating expenses to decrease 3% to 5% sequentially. Before I conclude, I'd like to provide an update on RF front-end revenue stream disclosure and planning assumption for Apple product revenues. We have grown our RF front-end revenues to become the #1 player in handsets due to the breadth and strength of our product portfolio. Looking forward, we expect growth to be driven by our strong design win pipeline for 5G and WiFi 7 platforms across handsets, automotive and IoT. As a result, starting in fiscal '23, we will consolidate RF front-end revenues within handsets, automotive and IoT revenue streams. In addition, we'll continue to provide periodic updates on the combined RF front-end revenues against our Investor Day target. For Apple product revenue, we now expect to have the vast majority of share of 5G modems for the 2023 iPhone launch, up from our previous 20% assumption. Beyond this, there are no changes to our planning assumption, and we are assuming minimal contribution from Apple product revenues in fiscal '25. In closing, while the current backdrop presents near-term headwinds for our industry, we remain confident in our leading technology roadmap, deep customer relationships and strong balance sheet to help us navigate these challenges and maintain our leadership position. Our diversification strategy and long-term growth opportunities remain intact as we continue to drive our vision to bring cloud connectivity, data processing and artificial intelligence to the edge.

In the smartphone markets, we have observed a combination of weak demand, driven by macroeconomic challenges and the ongoing impact of COVID in China, which has significantly affected that market. This situation mainly involves consumers of handsets. Another critical issue we have discussed is the transition from a demand-constrained environment to one where many companies had higher inventory levels. As the supply chain improved, and coupled with macroeconomic uncertainty, there has been a need to reduce inventory to align with current demand. This is beginning to affect the premium tier as customers adjust their inventory levels accordingly. However, we anticipate that as we explore next-generation opportunities, we will see an increase in average selling prices (ASP) due to our enhanced processor content, positioning us strongly in the premium tier. Notably, every premium-tier device from Apple contains Qualcomm components, and the best performance is seen with Snapdragon across Samsung and our clients in China.

Looking ahead, we believe the OEM inventory reduction is a temporary issue that will last a couple of quarters, not a long-term challenge. This should guide your projections for the remainder of the year. On the market side, due to current uncertainties, we are planning with the assumption that market weakness will continue throughout the fiscal year.

So we've gone from $3 billion in fiscal '20 to $7 billion, $6.9 billion in '22. And then the quarter we reported was a record quarter for IoT at $1.9 billion of revenue. So pretty happy with how the business is doing. Now in terms of the macro environment impacting the IoT market overall, and it's less about Qualcomm, it's about the overall macro environment. We're definitely seeing the impact of that on consumer and in some ways synonymous with handsets. Edge networking is holding for us. And we're seeing some minor pockets of weakness in industrial. But overall, I think when you kind of step back and look at where our IoT opportunity exists, for us, it's about digital transformation and about connecting everything to the cloud. And our technology portfolio is perfectly suited to enable various industries to do that. So we feel pretty optimistic longer term.",

It's showing that, as we expect in the mobile market, especially on the premium tier, it's about a flagship product every year. Soon, I think we're going to announce our next-generation Snapdragon in our Tech Summit in a couple of weeks, and I think design traction is very, very high. I think what we see right now is, structurally, we're very well positioned. If you look of the agreement we have with Samsung, plus the change of OEM landscape in China and how that positions Snapdragon as the premium and high-tier device, I think we're just going to see the fluctuations on the market size and how we deal in the short term with the inventory. But you should assume that the mobile market is going to continue to do its thing and we're going to have a product cycle transition.

On the OpEx side, as we deal with the short-term headwinds, we're clearly taking action on things that we control. As Cristiano mentioned, we've implemented a hiring freeze. We're reducing our spending in mature businesses, including handsets and SG&A. And then we're optimizing our R&D investments to increase focus on automotive and IoT, which is obviously the core of our strategy on diversification.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q1, despite the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and short-term challenges impacting the semiconductor industry, we delivered revenues of $9.5 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $2.37 per share, including year-over-year growth in QCT Automotive and IoT. QCT revenues of $7.9 billion were down 11% year-over-year as a result of weaker handset demand and inventory drawdown. In the current quarter, combined auto and IoT revenues represent 27% of total QCT revenues, reflecting continued progress on revenue diversification. QTL delivered $1.5 billion in revenues within Q1. As the handset industry continues to experience reduced demand, we are now expecting elevated channel inventory levels to persist at least through the first half of calendar \u201823. In addition, multiple end industries within IoT are also experiencing weaker-than-expected demand and elevated inventory levels. Given the current macroeconomic and demand environment, we\u2019re implementing further spending reductions and streamlining operations without losing sight of the significant growth and diversification opportunities ahead. This is consistent with our commitment to actively manage operating expenses as indicated during our last earnings call. Combined with the actions we have already taken in the quarter, we expect to reduce non-GAAP operating expenses by approximately 5% relative to a run rate exiting fiscal \u201822. Despite near-term headwinds, our long-term growth opportunities remain unchanged. Our leading technologies, such as advanced wireless connectivity; high-performance, low-power compute and on-device intelligence are enabling the ongoing trends of digital transformation across industries. From a product and technology perspective, we believe we are in the strongest position in our history. Our strategy is working, and we remain focused on expanding our addressable market to approximately $700 billion in the next decade and firmly establishing Qualcomm as the connected processor company for the intelligent edge. I will now provide key highlights from across our business. In automotive, the industry continues to evolve at an unprecedented rate, driven by the adoption of digital technologies. The software-defined vehicle is at the core of this transformation, offering automakers a significant opportunity to deliver enhanced connectivity, improved safety and security features, increased levels of autonomy as well as new business models and revenue streams. We believe the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is the industry\u2019s preferred purpose-built platform to help drive this innovation for the next generation of vehicles. At CES, we announced Snapdragon Ride Flex, which enables digital cockpit, advanced driver assistance systems and automated driving functions to coexist on a single SoC, a first for the automotive industry. Automakers and Tier 1s can now scale a unified center compute and software-defined vehicle architecture across their portfolio. We also demonstrated our expansion into two-wheelers with the latest infotainment and cloud connected digital services to enhance safety and deliver a more personal experience for riders. Our solutions also enable OEMs and fleet providers to deliver over-the-air updates, subscription services, remote diagnostics, geofencing, theft protection, and more. We are very proud of the progress we have made in automotive, and we believe that we are the best positioned technology partner to help drive this industry into the future. In handsets, our recently announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform begins a new era of AI accelerated experiences for smartphones. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 includes our first-ever AI-powered camera processor that enables real-time semantic segmentation for photos and videos. A dedicated 5G AI processor that can enhance 5G data speeds, coverage, latency, and battery life and an updated general-purpose AI engine with a larger tensor accelerator for increased formats. We are also pleased to enable the world\u2019s first satellite-based two-way capable messaging solution for Android smartphones. Snapdragon Satellite will provide global connectivity for messaging, utilizing Iridium\u2019s weather-resilient L-band spectrum and will initially be available on next-generation premium smartphones using Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 within the second half of 2023. Yesterday, I was pleased to join Samsung\u2019s Unpacked event, where they launched the Galaxy S23 family of smartphones, powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform for Galaxy globally. This premium platform features accelerated performance and unique customizations made possible by our expanded strategic partnership with Samsung. The Galaxy S23 represents the first smartphone announced from this partnership. In IoT, which is poised to become our largest addressable market, our revenue stream spans across three categories: consumer, edge networking, and industrial. In consumer IoT, our next-generation PC platform with integrated custom Oryon CPUs and upgraded AI engine has sampled on time and is exceeding our internal KPIs, delivering disruptive CPU performance per watt across tiers. In addition, Snapdragon\u2019s AI capabilities and leading battery life open unique new possibilities for differentiated user experiences for the modern workforce. Key examples are Windows Studio Effects, including portrait blur, eye framing, and noise cancellation with voice focus. Together with Microsoft, we\u2019re broadly engaged with the app ecosystem and are pleased that native applications have been launched for Windows on Snapdragon by market-leading ISVs such as Zoom, Amazon Prime Video, VMware Carbon Black, Cisco AnyConnect, and CrowdStrike. Additionally, as Adobe announced at our Tech Summit, its creativity suite of apps, including Adobe Photoshop, Lightroom, Fresco, and Acrobat will run natively on Snapdragon. We\u2019re now engaged with major PC OEMs with multiple platform design wins across their product roadmaps for consumer and commercial. In edge networking IoT our Wi-Fi infrastructure and networking products continue to gain share, led by strength in enterprise Wi-Fi access points and carrier gateways. We see several trends that are favorable to our Wi-Fi solutions. Wi-Fi mesh networking continues to grow in popularity worldwide, increasing the number of Wi-Fi chipsets installed per home. The hybrid work trend appears to have had lasting impacts on enterprise networking with workers relying on real-time collaboration tools regardless of whether they are in the office or remote. Broadband internet service providers are turning increasingly to a modular software development model, creating new opportunities for Qualcomm in next-generation home gateway routers, and the transition from Wi-Fi 6 and 6E to Wi-Fi 7, which we\u2019re currently leading across home, enterprise, and carrier segments. In 5G, fixed wireless access, we\u2019re encouraged by the significant momentum in India following the recent 5G auctions. Operators have publicly stated their ambition to provide broadband services to 100 million homes using 5G FWA. Qualcomm is well positioned to enable the 5G FWA ecosystem in India with our leading product portfolio on 5G millimeter wave-based high-power CPEs complemented by small cell and compact macro cell infrastructure modem RF platforms. We are currently working with CPE and infrastructure OEMs on the commercial rollout in India, spanning both millimeter wave and sub-6 spectrum. In industrial IoT, digital transformation is still in the early phases, and the scale of the opportunity for Qualcomm in the long term across many verticals is significant. In the tracking and logistics space, we believe we have established one of the largest ecosystems of manufacturing partners. Last month, we announced a new IoT optimized modem, the QCX216 for applications such as smart utility meters, trackers, e-mobility, parking meters, home automation, and security and other location-based solutions. The QCX216 reduces power consumption by up to 80% versus the previous generation solution while also enabling customers to design modules with an up to 40% lower cost structure. In retail, our point-of-sale solutions continue to drive the transition from traditional terminals to full-feature Android-based terminals. We have shipped over 70 million Snapdragon devices since 2016 into handheld and desktop point-of-sale terminals worldwide. In enterprise video collaboration, we\u2019re leading this rapidly growing segment, powering many of the key OEMs such as Poly, Logitech, Nit, Cisco, Bose, AVer, and Alibaba. These are just a few examples of our traction within industrial, and we remain excited about the growth prospects as digital transformation accelerates. In summary, the overall long-term growth opportunity for Qualcomm remains unchanged as demand for technology extends to virtually every device at the edge. Our track record of innovation provides a unique perspective and capability to be at the forefront of the digital transformation across new and diverse end markets. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining our call during a busy earnings week. I\u2019ll start with our first fiscal quarter results. Consistent with our prior guidance, we delivered revenues of $9.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.37. QTL recorded revenues of $1.52 billion and EBT margin of 73%, reflecting slightly lower global handset units. QCT revenues were $7.9 billion and EBT margin was at the high end of our guidance range at 28%. Handset revenues of $5.8 billion reflected the impact of industry-wide headwinds we had previously communicated. IoT revenues were up 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, mainly driven by growth from our edge networking products. Automotive continued its momentum with year-over-year revenue growth of 58% to $456 million, driven by the adoption of our Snapdragon Digital Chassis. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than our guidance, decreasing 6% sequentially, which includes the benefit of certain cost actions we outlined last quarter. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.2 billion in cash and marketable securities at the end of the first fiscal quarter. In addition, we expect to receive a majority of the transaction price of $1.5 billion on the completion of the sale of Veoneer\u2019s active safety business to Magna by SSW Partners. We expect the transaction to close by the end of the fiscal year. We returned $2.1 billion to stockholders, including $1.3 billion in stock repurchases and $842 million in dividends, in line with our capital return program. Lastly, our GAAP EPS results included a $0.10 benefit from the U.S. tax requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses. This benefit is excluded from our non-GAAP results. Before turning to second fiscal quarter guidance, I\u2019ll provide an update on short-term cyclical headwinds facing the semiconductor industry. The environment continues to be dynamic with challenging macroeconomic conditions and COVID headwinds in China, driving industry-wide demand weakness. Given this uncertainty, we are incorporating a negative bias for 3G, 4G, 5G handset volumes for calendar \u201823 relative to calendar \u201822. The impact of broadening demand weakness across handsets and IoT products and the easing of supply constraints has contributed to elevated channel inventory. Based on our current assessment, we expect QCT customers to continue to draw down on inventory, at least through the second and third fiscal quarters. At this point, we\u2019re optimistic that the demand and channel inventory may normalize during the second half of the calendar year, and we remain in a strong position to take advantage of the opportunity when it occurs. While our business is not immune to the macro environment, we are confident in our ability to navigate this landscape. As Cristiano summarized, we have continued to expand our actions to reduce operating expenses beyond the initiatives we previously outlined. While we are reducing spending on handsets and SG&A, we continue to fund our diversification investments in IoT and automotive, which is consistent with our long-term strategy for the business. The initial benefit of these actions is reflected in our fiscal first quarter results and second quarter guidance. Overall, we are targeting a combined 5% reduction in non-GAAP operating expenses relative to our fiscal \u201822 exit rate. Turning to guidance for the second fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.7 billion to $9.5 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.05 to $2.25. The midpoint of our guidance includes an assumption of lower end market demand and the continued drawdown of channel inventory. We are forecasting QTL revenues of $1.25 billion to $1.45 billion and EBT margins of 66% to 70%, reflecting a sequential seasonal decline in handset units. In QCT, we estimate revenues of $7.4 billion to $8 billion and EBT margins of 25% to 27%. We expect handsets and automotive revenue to be flat sequentially, offset by a reduction in IoT revenues due to the factors I just outlined. We estimate non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2.25 billion. This reflects the typical calendar year increases for certain employee-related costs, offset by the savings from our cost reduction actions. In closing, with the uncertainty of the macro environment, we will remain focused on operating discipline and managing the factors we control. Our diversification strategy is on track, as evidenced by our design win pipeline across IoT and automotive customers. In addition, our long-term secular growth opportunity remains unchanged. We are focused on executing on our strategy, enabled by our leading technology roadmap and best-in-class product portfolio. Thank you. Back to you, Mauricio.",

First, from a gross margin perspective, we did slightly better than our expectations and the results that we announced for the first fiscal quarter. And then, we\u2019re guiding similar margins into the second quarter. So, from a gross margin perspective, we are holding well. And even in the challenging environment we\u2019re in, we are doing a relatively good job. As we\u2019ve said in the past, we always expected that once we get to supply constraints, there\u2019ll be some gross margin pressure, and that was factored into our long-term target. So, there\u2019s really nothing new that we haven\u2019t told you before on the gross margin side. On operating leverage, which is really the second driver here is the impact that we\u2019re seeing from the inventory drawdown reduces the operating leverage in the business temporarily in the short term. And so, you\u2019re seeing the operating margins being impacted by that.

However, as we move into the second half of the calendar year, we hope to see improvements in the inventory situation and the reopening of China. This should provide an opportunity for the mid and low tiers to recover, and our design traction in those segments with the OEMs is positive.

So, we expect our QCT customers to be cautious. And until there is more visibility, they\u2019re going to be careful with additional purchases and draw down inventory. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s factored into our updated guidance. When we look at the second half of the year, as Cristiano said, we\u2019re pretty optimistic that demand and channel inventory normalizes. And that allows us to take advantage of the growth from that point on, given our strong position when the dynamic occurs. In terms of bottom, the way I think about it is we\u2019re going to see impact for the March and June quarters, and I think there\u2019s an opportunity from that point on as we grow in the second half of the year.",

And so, you\u2019ve seen us benefit significantly from that over the last three years. And as we look forward, we are continuing to see demand for additional functionality. So, that\u2019s kind of tier for tier improvement opportunity for us and for the overall industry. And then, the second factor is mix within peers and that, of course, changes across quarters.

As you know well, for leading-edge nodes, which is where we operate, the lead time is 5 to 6 months now for the foundry and chip production. And so, we were clearly starting wafers based on a different market expectation and before the inventory drawdown. So, we\u2019ve calibrated that down. We are working with our suppliers and over time, we\u2019ll get to a reasonable place. It is important to also remember that when you look at three years ago versus today, we\u2019ve grown tremendously in terms of revenue and scale across our businesses.

In the areas that we have more competition, which is mid- to low-tier, we also saw that that\u2019s the one that\u2019s most impacted by the demand weakness.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In a challenging macroeconomic environment and broad downturn across the semiconductor sector, we're pleased to deliver fiscal Q2 results consistent with our prior guidance. We delivered fiscal Q2 revenues of $9.3 billion, and non-GAAP earnings of $2.15 per share were at the midpoint of our guidance. Our chipset business delivered revenues of $7.9 billion near the high end of our guidance range. Our licensing business delivered revenues of $1.3 billion at the low end of the guidance range on weaker demand for handsets. The evolving macroeconomic backdrop has resulted in further demand deterioration, particularly in handsets at a magnitude greater than we previously forecasted. As a result, we're operating under the assumption that inventory drawdown dynamics remain a significant factor for at least the next couple of quarters. Additionally, while expectations are for a rebound in China demand in the second half of the calendar year, we have not seen evidence of meaningful recovery and are not incorporating improvements into our planning assumptions. While the challenges we are facing are impacting the semiconductor industry, we remain focused on managing what is within our control and will continue to execute on our diversification strategy in leading technology and product roadmap. As market visibility remains limited, we're actively managing operating expenses, and we'll continue to evaluate additional opportunities to drive greater operating efficiencies without losing sight of the automotive and IoT growth opportunities ahead. Let me now provide key highlights from across our business. In handsets, we extended our 5G technology and product leadership with the Snapdragon X75 5G modem RF system. The world's first 5G advanced ready modem RF platform will drive the next phase of new 5G capabilities globally, starting in 2024 across segments, device types, and networks. The X75 modem is now the benchmark for 5G performance and features for all flagship smartphone launches next year. Our Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 mobile platform is the standard for Android flagship devices globally, with launches across leading OEMs, including Samsung, Xiaomi, Vivo, Oppo, OnePlus, Honor, Motorola, ASUS, and ZTE. Additionally, our Snapdragon 7 Series is redefining the high tier. Our recently-launched Snapdragon 7+ Gen 2 mobile platform outperforms its competitors' premium-tier solutions, winning multiple accolades for its superior power and performance. We are seeing excellent adoption across Chinese OEMs, resulting in share gains. OEMs are also reporting strong initial sales for products powered by the 7+ Gen 2. In automotive, we see continued traction across global automakers and Tier 1 customers, driven by the increased adoption of our Snapdragon digital chassis. We are very pleased to be partnering with Mercedes-Benz on our next-generation Snapdragon Digital Cockpit platforms. This is a result of our long and close collaboration with the MBition Mercedes-Benz Software Factory and engineering teams and various partners to create an industry-leading MBOS premium cockpit experience. The new platforms will be featured in Mercedes vehicles beginning in 2023. Additionally, our OEM partners recently launched vehicles with our third-generation Snapdragon Cockpit platform, including the Xpeng P7i and Lotus new Eletre SUV. Notably, during the quarter, we won 12 new designs across our Snapdragon Cockpit and Snapdragon Connectivity 5G platforms with automakers globally. We remain on track to execute on the milestones outlined during Automotive Investor Day. In consumer IoT, we continue to be encouraged by the positive momentum with Windows on Snapdragon. Dell recently launched the Inspiron 14-inch laptop powered by the Snapdragon 8cx Gen 2 Compute platform. In addition to OEMs, we're expanding our ecosystem across bios, hardware, software, ODM, and channel partners. We're also launching the Windows on Snapdragon developer portal to enable consumer and enterprise ISVs to test, port, and optimize their applications directly on Qualcomm Silicon. Our next-generation Snapdragon Compute platform, with custom Orion CPUs and industry-leading AI acceleration, is on schedule to enable commercial device launches in 2024. As a reminder, we remain the platform of choice for all significant ecosystem players for XR, notably Meta, the joint partnership with Samsung and Google, and broadly in China. While still in its early phases, we believe the merger of physical and digital spaces will become a significant opportunity for Qualcomm. We also continue to win designs for home robotics, smart appliances, and smart camera applications with household names such as Bosch, LG Electronics, Panasonic, Samsung, and Sony. In Edge Networking IoT, we're very pleased to share that we're now collaborating with Reliance Jio on rolling out 5G FWA across India, servicing millions of residents. We also recently announced the Qualcomm 5G Fixed Wireless Access Platform Gen 3, offering operators the ability to expand their service coverage to new areas while lowering costs and enabling faster deployment. Additionally, we continue to lead the transition to Wi-Fi 7 with more than 175 cumulative designs across all product categories. Access points account for 89 of these designs, with 16 launches in the quarter. In Industrial IoT, we announced the Qualcomm Aware platform to empower developers and enterprises to easily build real-time intelligence and visibility solutions. The platform combines simple, secure, and scalable cloud-based services with power-optimized and precise location tracking and an extensive hardware ecosystem to deliver tailored edge solutions across many industries. Additionally, we led the Bluetooth SIG working group to help establish a new standard for electronic shelf labels that are scalable, ultra-low power, and highly secure. This will help enable large retailers to accelerate the digital transformation of the store with electronic labels that can interact with both store and consumer devices. Our OEM partner, SES-imagotag, recently announced an agreement with Walmart to deploy electronic shelf labels across 500 stores over the next 12 to 18 months. I would now like to provide a perspective on the disruptive trends in the artificial intelligence space and the significant opportunity for Qualcomm. Demand for generative artificial intelligence models is growing at an exponential rate. Generative AI models such as ChatGPT, Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E have already scaled to millions of users in a short period of time. We believe that this model will evolve quickly, continue to grow in popularity, and change user experiences across mobile, personal computing, and automotive. Beyond changing Internet search, this model will impact content creation such as text, images, audio, and video for both entertainment and productivity. It will also transform many industries. For these models to realize their full potential and scale, they will need to run locally on devices at the edge. At Mobile World Congress, we demonstrated the world's first on-device Stable Diffusion, a greater-than-1 billion parameter foundational model for text-to-image applications running completely on a Snapdragon-powered Android smartphone. In the coming months, we will significantly improve performance and be able to run models in excess of 10 billion parameters locally on the device, and we will increase this capability substantially for our products in 2024. Qualcomm is uniquely positioned to enable the proliferation of AI use cases on edge devices. We're advancing AI to make core on-device capabilities ubiquitous such as perception, reasoning, action, and now, content creation. With millions of AI-enabled platform shipments per year, unparalleled AI processing performance per watt in the broadest range of device categories from smartphones to PCs, automotive and IoT, Qualcomm is firmly at the forefront of this upcoming transformation. Further, very large AI models are placing significant incremental demands on energy-intensive and expensive cloud computing infrastructure. As such, a hybrid AI architecture leveraging accelerating computing at the edge can offload or support cloud processing by running AI inferencing directly on the device. Beyond cost optimization, additional benefits of running generative AI on-device include improved latency, security, privacy, and the ability to meet data compliance requirements. This is a new and exciting opportunity for Qualcomm in one of our priority investment areas. As I close my prepared remarks, I would like to reiterate that the secular technology trends driving the long-term growth opportunities for Qualcomm remain unchanged. Despite the disappointing macroeconomic environment, our investments in technology leadership, our best product roadmap, and history and strategic customer relationships across multiple industries position us well to execute on our strategy and expand across new and diverse end markets. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our second fiscal quarter results. Despite a difficult operating environment, we delivered revenues of $9.3 billion, which was above the midpoint of our guidance, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.15. QTL recorded revenues of $1.3 billion and EBT margin of 68%, reflecting lower-than-expected global handset units. On a year-over-year basis, we estimate global handset sell-in units declined by approximately 14%. QCT revenues of $7.9 billion and EBT margin of 27% were both near the high end of our guidance. Handset revenues increased 6% sequentially to $6.1 billion, benefiting from device launches with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2, our latest premium-tier chipset platform. IoT revenues of $1.4 billion reflected a larger-than-expected impact of the macroeconomic environment on demand and channel inventory drawdown. Automotive revenues of $447 million grew 20% year-over-year, driven by the adoption of our Snapdragon digital chassis, and are aligned with our long-term revenue target. Non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.2 billion were favorable relative to our guidance by approximately $80 million. We returned $1.7 billion to stockholders, including $903 million in stock repurchases and $834 million in dividends. Additionally, we are pleased to have announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend, consistent with our commitment to dividend growth. Before turning to our third fiscal quarter guidance, I'll give you an update on cyclical challenges impacting the semiconductor industry. Financial headwinds have increased meaningfully relative to our initial expectations going into the fiscal year. With a combination of an uncertain macroeconomic outlook, persistent inflation, and a slower recovery in China, which continued to impact demand globally. We now expect global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units in calendar '23 to be down at least a high single-digit percentage relative to calendar '22, which is lower than our prior expectation. Given the weaker handset forecast, until demand normalizes and visibility improves, we anticipate that customers will remain cautious with purchases and reduce channel inventory risk further. Within IoT, we continue to see the impact of similar factors as Handsets. Since it remains difficult to predict the timing of a sustained recovery, we are operating under the assumption that the inventory drawdown dynamics will remain a significant factor for at least the next couple of quarters. To effectively navigate this uncertain landscape, we are focused on driving operating efficiencies while maintaining our commitment to invest in diversification and long-term technology leadership. We believe we remain well positioned to capture a rebound in demand once it occurs. We are on track to meet our commitment of a 5% reduction in non-GAAP operating expenses relative to our fiscal '22 exit rate. This includes a further reduction of spending in handsets to fund diversification investments in Automotive and IoT. As the environment continues to evolve, we will evaluate and execute additional cost-reduction opportunities to help exceed our operating expense target. Turning to guidance for the third fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.70 to $1.90. Our guidance reflects the impact of macroeconomic headwinds, weaker global handset units, and channel inventory drawdown. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and EBT margins of 64% to 68%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $6.9 billion to $7.5 billion and EBT margin of 23% to 25%. Based on the midpoint of QCT revenue guidance, we estimate a larger-than-normal sequential decline primarily due to the timing of purchases by a modem-only handset customer. On a sequential basis, we are forecasting Android handsets and Automotive revenues to be roughly flat, with mid-single-digit growth in IoT. Consistent with our previous messaging and second-quarter results, QCT gross margins reflect the impact of the transition from supply constraints to elevated channel inventory, in addition to foundry cost increases. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat sequentially. As we look ahead, we expect the dynamics impacting the third fiscal quarter to extend to the fourth quarter, including the timing of purchases by a modem-only handset customer resulting in muted seasonality in QCT revenues. In closing, while we are not immune to near-term headwinds, we are well positioned to benefit from an eventual recovery in the macro environment. Despite a reduction in global handset units and the continued drawdown of elevated channel inventory, QCT handset revenues have benefited from increased content per device, expanded traction with OEMs, and improved mix across tiers. We remain focused on executing our diversification strategy and positioned ourselves for success in our largest growth opportunities, including Automotive, Industrial, Networking IoT, personal computers, and XR. We're confident in our ability to navigate the current operating environment, given our strong balance sheet and debt rating. Thank you. Back to you, Mauricio.",

Regarding your QCT guidance, it appears that the main challenges you expect are due to inventory and the timing of purchases. Could you confirm if my interpretation is correct?

It's the right thing to connect the market forecast to QTL, and then QCT really has this additional factor that is related to the inventory drawdown. Our view of inventory drawdown is really the macro headwinds have increased meaningfully since the beginning of the fiscal year. So what we've seen is the impact on the market is driving a scenario where it takes longer to run through the existing inventory. We don't have a fundamental change in how much inventory we think the channel had going into the year that was accessed. It's just how long it takes to run through it as a result of the market forecast.",

You clearly mentioned in your statement that the recovery in China during the second half of the year may be somewhat subdued, and you were one of the first companies to highlight this issue. Previously, shipments to China peaked at around 500 million units annually, but now it seems we're closer to 300 million on a sell-through basis. Can you confirm if those numbers are accurate? What are you observing regarding the recovery? Also, how much are you currently undershipping that could positively impact your numbers in the latter half of the year as you adjust shipping to match sell-through?

So if you're quoting that, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but that aligns with what we are seeing. The way we are thinking about the inventory drawdown is, of course, it's a near-term phenomenon. We're going to get past it. The strength of our design win pipeline is very strong, so if you look at our share of sell-through, we\u2019ve seen that share grow from '22 to '23, so that should give you a sense of our position going into the next year.",

Additionally, if we consider the broader digital transformation, our technologies are becoming increasingly relevant.

The new 7 Series has seen significant investments, especially in leveraging the Snapdragon brand, and it is being very well received in the market. Our 7+ has outperformed the competition in the premium tier, which we find favorable as it sets a strong baseline. Additionally, Snapdragon is uniquely positioned in the 8 series.

What we're suggesting is, as I outlined in the prepared remarks, we expect it to be muted because the lower demand from the modem-only handset customer extends from June into the September quarter as well.

And I guess the second part of it is, I think there's a lot of concern about more competitive environment, MediaTek moving up to the high end. So just can you go back and just talk about that environment? I think you said there's no more like-for-like pricing, but I mean, there's a lot of concern about maybe people buying older products and not taking Gen 2 and MediaTek moving up.

Our gross margin dollars per device continues to grow, and that's the strength and it kind of adds scale and profitability to the business. However, we have seen gross margin percent get impacted by the couple of factors I just outlined. But again, those are, to me, kind of ins and outs of the business. It's better to step back and look at the broader longer-term opportunity for us to continue to add content to our chips, which we have done very successfully over the last three years. We have an opportunity to do that, especially with our new custom CPU cores coming into play across all of our product lines, including handsets.

That changes the landscape, which means we are very well positioned above that in the 8 tier, as I outlined. Our design traction is very strong, especially with all of the OEMs, with no exception. I remind you that we are globally associated with Samsung. Our agreement with them means we have launched the GS 23, that just happened, then we have the Fold and Flip, and then we have the GS 24.

There was an addressable market for premium devices, and to some extent, premium and high-tier devices became available as Huawei declined in share. The reality is that Apple gained a significant amount of that share. We did as well, I think. So our competition grew at the expense of the market. That resulted in a much larger decline; you look at Huawei's Android as a net loss for Android, and that's where Apple gained share. The market is smaller, and the component of hand-me-down phones is accounted for in our planning for a smaller market. I think that's where we are until we go to the next upgrade cycle; cyclical business. But our position in Android has improved, and if you look at our trajectory within the smaller Android market, we\u2019ve been gaining share and focusing on the value share of the market with concentration in the high and middle tiers.",

We're taking action where we can control as we navigate the near-term headwinds, but it's most important; we'll continue to execute on our strategy. We like our strategy. I think we're investing in the right technologies for growth and diversification, especially in IoT and Auto. I feel we have a very competitive road map, so we're well positioned to benefit when the market returns to growth. The last comment is we are going to become very relevant in AI. As you look at the speed of new models appearing, new companies investing, new use cases, the ability to run those things locally. I talk about having the ability to run 10 billion parameter models on the phone without compromising battery life and being able to demonstrate that very shortly this year, and you can see how that creates an even larger opportunity for us in Automotive as well as in the entering of next-generation personal computing. So excited about that, we'll continue to invest in this area. In summary, we're very focused on our long-term success, and we're steadfast in our commitment to drive maximum value for our stakeholders.

In our fiscal Q3, we delivered results consistent with our guidance with non-GAAP earnings of $1.87 per share, above the midpoint of our guidance. We recorded fiscal Q3 non-GAAP revenues of $8.4 billion, including $7.2 billion from our chipset business and $1.2 billion from our licensing business. This quarter also marked our 11th straight quarter of year-over-year double-digit percentage growth in QCT Automotive revenues. We are pleased with our technology, product and design win execution, positioning us well for continued leadership enhancements and future growth and diversification in automotive and IoT. I will now share some highlights from across the business. Our Snapdragon Series mobile platforms continue to set the benchmark for premium tier mobile experiences. Smartphones powered by our Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 represent the top devices according to Antutu benchmarks in Android Authority. We are also pleased that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 for Galaxy will again power Samsung's newest flagship device lineup globally. The Galaxy Z Flip, Galaxy Z Fold 5, and the Galaxy Tab S9 series. Our fastest Snapdragon ever for Samsung defines a new standard in smartphone computing capabilities AI experiences, desktop-level gaming features, professional-grade photography, enhanced mobile productivity, and more. This launch underscores Qualcomm and Samsung's mutual commitment to delivering premium consumer experiences for flagship Galaxy devices. We are extremely proud of our successful partnership with Samsung Mobile. We are also pleased to extend Snapdragon experiences to mass-market 5G smartphones. The redesigned Snapdragon for Gen 2 mobile platform will bring premium experiences at reduced prices to help drive 4G to 5G migration, especially in new 5G deployments worldwide. We're looking forward to device announcements in the second half of 2023. In automotive, we hosted our first Automotive Summit in Suzhou, China, with more than 1,000 automotive OEMs, Tier 1s, ecosystem partners, media, analysts, and government officials in attendance. The broad participation at the event demonstrates Qualcomm's strong position as a technology partner to the growing automotive ecosystem worldwide, especially EVs as well as Snapdragon digital chassis technology and product leadership. We also won more than 10 new designs with leading automakers across the globe for next-generation digital cockpit and telematics systems. In Consumer IoT, the recently announced Meta Quest 3 is the first virtual and mixed reality headset to be powered by a next-generation Snapdragon XR platform developed in collaboration with Meta. The Quest 3 features 2x the graphical performance, higher resolution, and a slimmer, more comfortable form factor than the Quest 2. We're also helping to drive the growing ecosystem of VR and MR developers in China. Oppo recently announced their Oppo MR Glass Developer Edition, powered by Snapdragon XR2. And in compute, our next-generation PC platform with integrated custom Orion CPUs in a significantly upgraded AI engine remains on track for commercial readiness. We look forward to sharing more information at our Snapdragon Summit in October. In networking IoT, we continue to gain momentum with WiFi 7 customer design wins. As an example, TP Link expanded its retail small and medium business lines by launching 5 new routers spanning indoor and outdoor deployment scenarios, all based on Qualcomm networking Pro WiFi 7 platforms. Lastly, we're very pleased to share that we have begun shipping our fixed wireless access solutions in support of Reliance's upcoming 5G FWA service in India. In industrial IoT, we launched a video collaboration platform suite, which provides OEMs choice and flexibility for the design and deployment of immersive video conference devices across conference rooms, healthcare settings, and at-home video calling with friends and family, enabling Windows, Android, and Linux on our platforms offers the ability to customize and deploy videoconferencing products across diverse environments. Additionally, our platforms offer industry-leading AI-based noise suppression and dynamic framing. We also launched the QCS 8550 and QCS 4490, our first software-defined IoT solutions at Hannover Messe. These solutions enable next-gen smart cameras, drones, robotics, cloud gaming, industrial handhelds, panels, point-of-sale devices, and more. Lastly, together with Arrow Electronics, we announced a strategic collaboration to accelerate edge and AI adoption to form Edge Labs, an Arrow center of excellence designed to help customers alleviate IoT development challenges while increasing adoption of edge AI across a variety. We have an update on our progress in Generative AI since the last call. We're very pleased and encouraged by the rapid acceleration of Gen AI at the edge. This presents a significant opportunity for Qualcomm across our end markets. Use cases at the edge are evolving differently than the cloud given the inherent context, immediacy, privacy, security, application reliability, and personalization capabilities available on-device. For example, in handsets, models such as Stable Diffusion and Control Net are changing user experiences for content creation and photography. Large language models embedded in the user interface can also enable enhanced virtual assistance. In personal computing, real-time copilots can bring significant enhancements to productivity and creativity, the benefits of which are well understood and very compelling for enterprises across industries. We believe the automotive industry will use some of the most advanced edge AI capabilities from large language models for personalized and curated content and services, driver and occupant monitoring, and AI virtual assistance for contextual search. ADAS and autonomy applications can be enhanced by the fusion of data from cameras and other sensors for combined real-world perception, drive path prediction, and more. We're helping enable these capabilities and expect Gen AI use cases to extend to XR, edge networking, and industrial IoT. Within the quarter, we expanded our collaborations across the ecosystem, and we are engaged with multiple hyperscalers, OEMs, and ISVs. Notably, we recently announced a collaboration with Meta on Llama 2-based AI implementations on flagship smartphones and PCs that will enable developers to create new and exciting Gen AI applications using the AI capabilities of Snapdragon platforms beginning in 2024. Together with Meta, we're working to optimize the execution of Meta's Llama 2 large language models directly on-device. We also announced a focused collaboration with Microsoft to scale AI capabilities and bring best-in-class AI experience to users across consumer, enterprise, and industrial devices. At the Microsoft Build Developer Conference, our own device, Stable Diffusion, was showcased on a Windows on Snapdragon-powered laptop. We're also working with them to enable a host of productivity-based applications with multiple large models running on the device. As part of this collaboration, our AI engine direct SDK is now available to Windows developers to easily accelerate their AI apps on Snapdragon compute platforms. This marks a significant milestone. In summary, we are uniquely positioned to help shape and capitalize on the upcoming on-device Gen AI opportunity. Our AI technology is highly differentiated with best-in-class high-performance, low-power heterogeneous computing across our CPU, GPU, and NPU. And a multibillion parameter Gen AI models run pervasively and continuously on-device; we believe our NPU's unparalleled AI processing performance and power efficiency will become a requirement. We look forward to sharing more about our Gen AI capable products at Snapdragon Summit in October. Before I turn the call over to Akash, I would like to provide an update on how we are managing our business in the current macroeconomic environment. We remain focused on executing our strategy and prioritizing capital and resource allocation on our future growth and diversification opportunities. Simultaneously, we are focused on long-term operating margin targets, all while maintaining technology leadership across wireless connectivity, high performance, low power processing, and artificial intelligence. To that end, we're taking a conservative view of the market, and we'll be proactively taking additional cost actions to ensure Qualcomm is well positioned to deliver maximum value for stockholders in an uncertain environment. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our third fiscal quarter results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $8.4 billion and EPS of $1.87, which was above the midpoint of our guidance. QTL recorded revenues of $1.2 billion and EBT margin of 66% reflecting slightly lower-than-expected global devices. QCT revenues of $7.2 billion and EBIT margin of 24% were consistent with the midpoint of our guidance. Handset revenues of $5.3 billion reflected the industry landscape we have previously outlined. IoT revenues increased 7% sequentially to $1.5 billion, driven by consumer and industrial IoT customers. We saw continued momentum in automotive for our Snapdragon digital chassis products with revenues of $434 million, a growth of 13% year-over-year. Non-GAAP operating expenses were flat sequentially at $2.2 billion. We have successfully executed on our fiscal '23 cost actions and are on track to exceed our commitment of a 5% reduction relative to fiscal '22 exit rate. During the quarter, the sale of Veoneer's active safety business to Magna was completed for net cash proceeds of $1.5 billion. Before turning to the fourth fiscal quarter guidance, I'll update you on global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units and channel inventory. We continue to estimate that calendar 23 handset units will be down at least a high single-digit percentage relative to calendar '22, reflecting the macro environment and a slower recovery in China. This forecast contemplates growth in handset units going into the holiday season. In IoT, channel inventory remains elevated due to weaker demand driven by the broader macroeconomic conditions. Since it remains difficult to predict the timing of a sustained recovery and customers remain cautious with purchases, we continue to operate under the assumption that inventory drawdown dynamics will be a factor through the end of the calendar year. Turning to guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.80 to $2. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.15 billion to $1.35 billion and EBT margins of 64% to 68%, driven by a slight sequential increase in global handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $6.9 billion to $7.5 billion and EBT margins of 24% to 26%. This forecast is consistent with our prior guidance of muted seasonality in QCT revenues primarily due to the timing of purchases by a modem-only handset customer. On a sequential basis, we are forecasting Android handset revenues to be roughly flat with mid-single-digit declines in IoT and low double-digit growth in automotive. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately flat relative to the third quarter. As we approach fiscal '24, our revenue growth will largely depend on macroeconomic environment, global handset units, and the China recovery. In the first fiscal quarter, we expect 2 drivers of sequential revenue growth: QTL seasonality and handset launch by a modem-only customer. In addition, we expect a sequential decline in IoT and automotive revenues, consistent with the seasonal trend we've seen in the last couple of years. As you will recall, we had previously communicated we would evaluate additional cost actions as the environment continues to evolve. Until we see sustained signs of improving fundamentals, our operating framework does not assume an immediate recovery. Given our commitment to operating discipline, we will proactively implement additional cost actions in the first half of fiscal '24. This will be incremental to the reductions we have successfully completed in fiscal '23. Despite these actions, we will preserve investments in our strategic priorities and position ourselves to emerge stronger as the recovery from the broader industry begins to take hold. In closing, we remain focused on executing on our vision to bring connectivity, high-performance, low-power computing, and on-device generative AI to the edge. Our guiding principles remain the same: prioritize technology leadership, accelerate diversification, and drive earnings growth to create value for our stockholders.

So I wanted to double-click on a few. Maybe you could recap for us just the trends you expect in handsets versus IoT and auto that you gave. And in particular, you talked about some seasonality being better in the fourth calendar quarter in the handset market, but that inventory burn was still going to be part of the dynamic. So if you could talk through that in a little bit more detail, what kind of magnitude are you expecting for the industry in the fourth quarter? What's built into your estimates? And is the inventory burn just an Android dynamic? Or do you think that the pre-purchases from Cupertino are still an effect in the December quarter?",

Our forecast does assume sequential growth into the December quarter as we go into the holiday season. From a financial perspective, consistent with historical years, we typically have 2 significant drivers of growth going into December from September. First is QTL, and we expect to see that growth as the market grows as well. And then second is handset launched by a modem-only customer. Off of the base we have in September, we expect to see that growth as well. So those would be the 2 significant growth drivers into the quarter. From an IoT and automotive perspective, if you look at the last couple of years, we've seen a trend of a slight decline in both areas quarter-over-quarter from September to December. So we just think the same seasonality will play out; not something that goes beyond that. It's just a normal timing that we've seen in the market in the past. Maybe the last comment I'll say is our forecast for the September and December quarter does assume no material revenues from Huawei. As you are aware, we have a 4G license for shipping into Huawei. We do not have a 5G license, and we are not assuming any material revenue going forward. So hopefully, that covers all the different parts.",

However, we were pleased with our results for the June quarter, reporting an approximate 7% increase in revenue, driven by growth in both industrial and consumer sectors.

Everything that is real-time AI, always-on AI, context, latency, reliability, personalization. And I think that can apply to products across all of our end markets. When it will happen, we are going to announce a new set of products at the Snapdragon Tech Summit that are all going to be Gen AI-capable products that will be on phones, on computing products, and on all of the other segments in auto and IoT. We think the monetization will happen 2 ways, right? The easiest way to think about it is if our customers and our partners that are working with us. We mentioned a few in the prepared remarks, come up with the new use cases and you have an AI-capable smartphone, that changes the size of the phone market. It could create an upgrade cycle between 5G and 6G and change the size of the market, also improve the mix towards our product lines and ASP increases. For you to do device, Gen AI on device, you need a different computing platform. And that's what we have been doing with our NPU. I think it's probably unmatched by any of our peers in the ability to do high-performance AI pervasively and continuously at low power.

For Android, there hasn\u2019t been any significant change in market share among competitors in recent months. However, when we compare our total sell-through share for 2023 to 2022, we have actually gained share within the Android market. This indicates that we maintain a strong position, and the seasonal fluctuations we see are tied to the timing of device launches and which market segments we target, particularly the premium and high-tier segments around the holiday season versus mid-year. Regarding Apple, as I mentioned before, we anticipate lower seasonal fluctuations in the fourth quarter due to when chipset purchases are made. Earlier in the year, Apple acquired additional chipsets, and we're now forecasting expected demand and shipments for the next quarter. This issue is more about timing rather than a fundamental market trend. We expect to hold a majority share in the upcoming launch, so it's not really a question of market share.",

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q4, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $8.7 billion, and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.02 above the high-end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $7.4 billion reflect a more stable Android handset environment. Licensing business revenues were $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our leading technology and product road maps while improving operational efficiency. We remain fully focused on our future growth and diversification opportunities. Let me now discuss key highlights from the business. As we enter the age of generative AI, we're seeing an unprecedented pace of innovation. On-device Gen AI is evolving in parallel with Gen AI in the cloud enabling entirely new use cases. It has the potential to change how we interact with our devices making the user experience more natural intuitive, relevant and personal with increased immediacy, privacy and security. We have quickly established Qualcomm as a leader in on-device Gen AI for smartphones, next generation laptops, XR and automotive, and we are well-positioned to benefit from this opportunity. We expect high performance on-device AI to become a requirement over the next few years, driving content, units, or both. Our Snapdragon platform is highly differentiated from its competitors. First, we significantly increased the AI processing performance in power efficiency of our best-in-class NPU, CPU and GPU. Second, we are collaborating with multiple partners in ecosystems to enable a host of consumer and productivity-based AI models running natively on our platform. Third, we're enabling multibillion parameter Gen AI models to run continuously and concurrently for multiple use cases, including multimodal. For example, in the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 smartphone platform, state-of-the-art large language models, such as Llama and Vicuna with up to 10 billion parameters are running at up to 20 tokens per second. And large vision models such as stable diffusion can generate images from text in less than one second with ultra-low power consumption. As always, running on-device Gen AI becomes pervasive; we believe it will create one of the most significant changes in user experience similar to the transition from the feature phone to the smartphone and the introduction of the graphical user interface for PCs. Snapdragon will play a significant role in this transformation. We also reached an important milestone in our expansion into PCs with the announcement of our Snapdragon X Elite platform. It is the result of a relentless pursuit to create the ultimate intelligent computing experience and establish Snapdragon as the industry leader in performance and power efficiency. The Snapdragon X Elite includes our first implementation of the custom Oryon CPU, which exceeds the multi-threaded CPU performance of any x86 or ARM competitor in its class. It also matches the single-threaded CPU peak performance of the leading x86 CPU competitors at 70% less power. Additionally, our premium integrated Adreno GPU delivers up to two times faster performance than the competition at ISO power or matches competitor peak PC performance at 74% less power. Snapdragon X Elite also features our newest Hexagon NPU. With 45 tops of performance, the Hexagon NPU is capable of running Gen AI models with over 13 billion parameters on-device. In total AI performance of the Snapdragon X Elite across CPU, GPU and NPU is 75 tops, the highest in the industry. Microsoft is redefining the entire Windows experience with the AI Copilot and the Snapdragon X Elite is built from the ground up for this opportunity. We look forward to PCs powered by Snapdragon X Elite from leading OEMs starting mid-2024. The merging of physical and digital spaces remains a significant future opportunity for Qualcomm and we recently launched a Snapdragon AR1 platform, our first dedicated platform for smart glasses. AR1 Gen 1 was developed in close collaboration with Meta and powers the new Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. It features a dual ISP camera system for premium photos and videos as well as powerful on-device AI for image enhancement, virtual assistance, real-time translation, visual search, and more. Together with Meta, we're developing next-generation technologies to create the future of spatial computing. The AR1 Gen 1 along with a previously announced Snapdragon XR Gen 2 are a testament to the strength of this long-standing partnership. Across the industry, Snapdragon remains the platform of choice for all leading VR, MR and AR designs. In networking, we continue to be a global Wi-Fi leader across enterprise and home networks as well as broadband gateways. Our Wi-Fi 7 solutions are seeing strong traction with more than 350 design wins across all categories to date. We recently announced several new collaborations, including with Charter Communications in the U.S. and EE in the UK, both of which are preparing to roll out enhanced next-generation Wi-Fi 7 connectivity to the residential and small and medium-size business customers. We're excited about the launch of our Fiber Gateway Platform which adds 10 gigabit passive optical network capabilities to our portfolio. With Fiber, in addition to 5G and Wi-Fi 7, we're now positioned to lead in next-generation broadband solutions. Additionally, our unique service-defined Wi-Fi technology signature feature introduced with our Wi-Fi platforms offers a unified data flow management architecture from cloud to device. It delivers orchestration, classification, scheduling, and insights to enable the end-to-end management of home networks in real-time optimizations across devices. In automotive, the digital transformation of the industry continues to bring new levels of computing, intelligence, and cloud connectivity to the vehicle. These trends are driving new user experiences, advancements in driver assistance, autonomy, and safety. They also offer the potential for new revenue opportunities as vehicles gain the ability to evolve with over-the-air updates in digital services. The vehicle is becoming software defined and the Snapdragon Digital Chassis remains at the center of this transformation. We are pleased that our Digital Chassis solutions will bring advanced capabilities to the upcoming Cadillac Escalade IQ, which is planned for commercial production in 2024. The Cadillac Escalade IQ will be equipped with the Snapdragon Cockpit, Snapdragon Auto Connectivity, and Snapdragon Ride platforms. Additionally, we're proud of our partnership with BMW for all vehicles as well as the upcoming Neue Klasse. We're also excited that the Snapdragon Digital Cockpit and Connectivity solutions now powered the new Mercedes-Benz User Experience starting with the 2024 E-Class sedan. We recently expanded our Digital Chassis offering with the launch of two new platforms for two-wheelers and other vehicle classes such as motorcycles, e-bikes, scooters, and all-terrain vehicles. Our new platform design wins and launches with Gogoro, Harley-Davidson, and others are receiving positive feedback from the ecosystem on their ability to advance technology development and bring new user experiences to these vehicles. Finally, we announced a new long-term relationship with Amazon Web Services to enable automakers to integrate cloud technologies into their vehicle development lifecycle. The offering combines the Qualcomm Cloud AI 100 solution, our Snapdragon Ride platforms, as well as AWS breadth of services and capabilities. This will advance the future of software-defined mobility and change how vehicles are designed and developed. In handsets, we announced our latest premium mobile platform the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which delivers industry-leading performance and extraordinary experiences to consumers for the upcoming Gen AI era. Some key features include intelligent capture with the world's smartest AI-powered camera, console-level gaming with ray tracing with global illumination, studio-quality audio, the world's first XSPAN technology, best-in-class connectivity, and the world's fastest on-device AI processing on a smartphone. We look forward to flagship device launches powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 by global OEMs and smartphone brands, including Xiaomi, Honor, OPPO, Vivo, OnePlus, Sony, and more. In addition, we recently entered into an agreement with Apple to apply Snapdragon 5G Modem-RF systems for smartphone launches in 2024, 2025, and 2026. This agreement reinforces our track record of sustained leadership across 5G technologies and products. We are proud of our ongoing relationship with Apple. As we look forward, our technology roadmap has never been stronger and the fundamentals of Qualcomm's growth drivers remain unchanged with significant opportunities in the coming years. We continue to focus on stockholder returns in executing on our ongoing diversification opportunities while maintaining operating discipline. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with our fourth fiscal quarter results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $8.7 billion and EPS of $2.02, which is above the high end of our guidance. QTL revenues of $1.3 billion and EBT margin of 66% were in line with our expectations. QCT delivered revenues of $7.4 billion, an EBT margin of 26%, which were near the high end of our guidance on strength in handset and automotive revenues. Handset revenues of $5.5 billion increased 4% sequentially and were higher than expectations due to the benefit from the early stages of recovery in Android demand. IoT revenues of $1.4 billion were down 7% quarter-over-quarter, including softness in industrial IoT demand. Automotive revenue grew 23% sequentially to $535 million, making this the 12th consecutive quarter of double-digit percentage growth on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% sequentially to $2.2 billion. Before turning to guidance, I'll summarize our fiscal '23 results. We delivered non-GAAP revenues of $36 billion and EPS of $8.43 despite the challenging macro environment. We remain focused on our strategic priorities of extending technology leadership and driving revenue diversification while taking significant steps to improve our operating efficiency. We continued our strong momentum in automotive and delivered record revenues of $1.9 billion, with year-over-year growth of 24%, progressing towards our target of greater than $4 billion in revenue by 2026. We exceeded our fiscal '23 cost action target, reducing non-GAAP operating expenses by 7% relative to the fiscal '22 exit rate, executing on our commitment to manage the cost structure given the current operating environment. Our business continues to generate strong free cash flow, with a record of $9.8 billion. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong with $11.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Now, turning to guidance. We are seeing early signs of stabilization in demand for global 3G, 4G, and 5G handsets. We now estimate that calendar '23 handsets will be down mid-to-high single-digit percentage relative to calendar '22, an improvement from our prior expectations. In the first fiscal quarter of '24, we are forecasting revenues of $9.1 billion to $9.9 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.25 to $2.45. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and EBT margins of 70% to 74% with sequential growth driven by an increase in global handset units for the holiday season. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.7 billion to $8.3 billion and EBT margins of 26% to 28%. On a sequential basis, we estimate double-digit percentage growth for QCT handset revenues and anticipate both IoT and automotive revenues to decline consistent with last year. QCT handset revenue forecast includes the benefit of normalization of Android channel inventory and higher demand due to the acceleration of flagship launches with our newly announced Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform. Notably, QCT handset forecast includes sequential revenue growth of greater than 35% from Chinese OEMs. QCT IoT revenue forecast reflects the industry-wide cyclical factors we've previously discussed, including lower demand and elevated channel inventory. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be flat relative to the fourth fiscal quarter. As we enter fiscal '24, we are encouraged by the early signs of demand stabilization in handsets and our strong competitive positioning across revenue streams. Key industry trends such as heterogeneous mobile computing and on-device generative AI provide a strong foundation for content growth and expansion to new device categories, driving growth opportunities for Qualcomm. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication and for remaining focused on execution and continuing to deliver industry-leading products.

So, as you look over the next sort of 12 to 18 months, what should investors look at in terms of more validation of either wins or revenues that you expect from the monetization of the trend, in relation to what investors can really look to as milestones to validate that this is actually going to be sort of playing out over the next three to four years.

For those that have not seen, I think I would recommend checking the highlights of our Snapdragon Tech Summit that just happened a couple of weeks ago when we announced the results of our investments in Gen AI. I'll tell you Samik that on-device Gen AI, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, is evolving in parallel to the cloud. And it's going to have a significant impact in how you change the user experience. Just think about a simple use case as you're texting; every single text that you write could be an input to a model, and that could bring prediction of your behavior and bring other applications. We demonstrated a number of use cases that are under development by many other OEMs. There are a number of different models from large language models to large visual models. One unique position of Qualcomm is we have many of those models running natively on a platform. We're creating a model zoo for Snapdragon. And you saw announcements from Microsoft, from Meta, and from what we're doing on Android, as well as with our Chinese partners. And you're going to start to see those signs, especially what flagship devices are launching in '24, as you start to see those use cases changing photography, changing messaging, changing scheduling, changing assistance, how you should think about this financially for us. You have the potential to create a new cycle for phones, and it will have an impact on increased silicon content. Just to put in perspective, we have significantly increased the processing performance of our AI processing in the device; our NPU is going to impact silicon content, is going to have an impact on mix, and it's going to have an impact on unit of all of it. And it's likely going to start as use cases get developed with flagships launching in '24, but it could be very significant as you look at the next two to three years.",

I think investors at the same time are grappling with the potential sort of puts and takes, particularly when it comes to your primary or a large Android customer, Samsung, using more in-house solutions going forward. So, when we think about seasonality beyond the December quarter, particularly around the launch periods, how should we think about your market share with Samsung progressing and what impact does that have on relative to your typical seasonality from December to March?

I think the first part of the conversation, as we said in the prepared remarks, we're happy that the inventory dynamics that we have seen within the Android business are largely behind us right now. And, one data point that we provided in a cautious remark is sequentially from Q4 fiscal to our guide, we're seeing a total growth of revenue from Chinese OEMs, both in China and outside China of 35%. And I think that shows that our customers are in a great position, even facing new interests in the market. And, it's also the strength of our roadmap and the stabilization of the market. The second question is about Samsung. Look, we're happy with our partnership with Samsung. There's the upcoming launch of the GS24. We expect to have the majority share. Our product is really great. I think as I said, we probably have one of the best product roadmaps in the history of the company, especially in the Gen AI processing capabilities. And the product is getting better. We were happy to talk about what we have done in PC with our new Oryon CPU. That CPU is coming to mobile especially in '25, and we expect even more evolution of Gen AI. So the roadmap gets better over time. Overall, we're positive about our relationship with Samsung. Thank you.",

I guess for my first question, Cristiano, I did pick up on the 35% growth sequentially with China OEMs. But you guys, the question I've been getting a ton is around Huawei and what they're doing. So, you guys called out, I think, last quarter that they were going to be getting some supply on seven nanometer from SMIC and being able to do some devices themselves. And you called out an impact to your revenue. But I think longer term into all of next calendar year, there's some expectation that they might get some more supply, some of it from SMIC on seven, some of it from SMIC on 16. And that might be a unit headwind to some of your other OEM customers. Maybe you can unpack a little bit of what's going on with Huawei and how you see it impacting the market in China that would be helpful. And I have a follow-up. Thanks.",

I think maybe separate and first, as we indicated in the last earnings call, we indicated that we don't have any more projection of selling our 4G SOCs to Huawei. And going forward, we don't expect to have any significance; it's going to be a very small contribution from Huawei. I think the more interesting answer to your question, and that's the reason I provide the 35% data point, is as Huawei launched the device, we are seeing continuous growth from our customers on the Android side. We see a mix improvement from our customers moving towards flagship, and it's reflected in our numbers. So it does not change the trajectory that we have with our Android customers in China. And there is a possibility that I think that Huawei is upgrading their existing customer base. You know there was a data point, there are about 100 million Huawei former customers with a four to five-year-old Huawei phone, and that could have an impact on increasing the TAM.",

I guess what I'm trying to understand a little bit more is support for ARM PCs, whether in gaming or in enterprise use cases, by other ISVs. So folks that might need to use other applications that wouldn't be touched directly by Qualcomm or directly by Microsoft. Cristiano, could you give us a little bit of an update there? What are you seeing from the ISV ecosystem and in what parts of the PC market do you see potential momentum for your products? Thanks.",

          "content": "Look, there's a lot to unpack here. I can speak about this for a whole day, but I'm going to try to be succinct. First thing, we're incredibly proud of the accomplishments of our team. I think Snapdragon X Elite took the leadership position in this space for any mobile computing device. We're incredibly happy with the performance of the new CPU, both single-threaded and multi-threaded performance. But not only that, I think it's important to highlight the AI processing capability because that's key to answer your question. If you look, versus announcements on NPU or some of the other ARM competitors, we had 45 tops performance on the NPU with a total tops performance on X Elite of 75. And that aligns with the transition that Microsoft is making towards a Windows AI future, especially the new services with the Copilot and everything we're doing with Microsoft, on-device working together on-device AI with the cloud and with the Azure endpoint. We're excited about that. And you should start thinking about the PC business, almost like the auto business. We're focused on next-generation PCs, not existing PCs, and as those windows started to switch to Windows AI and our platform launches, it creates opportunities for us to start gaining scale. Specifically to your question, Microsoft has been very active together with us in bringing a lot of applications natively through the platform. I think we made significant progress across consumer and commercial applications. You continue to see announcements and Windows 11 can also run every x86, 32, and 64 bit to the Microsoft emulation. We also made significant strides in the emulation performance. So, I think Snapdragon X Elite represents the results of this Microsoft Qualcomm collaboration. And I'll finish the answer by saying, if you look at the announcements of other computing companies talking about having an ARM based PC preprocessor, that is validation that that's our TAM now. It is going to be part of the expansion of TAM for Qualcomm. We're a new player and we look at this as a growth opportunity. We\u2019re excited about it.",

And Akash, can you just give us some of the puts and takes on that March quarter seasonality? I mean, we've got a strong Apple quarter presumably in December that rolls off. We've got Samsung that launches, although we can question what the share is. We've got other things going on. Just how do we think about that seasonality in the context of everything that's going on, which we'll be expecting?",

I mean, we do expect the first quarter and the fourth quarter to be the strongest quarters within the year. And then the third quarter, as you know, is typically the lower quarter because we don't have a flagship phone launch that happens during the quarter. But when you step back and kind of look at, as we enter fiscal 2024, we're very happy with kind of the early signs of stabilization in the global handset market. And so we are cautiously optimistic as we go forward with that stabilization and the normalization of Android channel inventory. We are on a strong trajectory as we go through the year.",

You're modeling 20% share now in the phone that launches in '26. So that'll be primarily a fiscal '27 issue. How should we think about the shape of that in '24 and the launches that happened in '24 and '25? Do we assume that you've got close to 100% of the majority of the units there and then it drops down for modeling purposes to 20% on the '26 launch or like, what does that look like?",

For financial planning purposes, we're taking the same approach as we did with the last agreement, and that's 20% you mentioned, where in the last year, we are planning as if we're going to get 20% share.

So, the financial guidance we gave is that the year-over-quarter trend from September quarter to the December quarter in automotive and IoT will be consistent with last year. So if you look at last year, automotive was down, I think, 1% or 2%. And so we're guiding effectively down 1% or 2% or flat for automotive. We obviously had a very strong quarter in the September quarter. The business traction continues to accelerate for us. The product roadmap is great. As Cristiano outlined in his prepared remarks, the relationship with the customers was very strong as well. So, we continue to be optimistic and we're well on our way to execute on the financial targets we have given long-term. From an IoT perspective, again, the same guidance that it's consistent with last year, what the trend we saw between the September December quarter. And really when you think about IoT, we're seeing some of the same factors that other players in the industry are seeing, some demand weakness coupled with channel inventory. As we look forward, we think our first quarter is the bottom for the year for IoT. We expect to strengthen from that point on, and especially as we get into the second half of the fiscal year, with the environment normalizing, but then also with increasingly strong traction for our products. We think we'll have a strong second half in IoT.",

I just wondered, what does that mean to the gross margin within QCT? It seems like it opens up new TAMs on the unit side.

As we scale in markets like automotive and certain segments of IoT, such as PCs and XR, we have the opportunity to improve our operating margin efficiency due to highly leveraged R&D, particularly in computing and connectivity. As we achieve scale, we will likely see positive effects on our margins. Regarding IoT, it's important to recognize that not all IoT segments are the same, and we have various initiatives within IoT. There are existing businesses affected by inventory dynamics, but also new growth opportunities. PCs will play a significant role, particularly in fiscal '25, with devices like the X Elite launching in the latter half of '24. XR is still in its early stages, but we are now equipped to expand in networking with Fiber, and with 5G and Wi-Fi 7 being advantageous. We also see potential for edge processing in the IoT space. These new areas are less affected by the cyclical dynamics affecting our existing business. Thank you.",

And for calendar 2023, we now expect mid to high single digits versus 2022, which is an improvement from what we had before. As we look at 2024, the recent demand stabilization obviously provides a positive setup as we go into the year. So we are cautiously optimistic on how 2024 plays out. But specifically on 5G units, which is really our target market, we expect high single-digit to low double-digit growth from 2023 into 2024. So that's kind of the market that we pursue, and we think there's growth opportunity there going into next year. From an ASP perspective, because of all the factors we discussed earlier in the call with the chips becoming way more capable, especially with GenAI, we think we are on a good trajectory to continue to expand our ASP consistent with the last three-year trend. So if you look at our last three-year trend, we've added approximately 10% increase in any tier of chipset every year.

The European Union right now is in what they call a trialogue process. It's going to take a while to get through; parliament and member states are going to weigh in. The commission's going to weigh in. The European Patent Office is actually opposed to parts of the regulation. Ericsson and Nokia, of course, weighing in as well. So this is going to be a fairly messy legislative process that will take some number of years to sort out. It's being followed in other jurisdictions. We're following it here in the US. The US Patent Trademark Office has weighed in somewhat negatively I think. And it's being followed in China as well. So this will kind of play out over some years.

In terms of breaking down the revenue growth in QCT, between inventory and market, obviously, it's kind of difficult to do over a quarter. But we do think that inventory is a big part of it.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q1, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.9 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.75, above the high end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $8.4 billion reflect healthy Android demand and continued strong momentum in automotive. Licensing business revenues were $1.5 billion. We're pleased with these results, and I will now share some key highlights from the business. In handsets, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform is setting a new standard for on-device generative AI experiences for premium smartphones and powers all flagship Android devices launched and launching this fiscal year. Notably, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform for Galaxy is featured in the recently announced Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra globally, in addition to the Galaxy S24 and S24 Plus in multiple regions. The Galaxy S24 Series includes on-device AI features such as live translation, interpreter, chat assist, nitography and more. This marks the beginning of how generative AI will evolve the overall smartphone experience and highlights the significant opportunity for Snapdragon platforms. We're also announcing that we extended a multiyear agreement with Samsung relating to Snapdragon platforms for flagship Galaxy smartphone launches starting in 2024. The extended agreement demonstrates the value of Snapdragon 8, our technology leadership and our successful long-term strategic partnership with Samsung. In the quarter, we also announced the Snapdragon 7 Gen 3 mobile platform, which brings leading generative AI capabilities to high-tier Android smartphones and is a category leader in both experiences and performance. In our QTL business, we're pleased to share that we recently extended several key license agreements. First, Apple exercised its unilateral option to extend its global patent license agreement for an additional two years, taking the existing agreement through March 2027; second, we have renewed long-term agreements with two significant Chinese smartphone OEMs. In addition, we continue to negotiate new agreements or renewals with other key licensees and OEMs, including some whose current agreements are set to expire in early fiscal 2025. Automotive continues to be an important pillar of our growth and diversification strategy. Notably, 75 new models launched commercially in 2023 were for technologies, highlighting Qualcomm's growing scale in automotive and execution of our design wins. Earlier this month at CES, we announced our collaboration with Bosch to have our Snapdragon Ride Flex SoC power their new central vehicle computer. As a reminder, Snapdragon Ride Flex enables the fusion of infotainment and ADAS functionalities on a single SoC, enabling automakers to realize a unified central-compute and software-defined vehicle architecture that scales across tiers. Additionally, we demonstrated digital cockpits connected services and advanced driver systems enabled by generative AI models running locally on the Snapdragon platform. These new capabilities can be enabled on several existing designs via a software upgrade. This represents significant new opportunities for Qualcomm and our partners. In PCs, we're driving towards the launch of Snapdragon X Elite in mid-2024 and are pleased that our design win traction continues to increase since the platform was announced last October. We expect Snapdragon X Elite to set the industry benchmark for on-device generative AI and copilot experiences in addition to leading performance and battery life for next-generation Windows PCs. We recently expanded our mixed reality solutions with the announcement of the Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2. Our new platform supports 4.3k per eye resolution and 90 frames per second in 12 or more concurrent cameras to deliver crisp immersive mixed reality and virtual reality experiences. We are proud to partner with Samsung and Google to provide leading XR experiences to Galaxy users by utilizing Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2. In edge networking, we announced the Snapdragon X35 5G Modern-RF system, the world's first commercial Release 17 5G RedCap solution. The Snapdragon X35 brings a new class of purpose-built 5G for Internet of Things devices. Devices powered by Snapdragon X35 are expected to launch in the first half of 2024. We continue to believe that industrial edge devices with connectivity, high-performance computing, and on-device AI will become one of our largest addressable opportunities fueled by secular trends of digital transformation. As such, we're accelerating our investments in solutions, ecosystems, and broad channel enablement to position ourselves for growth while we navigate the industry-wide inventory drawdown. One key area of focus is to enable our customers to unlock the potential of generative AI at the enterprise using our chipset solutions. As an example, Zebra Technologies and Toshiba recently demonstrated on-device generative AI capabilities for enterprise workflows and inventory management at retail self-checkout, respectively. Additionally, Honeywell showcased a Qualcomm-powered edge AI box for warehouse applications. As we complete the first quarter of fiscal '24, ahead of our expectations, I'm very optimistic about Qualcomm's trajectory and the opportunities ahead. The fundamentals of our growth drivers remain unchanged, our diversification strategy is working, and we're making significant progress across mobile, automotive, computing, XR, edge networking, industrial IoT and more. At the upcoming Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, we will provide an update on our cellular modem and connectivity leadership as well as on our overall scale of Snapdragon generative AI.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our first fiscal quarter earnings. We are pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results above the high end of guidance with revenues of $9.9 billion and EPS of $2.75. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 74% were at the high end of guidance, reflecting slightly higher handset units. QCT delivered revenues of $8.4 billion and EBT margin of 31%, both above the high end of guidance, reflecting strength in handsets and automotive revenues. QCT EBT margin includes the benefit of revenue scale, stronger product mix, and operating discipline. Handset revenues of $6.7 billion were higher than our prior expectations primarily due to the increased demand driven by the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 mobile platform. Notably, our Android handset revenues from Chinese OEMs exceeded our expectations of greater than 35% sequential growth. IoT revenues of $1.1 billion reflect the industry-wide challenges we've previously outlined. We achieved record automotive revenues of $598 million which grew by 12% sequentially, reflecting the increased content in new vehicle launches with our Snapdragon digital chassis platform. Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 5% sequentially to $2.1 billion and included the benefit of accelerated implementation of cost actions that we had previously outlined for the first half of fiscal '24. Lastly, we returned $1.7 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $784 million in stock repurchases and $895 million in dividends. Before turning to second fiscal quarter guidance, I'll update you on global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units. We estimate that global units declined by mid-single digit percentage in calendar '23 relative to calendar '22, an improvement from our prior expectations due to the recent stabilization in demand. For calendar '24, we estimate that global handset units will be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. This estimate includes expected growth of high-single digit to low double-digit percentage in 5G handsets. Turning to guidance for the second fiscal quarter. We are forecasting revenues of $8.9 billion to $9.7 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.20 to $2.40. The sequential decline in revenues and non-GAAP EPS relative to the first fiscal quarter will be driven by seasonality for a modem-only handset customer in both QTL and QCT. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.6 billion to $8.2 billion and EBT margins of 27% to 29%. For QCT handset revenues coming off strong performance in the first fiscal quarter, we anticipate Android revenues will be approximately flat quarter-over-quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect QCT IoT revenues to grow by mid to high-single digit percentage with QCT automotive revenues slightly down, consistent with the trend in the prior year. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses of approximately $2.2 billion. This reflects typical calendar year resets for certain employee-related costs. In closing, we're very pleased to start our fiscal year with strong execution and financial performance. In QTL, as Cristiano outlined, we are pleased to have extended several key license agreements. We do not expect any material change in QTL licensing revenue run rate as a result of these extensions. In QCT, our technology differentiation will accelerate with our on-device generative AI leadership and introduction of our custom Qualcomm Orion CPU. We also remain well positioned to execute on our diversification strategy by extending our technology portfolio to deliver industry-leading products across automotive and IoT.",

It's not only unique to the Galaxy S24, that has a number of now use cases running generative AI on the device. I mentioned a few in my prepared remarks like translation and you have a much more effective assistance in a number of different applications. We're going to see productivity coming. But we'll also see that happening with some of our other customers from China, launching a number of models. So I think we have a large number now of models being ported into our hardware for generative AI. I think we're starting to see the beginning of new use cases. Reviews have been positive, and we are happy with what we've seen following the launch. I think we need to monitor the situation. But eventually, at a minimum, it's going to have a favorable impact on the mix, which is a trend that we continue to see premium and high tier with more computing power as the fastest-growing segment in the handset market.",

And so as we go through the year, we typically see a normal bill bleed cycle around handset launches. So that\u2019s kind of the phase we are in from our perspective. In the first quarter, what we saw was higher demand due to the acceleration of Android flagship launches with our new chip, Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. And we saw very strong demand across all the major Android OEMs. And so we're happy, of course, with that traction, and that momentum carries over to the second quarter as well. And that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing both in our results and our guide going forward. In terms of your comment on Huawei, really what we\u2019ve seen since the Huawei 5G launch is that the premium tier total addressable market in China has expanded.

So maybe you could give us a little context as to the length and any details you can share on the new agreement. You guys obviously have your new custom CPUs coming into the Snapdragon roadmap and some expanded MPU product as well.

Most importantly, our roadmap is strengthening over time, particularly with our custom CPU entering mobile, and we aim to lead in mobile CPU performance.

And I noticed that even with the IoT business down dramatically, there was some improvement in sequential gross margin in the quarter and back above 30% in QCT operating margins. So maybe you could discuss some of the moving parts with margins in the business because it was pleasantly a bit better than I had modeled, and I kind of want to see what might be sustainable or what actions you took on a go-forward basis on both the gross and the operating side.

And of course, I'll continue to remain committed to my CFO role, working closely with the team here and maintaining consistency and transparency and looking forward to seeing a lot of you at upcoming events. On the margin side, what you saw in the first quarter is really the fact that our gross margins were stronger because the mix was richer. We had a higher set of premium tier launches coming through, and that impacted our volume, and we benefited from that richer mix. If you look at our second quarter guidance, we are guiding largely in line with how our first quarter came in. From an operating margin perspective, it's in addition to the strength in the gross margins, obviously, the revenue scale and the actions we took on operating expenses also benefited. So we were happy to deliver a 31% operating margin in QCT and really focused on delivering the long-term target we\u2019ve outlined to the investors.",

Consistent with our previous comments, we think the first quarter was the bottom for our IoT revenue stream. We're guiding second quarter up mid to high-single digits. In the second half of the fiscal year, as we see the inventory channel normalizing and end markets benefiting from that, we're excited about what our product portfolio can bring overall, lots of opportunities for us.

What we're excited about is that since we announced at the Tech Summit showing the performance of the product and the AI capabilities, design traction continues to increase. So we had increased the number of designs since last quarter, and we continue to march forward towards the launch. We like that everybody is now talking about on-device AI on PC.

With the recent launch of the Galaxy S24, and in line with our previous statements, we expect to secure a majority share based on the model distribution between us and Samsung. As Cristiano mentioned earlier, the agreement with Samsung provides us with predictability regarding our standing in the premium tier moving forward. There's notably an expansion of content happening; looking at our roadmap for the premium tier, we are integrating not only generative AI and custom CPU cores, but also advancing in other technologies. As consumer demand for enhanced capabilities increases, we anticipate our content offerings and average selling price will continue to rise.  Regarding your second question on our automotive business, it's important to view this area as being closely linked to the introduction of new vehicles. The industry is undergoing a transformation with the digitization of cars, and we are positioned right at the center of this change. Our growth is linked to the increasing infotainment capabilities and advanced driver-assistance systems being incorporated into new vehicles. Consequently, we are seeing a rise in content as new car models are rolled out. This creates a difference between our performance and that of some competitors. Overall, while the industry faces some short-term dynamics that we are keeping a close eye on, our technology, position, and product offerings look very promising, and we are enthusiastic about our future prospects.",

Both our Apple and Samsung revenue on the chip side are under contract. We're very happy about that. We continue to move towards stability of the QTL revenue stream with those new agreements. As you look at the growth opportunity, I think the auto results speak for itself. We're now in the IoT segment, really focused on the launch of X Elite. In the PC, we announced a new product for XR. If you believe that, that market is finally going to get very large scale, we're well positioned with our partnership with Meta as well as Samsung and Google. As IoT, especially industrial, goes through a correction, we expect that to resume growth. So we're focused on what we can control, busy working with the growth and diversification of the company.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q2, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.4 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.44 was above the high end of our guidance. Revenues from our chipset business of $8 billion reflect strong premium tier demand for Android smartphones and continued momentum in automotive. Licensing business revenues were $1.3 billion. During the quarter, we also made significant progress on our leading technology and product road maps as well as executing on our growth and diversification opportunities. Let me share some key highlights from the business. As we drive intelligent computing everywhere, we're enabling the ecosystem to develop and commercialize on-device GenAI applications across smartphones, next-generation PCs, XR devices, vehicles, industrial edge, robotics, networking, and more. To that end, we recently launched the Qualcomm AI Hub, a gateway for developers to enable the large-scale commercialization of on-device AI applications. It features a library of approximately 100 pre-optimized AI models for devices powered by Snapdragon and Qualcomm platforms, delivering four times faster inferencing compared to non-optimized models. As AI expands rapidly from the cloud to devices, we are extremely well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity, given our leadership position at the edge across technologies, including on-device AI. In automotive, the Snapdragon Digital Chassis is the industry's leading technology solution, and we're pleased to announce that our design win pipeline has increased to approximately $45 billion. We're growing faster than the addressable market and remain on track to achieve more than $4 billion of automotive revenues in fiscal '26. In premium and high-tier smartphones, our Snapdragon mobile platforms continue to set the bar for performance and on-device GenAI capabilities. Recently launched flagship Android devices powered by Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 are seeing strong demand globally, especially in China. We are extending the most sought-after 8 Series capabilities, including on-device AI to a broader range of flagship and high-tier smartphones with the new Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 and Snapdragon 7 Plus Gen 3 mobile platforms launching in the second half of 2024. In cellular modems, we have again established a new industry benchmark with the Snapdragon X80, the world's most advanced 5G Modem-RF System. The X80 supports 5G advanced, the next era of 5G in addition to direct-to-mobile 3GPP-compliant satellite communications and leading Release 18 features. Additionally, our networking solutions continue to gain traction as the WiFi 7 transition expands to the enterprise. We are excited about the upcoming launches of next-generation Windows AI PCs powered by Snapdragon. The Snapdragon X Elite is the leader in performance on-device AI and power efficiency for the Windows ecosystem, and is optimally positioned to lead the transition to true AI PCs. I'm also pleased to share that we recently expanded our compute portfolio with the Snapdragon X Plus platform, which is designed to address a broader range of device tiers. In XR, we're seeing good momentum in augmented and virtual reality. In particular, the Ray-Ban Meta glasses powered by our Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 platform continue to gain traction with consumers. Additionally, the Meta Horizon OS running on Snapdragon is now open and available to third-party hardware makers. This is a significant milestone as they will expand the device ecosystem. Finally, at the Embedded World Conference in Germany, we announced two new solutions for the industrial IoT ecosystem: the Qualcomm QCC730 micro-power WiFi SoC and the Qualcomm RB3 Gen 2 platform. The QCC730 is specifically designed for IoT connectivity in battery-powered, industrial, commercial, and consumer applications, featuring 88% lower power consumption than previous generations. The RB3 Gen 2 platform is a complete hardware and software solution designed for a wide range of products, including various types of robots, drones, industrial handheld devices, and more. The RB3 is supported by the recently announced AI Hub and also features support for Qualcomm Linux, a comprehensive package of operating system, software, and developer tools for our IoT platforms. In summary, we're very pleased with the continued progress on our growth and diversification strategy. Beyond handsets, we have established leadership positions across automotive, XR, and networking, and we are well positioned to do the same in PCs, industrial, and edge AI. We're optimistic about the opportunities ahead for the company and will continue to execute our plan to deliver long-term growth and value for shareholders. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our second fiscal quarter earnings. We are pleased to announce another quarter of strong non-GAAP results with revenues of $9.4 billion and EPS of $2.44, which was above the high end of our guidance range. QTL revenues of $1.3 billion and EBT margin of 71% were in line with our expectations. QCT delivered revenues of $8 billion and EBT margin of 29%, which was at the high end of our guidance range, reflecting strength across handset and automotive. QCT handset revenues of $6.2 billion included the benefit of flagship Android smartphone launches powered by our Snapdragon Gen 3 mobile platform. QCT IoT revenues increased 9% sequentially to $1.2 billion, which was slightly better than our expectations. We had another record quarter in QCT Automotive, with revenues increasing by 35% on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increased content in new vehicle launches with our Snapdragon Digital Chassis products. We returned $1.6 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $731 million in stock repurchases and $895 million in dividends. During the quarter, we also announced an increase in our quarterly dividends from $0.80 to $0.85 per share, consistent with our commitment to dividend growth. Lastly, the sale of the restraint control system business successfully completes the divestiture of the non-Arriver businesses related to our acquisition of Veoneer. We are very pleased with this acquisition, and the Arriver team is executing on the development of our computer vision and drive policy ADAS software stack, targeting vehicle launches starting in late '25. Now turning to guidance. Our forecast for global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units remains unchanged for calendar '24. We estimate that global handset units will be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. This includes expected growth of high single-digit to low double-digit percentage in 5G handsets. For the third fiscal quarter, we are forecasting revenues of $8.8 billion to $9.6 billion, and non-GAAP EPS of $2.15 to $2.35. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion and EBT margins of 69% to 73%, reflecting normal seasonality for handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $7.5 billion to $8.1 billion and EBT margins of 25% to 27%. Consistent with our previous comments, we anticipate QCT handset revenues to decline by mid-single-digit percentage sequentially, reflecting a seasonal trend due to the absence of flagship handset launches in the quarter. We expect QCT IoT revenues to grow sequentially by low to mid-single-digit percentage as we continue to see a gradual recovery from the macro factors impacting the industry. Following a record performance in the second fiscal quarter, we expect QCT Automotive revenues to grow by low double-digit percentage quarter-over-quarter as the increase in our design win pipeline continues to materialize into revenue. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.2 billion. In closing, we are pleased with our execution and financial performance for the first half of the fiscal year. Specifically, we saw year-over-year handset revenues from our Chinese OEMs increase by greater than 40% in the first half of fiscal '24, reflecting our strong competitive positioning and recovery of demand. Looking forward, our technology leadership positions us to continue to execute on our diversification strategy across IoT and automotive. In IoT, we look forward to normalization and demand across our customer base exiting fiscal '24. In addition, we're excited about the launch of our next-generation AI PCs powered by our Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus platforms from all leading PC OEMs starting in mid-'24. These PCs will deliver industry-leading processor performance, advanced on-device GenAI features, and extended battery life. In automotive, we are pleased that our design win pipeline has increased from $30 billion in September '22 to approximately $45 billion, providing confidence in executing to our long-term revenue targets.

And I wonder if that changes your potential opportunity for your modem business integrated with your RF business. There was a competitor that mentioned socket loss last night, and I think it went to you guys. I wonder if you might comment on how or why. But I think it's a bigger picture question as the compute subsystem of the phone puts pressure on the modem and RF does that give you opportunities for further integration.",

I think as far as modem-RF, we believe we have a very competitive RF front-end portfolio, and we have been really delivering unique features across the modem RF, especially on power. As a general comment, not related to AI, but as a general comment, I think as you look at RF AI running on device and AI running on the cloud, modem becomes more important, especially things like latency of response or hybrid AI models have a new importance of real-time connectivity. So we're starting to see more and more the modem becoming more important. The real advantage for Qualcomm is not only on the modem-RF, even though I think we're very proud of having the leadership position there, but the fact that we created the ability to run AI pervasively on devices without compromising battery life. And that has been reflected within our NPU performance both on phones as well as PCs and cars.

So I'm curious to understand what you're seeing on the ground there in terms of the China market. Also, it's always been sort of a leader in adopting new technology and it seems like the AI phones are doing well.

What we really like is that within that market, premium and high-tier as a percentage continue to increase, and that's actually what's driving the results. We are seeing the very first instances of on-device AI and GenAI being launched in premium devices, and that has been resonating well with the consumer. So it's a positive trend that we like. The other color I'd like to add is, we have not seen signs of weakness in the Android premium market in China, especially with our OEMs. So a lot of the strength is really coming from premium devices from Xiaomi, Honor, Oppo, OnePlus, and Vivo.

Clearly, very strong sort of pipeline of wins, but how sustainable is this sort of pace of improvement quarter-over-quarter in terms of revenue?

The updated number that we just provided is $45 billion of design wins. Obviously, a very significant increase, and of note, within that, approximately one-third is driven by ADAS.

So as you'll recall, Mike, we had said earlier that we expect the third quarter to be the low quarter from a financial perspective, just given the seasonality of our business. That still holds true. So as we go from the third to fourth quarter and then into fiscal first quarter, which is the December quarter, we expect growth as new launches of phones happen across all major OEMs. As I said earlier, we're going to have the launch of our Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip as well, and we're extremely excited about what that chip does and the launches that will come through that chip later in the year. Specifically, as you think about the fourth quarter, we expect the EPS growth from third to fourth quarter to be consistent with fiscal '23 and then we'll grow beyond that into the December quarter. Yes. So Mike, we had talked about December fiscal first quarter as the bottom quarter. We grew from that into March by 9% sequential growth, which was better than our expectations. Now we're guiding low to mid-single-digit growth into the September quarter. As we had outlined at the beginning of the year, we would see improvement through the year, and that trend is holding, and we expect it to hold in the fourth fiscal quarter as well. In terms of different parts within IoT, consumer is more aligned with phones. So we've seen that recover faster. The industrial networking is consistent with what our peers are seeing within those industries, and the recovery timeline is aligned with that. If you kind of step back and think about our business there, we're pretty excited about new products that are coming out. Cristiano talked about the PC set of products coming out later this year, device launch coming out later this year. In addition to that, we also have new products in industrial and WiFi 7 that will drive growth into this IoT segment as well.",

AI when extended to run on device, besides the benefit of working alongside the cloud, offers completely new use cases, privacy, security, latency, costs, personalization, etc. Here's how you should look into this: in the same way that when the smartphone started, you had a handful of apps that eventually grew to thousands and hundreds of thousands of apps, and that was really the user experience. I think we've just started. You're beginning to see some of those use cases, and you have exactly that moment. Some of the phones have 10 apps, and they're growing. One of the reasons we have the AI hub is that this is a new moment for the industry. It works a little bit differently. It's different than how you think about the traditional app store. You have many models, many in open-source models that they can run on a device, and they can be attached or built into any application. We are starting to see a lot of developer interest. As we said in the prepared remarks, we have over 100 different models, from models from OpenAI to Llama 3, many of which are quantized and optimized to the NPU, which when they are optimized, run four times faster than the model without optimization. Those models and those use cases started to be implemented in apps\u2014whether it's an image or associated with a camera, or a language. So we're in the beginning of that transition. We really like what we see because it's really creating a reason for people to buy a new device. It's going to be the same on PC. It's going to be the same as they come to cars as well and in industrial. So it's an exciting tailwind, I think, for our strategy of driving computing and connectivity at the edge.",

As we think about our strength in handsets, we are very optimistic that as we go forward, this is a trend that holds forward. This is not about inventory.

Firstly, much of the increased content in the average selling price on QCT chipsets, particularly premium ones, has been driven by the compute aspects. There\u2019s been enhanced performance in the CPU, GPU, and NPU. The NPU has seen the most significant growth in silicon for these chips. Year over year, one of the most notable advancements has been the NPU for AI, which is increasing the silicon content in devices due to the anticipated computational capacity needed for those models. Financial benefits are likely starting to emerge, improving the product mix. Consumers are eager to purchase more capable phones that can utilize AI, pushing the market toward a richer mix with greater share gains and prompting an upgrade cycle as people look to buy new phones. That's the perspective we should adopt regarding phones. The PC market operates a bit differently. As we advance in PCs, our on-device AI capabilities are set to surpass those of our competitors on laptops, which will provide a boost to performance. In the automotive sector, there's added value from the platforms currently in commercialization and design wins, with an expanding pipeline. We can implement software upgrades to run generative AI in those vehicles. This is how we foresee Qualcomm progressing. Lastly, in the industrial sector, we're focused on elevating performance from microcontrollers to high-performance computing connectivity. Edge AI is emerging as a crucial aspect of this market moving forward.",

We've given a range, and we've been operating at the high end of the range, but no kind of fundamentally change on the framework of it going forward. Yes.

In fiscal Q3, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $9.4 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.33, which was above the midpoint of our guidance range. Revenues from our chipset business of $8.1 billion reflect a sequential growth in automotive and IoT and continued traction of our Snapdragon mobile platforms across leading smartphones. Our automotive and IoT revenues were the result of ongoing execution of our diversification strategy. Licensing business revenues were $1.3 billion. Now I would like to share some key highlights from the business. In automotive, we secured more than 10 new design wins with global automakers during the quarter. These include next-generation digital cockpit connectivity and/or ADAS and autonomy. Our Snapdragon Digital Chassis continues to scale across virtually all OEMs and is now a key asset for the automotive industry. As we look forward, we're focused on extending our industry-leading on-device AI solutions to the Snapdragon Digital Chassis to enable automotive-centric Gen AI use cases and applications. It's important to note that our architecture with capabilities across all domains is uniquely positioned to enable sensor data to be utilized simultaneously for ADAS autonomy workloads and user-centric Gen AI experiences in the digital cockpit. A great example is our Snapdragon Ride Flex solution, which combines digital cockpit and ADAS on a single SoC. Future drivers for automotive growth include Gen AI experiences, the software-defined vehicle transition, central computing replacing microcontrollers, expansion into 2-wheelers, and core to cloud services. In handsets, we are pleased that all Galaxy Z Fold6 and Flip6 are powered by the Snapdragon 803 for Galaxy, delivering extraordinary AI capabilities, premium-level performance, and power efficiency for foldable devices. Together with Samsung and our other partners, we continue to push the boundaries of on-device Gen AI on mobile devices. To that end, we're pleased with the growth and trajectory of AI use cases on smartphones. This continued expansion of AI features is a precursor to next-generation smartphones, which we believe will become AI-centric with pervasive on-device AI working across applications in the cloud. Qualcomm is very well-positioned to help drive this transformation across the industry in the coming years. At our upcoming Snapdragon Summit in October, we will reveal details of our next-generation Snapdragon 8 flagship mobile platform, the first to be powered by our custom Oryon CPU. This platform, combined with new and unparalleled NPU AI capabilities, is already exceeding both our and our customers' performance expectations. In compute, we're very pleased that Copilot+ PCs powered exclusively by Snapdragon X Series platforms became available for purchase on June 18. This marks the start of one of the most significant transitions in personal computing since the launch of Windows 95 and is restoring performance leadership back to the Windows ecosystem. Twenty Copilot+ PCs from Microsoft, Dell, HP, Lenovo, Acer, ASUS, and Samsung are now available across 20 countries and 47 retailers. It's important to highlight the unique Copilot+ and Snapdragon ex-elite dedicated retail spaces in Best Buy, Costco, Curies, Harvey Norman, and many more. We are very pleased with the initial response, with several models selling out at retailers and online. Our retail presence is expected to expand to more than 60 retailers across 25 countries in the coming months. We're also working closely with more than 50 global commercial customers to drive Snapdragon readiness in their respective environments. Additionally, we added the Snapdragon X Series platforms to the Qualcomm AI hub, allowing developers to easily take advantage of optimized AI models to create responsive, power-efficient, and compelling on-device generative AI applications for Copilot+ PCs. As we look forward to 2025, we are already working with OEMs on the next wave of Copilot+ PCs. In addition to new design wins, our X Series product roadmap will expand to address PCs with retail prices as low as $700 without compromising NPU performance. Longer term, we believe the benefits of Snapdragon X Series platforms make it clear that the PC ecosystem has begun the transition to an ARM-compatible architecture. As we look forward, we're forecasting that at least 50% of PCs will be AI capable by 2027. Given our clear technology leadership and competitive roadmap, we expect to be positioned as one of the top silicon suppliers for these devices. We also remain excited about the continued positive momentum in XR, particularly the success of Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses. Sales are exceeding our expectations, due in part to the integration of Llama into the experience. We foresee an acceleration in demand for extended and mixed reality devices as new use cases enabled by Gen AI gain scale. Snapdragon XR remains the industry platform of choice, and we are engaged with major ecosystem players, including Meta, Google, Microsoft, and others. Most recently, at the Augmented World Expo, we showcased two of the latest XR devices, NTT's augmented reality glasses and Sony's upcoming head-mounted mixed reality device. In industrial IoT, we're pleased to report that we're now collaborating with Aramco on connectivity, AI, and advanced computing solutions for industrial and enterprise use cases in Saudi Arabia. This also includes accelerating the development of the industrial 4G, 5G, and non-terrestrial networks ecosystem, including the first significant wide-area private cellular network for IoT. As the industrial sector is transformed by AI, we expect an increase in demand for more complex on-device processing. This trend aligns well with our core capabilities, especially the computing and AI roadmap we have built for Auto and PC. As high-performance processing and intelligence at the edge becomes critical for the next phase of enterprise digital transformation, we see a unique opportunity to build a leadership position in this space. In the next few months, we will announce our new dedicated product roadmap for industrial IoT, including support for multiple operating systems and the ability to run multi-billion parameter AI models in a comprehensive development platform. Finally, we're very pleased to share that we recently signed a key long-term licensing agreement with Honor, a leading Chinese smartphone OEM. We continue to be pleased with the company's diversification beyond mobile, and we're particularly proud of what we have accomplished to date in automotive and PC. We will provide additional updates on our diversification strategy at our Investor Day in New York on November 19. I would now like to turn the call over to Akash.",

We are pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results with revenue of $9.4 billion and EPS of $2.33, both of which were above the midpoint of our guidance. QTL revenues of $1.3 billion and EBT margin of 70% were in line with our expectations. QCT delivered revenues of $8.1 billion and EBITDA margin of 27%, which was at the high end of our guidance range, driven by upside in both IoT and automotive. QCT handset revenues of $5.9 billion were in line with expectations, reflecting our scale in premium Android handsets and greater than 50% year-over-year growth in revenues from Chinese OEMs. QCT IoT revenues increased 9% sequentially to $1.4 billion as we continue to see a gradual recovery in the industry environment. We delivered our fourth consecutive quarter of record QCT automotive revenues of $811 million, with sequential growth of 34%. Our revenue acceleration reflects content growth in new vehicle launches as we become the leading supplier of advanced computing and connectivity solutions to the automotive industry. Lastly, we returned $2.3 billion to stockholders during the quarter, including $1.3 billion in stock repurchases and $949 million in dividends. Before turning to guidance, I would like to outline three factors included in our forecast. First, consistent with our long-term financial planning assumption of largely flat handset units, we continue to estimate global 3G/4G/5G units in calendar '24 to be flat to slightly up on a year-over-year basis. Second, our license to export products to Huawei, which was set to expire in late calendar '24, was revoked on May 7. This change will impact our revenues in both the current quarter and the first quarter of fiscal '25. Lastly, our fourth fiscal quarter includes an additional week as we align our fiscal reporting period with the calendar quarter end every 5 to 6 years. Now turning to fourth fiscal quarter guidance. We are forecasting revenues of $9.5 billion to $10.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.45 to $2.65. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.35 billion to $1.55 billion and EBT margins of 70% to 74%, reflecting normal seasonality for handset units. In QCT, we expect revenues of $8.1 billion to $8.7 billion and EBT margins of 27% to 29%. We expect QCT handset revenues to grow by low single-digit percentages sequentially. This forecast reflects an increase in purchases from a modem-only handset customer, partially offset by seasonally lower Android revenue ahead of our new Snapdragon premium chipset launch in the first quarter of fiscal '25. We expect QCT IoT revenues will increase by low double-digit percentages sequentially, driven by growth across consumer, networking, and industrial. Following our outperformance in the third quarter, we expect QCT automotive revenues to remain flat in the fourth fiscal quarter. We are on track to deliver approximately 50% year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal '24, providing confidence in our ability to execute to our long-term targets. Lastly, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.2 billion. In closing, we are pleased with our execution and financial performance in fiscal '24. Based on the midpoint of our guidance, we are on track to deliver strong non-GAAP EPS growth of approximately 20% relative to fiscal '23. Over the last quarter, industry support for our vision for on-device AI has accelerated and been validated by several key players. Beyond handsets and PCs, we expect on-device AI to drive competitive differentiation for us in industrial, networking, automotive, and XR. Our leading technology and product portfolio has positioned us to continue to execute on our diversification strategy. And in the months ahead, we look forward to introducing new industry-leading products across all our end markets. Finally, as Cristiano outlined, we'll be hosting our Investor Day on November 19, where we'll provide an update on our IoT and automotive diversification strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.",

We're very pleased with our automotive performance, and it's encouraging to see the pipeline translating into revenue. There are a couple of key points I want to highlight. Firstly, our automotive revenue is driven by our share of new car launches featuring our technology, which is relevant regardless of whether the industry is focused on internal combustion or electric vehicles. The Snapdragon Digital Chassis has become a vital asset in the automotive sector. In the last quarter alone, we launched 10 new models using our technology and secured 10 new design wins, which further enhances our pipeline. We're excited about the growth potential as these new cars hit the market. As mentioned earlier, we're on track to meet our goal of $4 billion by 2026. Additionally, Gen AI is creating exciting opportunities in automotive, particularly with large language models enhancing user interfaces for drivers. We're starting to see innovative use cases developing, which could lead to an upgrade in the digital cockpits we provide. Regarding PCs, we're pleased to report that performance has exceeded our expectations. The new Windows version, Copilot+, is built on an ARM-compatible architecture, and we're anticipating gradual ramp-up over time. Currently, we have 20 models launched that are surpassing our internal targets, with some models even selling out. We expect this momentum to continue as the market transitions. We will have new product announcements at IFA, and we're excited about the additional Copilot+ features being introduced by Microsoft. Similar to automotive, we believe PC will play a significant role in diversifying our company, and we will monitor its performance each quarter.",

This was reflected in some metrics shared by Akash, highlighting a 50% growth within China with local OEMs. This growth has expanded the size of the premium tier. Even in a market with flat or low single-digit growth, the premium tier is experiencing faster expansion. We are observing a larger premium tier supported by AI. In response to your question, we are pleased with the progress of AI features. We began with a few but now have tens of AI features, and once we reach 100, we'll notice a shift where a smartphone with AI features will be considered an AI smartphone. We don\u2019t have any unrealistic expectations in our model, but we are optimistic about the direction this is heading, which could lead to an intriguing upside if we enter an AI-driven upgrade cycle. It's still early, but the use cases are getting more compelling. I mentioned the increased use cases in the Galaxy Flip6 and Fold6. China has several use cases that will be introduced in the next flagship. You also asked about integrating AI into mid-tier devices, and we plan to do that. Similar to our approach with PCs, we are expanding our roadmap without compromising on AI capabilities, which will also apply to our mobile strategy. I am particularly excited about the upcoming launch of our next Snapdragon featuring our custom CPU. You will see a comparable shift in performance that we achieved in the PC ecosystem, restoring performance in the Windows ecosystem; we aim to replicate that in smartphones, with AI playing a significant role in the narrative.",

But we also noted recently that we have two major Chinese OEM signed long-term. While we haven't named them, they are significant handset manufacturers. And then we're working through negotiations with others that we still have optimistic expectations in terms of getting them signed up. We also recently announced that we signed a tranche to a 5G license, and we're still negotiating with them. There's some litigation ongoing, but I think the important thing is to focus on the 5G license with that company and the ongoing negotiations.

With respect to our partnership with Apple, we are sticking to the framework we outlined previously. After extending the chipset agreement, we expect to maintain that alignment. Currently, we have no new information to share, and any developments beyond what we communicated before would be considered a bonus.  When considering the application processor, the discussion becomes more intriguing. We have consistently maintained our leadership in AI performance, sustained peak performance, and mobile gaming through our Adreno GPU. For the first time in some time, we will introduce our own custom CPU, which will be unveiled at the Snapdragon Summit and included in flagship devices launching towards the end of this year and early 2025. I believe this will enhance our advantage in application processors.  Additionally, as I mentioned in this earnings call, the launch of the Copilot+ PC marks a significant transition for Qualcomm, shifting our perception from a communications-focused company to a key player in computing.

Just very recently here, obviously, in the quarter, there's a huge step-up in the auto portfolio, and I think you guys did a good job of kind of describing what drove that. But you've also, in your deck and kind of in your commentary, talking more about AI PC being a driver. Cristiano, if you look at kind of the next 12 months, you hosted an Auto Analyst Day and you kind of talked about the opportunity being back-end loaded, and I think the end date was kind of the late 2020s. But if you look at the next 12 months, what opportunity do you think is more exciting to you, the automotive side or the IoT in terms of revenue growth? Obviously, the buckets are different sizes, but just breaking those 2 out as to what can drive some growth there. And then on the Akash side, if you look into Q4, you obviously have an extra week there, but you are seeing OpEx step down. Could you just walk through the moving parts that I would expect it to be up a little bit just given the extra week?",

You should think of Qualcomm not only as a company focused on building one large business of differentiation, but rather as one that is developing multiple businesses of diversification. We are very focused on this strategy. When we mention Auto Investor Day, held in September 2022, we outlined how it will evolve into a significant platform for Qualcomm and positively impact our financials. This quarter, you can see those results starting to materialize, and we expect this trend to continue. Our pipeline is substantial, with projections of $4 billion in 2026 and $9 billion towards the end of the decade, and we are on track to meet these goals.  Regarding PCs, it is still early, but we are very pleased with the progress as it is exceeding our expectations, with some models already sold out. I anticipate that by the next Investor Day, we will be ready to share specific metrics regarding its expected growth and overall contribution to Qualcomm. This is an area we are particularly excited about, but we are not stopping there. I encourage you to watch what we will reveal next quarter. AI and computing are driving our industrial roadmap, which we are currently redesigning and will unveil in the coming months. We believe many markets can benefit from our technology.

And so it's just timing of non-labor spend that drove it. But fundamentally, no change in kind of the way we are managing OpEx. We're very committed to operating discipline and hiring, even when we do it, it is very focused on specific new skills that are required for diversification.

          "content": "Thank you, Mauricio, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In fiscal Q4, we delivered non-GAAP revenues of $10.2 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.69. Chipset business revenues were $8.7 billion, and licensing business revenues were $1.5 billion. During Q4 in fiscal '24, we continued to make progress on our growth and diversification strategy, addressing new end markets for Qualcomm's technology. Our differentiated technology and product roadmaps lead in every industry in which we now participate, and we are very optimistic about the edge AI momentum across our business. As such, we will continue to transform Qualcomm from a wireless communications company into a connected computing company for the age of AI. In the current environment, more than ever, we remain extremely focused on executing our strategy and targets while maintaining operating discipline and creating value for our stockholders. I will now share some key highlights from across the business. As the strong pace of AI innovation continues, there is now broad recognition of the opportunity for on-device AI to enable new capabilities and transform the human-computer interface. On-device AI provides context, enhances immediacy and reliability, and enables personalization while providing privacy and security. Additionally, GenAI-enabled devices and applications are evolving to understand natural language, images, sound, and the world around us, driving a new generation of AI-first experiences. This has the potential to create a new cycle of semiconductor innovation and content, and Qualcomm is well positioned to capitalize on this opportunity across devices at the edge. We shared this vision at the recent Snapdragon Summit with the support of key industry leaders, including Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, OpenAI, Mistral AI, IBM, and others. Together with our ecosystem partners, we're driving this transition to AI-enabled edge computing to empower consumers and enterprises by enhancing productivity, entertainment, creativity, convenience, and more. Notably, we're partnering with Meta to support Llama 3.2, including their multimodal 11 billion, 3 billion, and 1 billion parameter models on Snapdragon-powered devices. We're also working with Amazon to create a cloud-to-edge solution that allows developers to customize their models on SageMaker and deploy them to Qualcomm and Snapdragon platforms via the AI Hub. Model availability on the AI Hub has grown by more than 50% since last quarter with both open-source and proprietary models. In handsets, we recently unveiled the Snapdragon 8 Elite, our latest flagship mobile platform, which features our second-generation custom Oryon CPU. This CPU delivers up to 30% faster performance with 57% less power, a significant leap over the first generation in less than a year. Snapdragon 8 Elite is the world's fastest mobile processor, restoring performance leadership to the Android ecosystem. In addition, Snapdragon 8 Elite introduces a newly architected Hexagon NPU, delivering a 45% improvement in both performance and power efficiency over Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. Combined with the improved CPU and GPU, Snapdragon 8 Elite can dynamically manage AI workloads and handle the complexities of multimodal GenAI in real time. We are extremely pleased with the Snapdragon 8 Elite design traction with successful launches at Xiaomi, Honor, Oppo, and Vivo, and we look forward to additional launches at Samsung, ASUS, and more. In a short period of time, our Snapdragon X Series platforms have redefined personal computing. Building on the initial launch momentum, we have expanded our portfolio with the addition of the Snapdragon X Plus 8-core compute platform. The X Plus 8-core maintains leadership in performance and battery life, enabling OEMs to offer thin and light Copilot+ PCs with transformative, uncompromised on-device AI at more affordable price points. This makes next-gen AI PCs accessible to even more users, expanding our addressable market. We are very pleased that leading OEMs, including Dell, HP, Lenovo, Samsung, Acer, and ASUS, will all have devices powered by our X Plus 8-core platform. We now have a total of 58 platforms launched or in development across the X Series portfolio. Snapdragon X Series power laptops will also be the first to get the new Copilot+ PC features announced on October 1, including Recall, Click To Do, improved search, super resolution in photos, generative fill, and erase in Paint. In XR, together with Meta, we continue to enable the future of spatial computing. The recently announced Quest 3S powered by Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 delivers a more affordable headset, targeting users new to mixed reality and immersive experiences. This is an important milestone in increasing the scale of this opportunity. Additionally, the Snapdragon AR1 Gen 1 powered Ray-Ban Meta glasses are receiving new AI features, including location and navigation assistance, real-time speech translation, answering questions about their environment, and hands-free access to users' digital lives. We're also pleased that Snap recently unveiled their next-generation Spectacles powered by dual Snapdragon processors, which are aimed at creators exploring advanced AR experiences. Industrial IoT is evolving with advanced edge computing and intelligence, driving demand for our technologies and providing a significant future opportunity for Qualcomm. To that end, we recently announced the Qualcomm IQ Series, a new family of industrial-grade solutions specifically designed to meet the needs of next-generation industrial edge applications. With on-device AI performance of up to 100 TOPS and the ability to operate in extreme conditions, along with a suite of building safety features, the Qualcomm IQ Series of chipsets are purpose-built to power a wide range of solutions, including inspection and automation, robotics, drones, advanced computer vision, edge AI boxes, and gateways, and more. Additionally, we introduced the Qualcomm IoT Solutions Framework, which helps enterprises build solutions that enable easy development of end-to-end applications, reduce time to implementation, and improve operational efficiencies. This all-encompassing framework features recommended chipsets and core software support for multiple operating systems, such as Android, Linux, and Windows, tailored reference designs, software libraries, SDKs, supplementary cloud-based services, and microservices, along with access to a growing network of channel partners. In edge networking, we announced the Networking Pro A7 Elite platform, the first commercial platform to revolutionize enterprise and home networking connectivity with edge AI. This platform includes Wi-Fi 7, 5G, 10-gigabit PON, Ethernet, and an AI co-processor with 40 TOPS of NPU processing power. The transformative integration of connectivity and computing power into the network unlocks opportunities for operators and enterprises to deploy innovative applications and services in areas such as security and surveillance, energy management and automation, personalized virtual assistance, and health monitoring, among others. Edge AI also enhances privacy by processing sensitive information on the gateway while enabling personalization through contextualized understanding of the environment and immediacy to near real-time responses. Finally, in automotive, we recently announced our most powerful platforms to date, the Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Snapdragon Ride Elite. Both feature our category-leading custom Oryon CPU, now optimized for automotive safety standards and designed for 3x faster CPU performance over previous generations. These platforms are also developed for current and future multimodal AI in assisted driving workloads, featuring our dedicated Hexagon NPU with up to 12x increased AI performance over the previous generation, a substantial upgrade. The Snapdragon Cockpit Elite powers advanced digital experiences, including robust multimedia capabilities, such as gaming and advanced 3D graphics, on-device AI with fully integrated edge orchestrator, optimized safety and security, and long-term software support. The Snapdragon Ride Elite platform offers an end-to-end ADAS system with advanced features, such as vision perception, sensor fusion, path planning, localization, and complete vehicle control. Additionally, these platforms are built on a unique flexible architecture that gives automakers the option to combine both digital cockpit and automated driving functionalities on the same SoC. We are pleased that leading car manufacturers are adopting Snapdragon Elite automotive platforms for their future software-defined vehicles, including Li Auto and Mercedes-Benz. We are very pleased with the progress we have made this year with significant advancements on our product roadmap and customer engagement across multiple end markets. I look forward to sharing more about our strategy and progress at our upcoming growth and diversification focus Investor Day in New York on November 19. I will now turn the call to Akash.",

          "content": "Thank you, Cristiano, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our Fourth fiscal quarter earnings. We are pleased to announce strong non-GAAP results with revenues of $10.2 billion and EPS of $2.69, which was above the high end of our guidance. QTL revenues of $1.5 billion and EBT margin of 74% were at the high end of our guidance driven by slightly higher handset units in the quarter. QCT delivered revenues of $8.7 billion and EBT margin of 28% with revenues at the high end of our guidance range on strength in both IoT and automotive. QCT handset revenues of $6.1 billion were in line with our expectations for the quarter. QCT IoT revenues of $1.7 billion increased 24% from the prior quarter due to the benefit of new product launches and continued normalization of channel inventory. We delivered our fifth consecutive quarter of record QCT automotive revenues of $899 million with sequential growth of 11% and year-over-year growth of 68% on continued content increase in new vehicle launches. Lastly, we returned $2.2 billion to stockholders, including $1.3 billion in stock repurchases and $947 million in dividends. Before turning to guidance, I'll summarize our fiscal '24 results. We are very pleased with our execution and financial performance in fiscal '24. We delivered revenues of $39 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $10.22, a growth of 21% on a year-over-year basis. Our results reflect the benefit of operating leverage as we maintain fiscal discipline and manage non-GAAP operating expenses relatively flat as compared to fiscal '23. In QTL, we made significant progress in our ability to maintain revenue and margin scale as a result of completing a number of licensing renewals during the year. In QCT handsets, we delivered greater than 20% year-over-year growth in Android revenues driven by the technology leadership of our premium-tier Snapdragon products and normalization of channel inventory. Consistent with expectations outlined at the beginning of the fiscal year, QCT IoT revenues grew sequentially in each of the following quarters throughout the year. In a challenging industry environment, we delivered full year revenue growth of 55% in QCT automotive, extending our leadership in automotive computing and connectivity platforms. Lastly, our business generated record free cash flow of $11.2 billion, and our balance sheet remains strong with $13.3 billion in cash and marketable securities. Turning to guidance. We now expect global 3G, 4G, 5G handset units to increase by low to mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis in calendar '24. For the first quarter of fiscal '25, we are forecasting revenues of $10.5 billion to $11.3 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $2.85 to $3.05. In QTL, we estimate revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion and EBT margins of 73% to 77%, reflecting normal seasonality for handset units when adjusted for the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal '24. In QCT, we expect revenues of $9 billion to $9.6 billion and EBT margins of 29% to 31%. We expect QCT handset revenues to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage on a year-over-year basis. This forecast includes greater than 40% sequential revenue growth from Chinese OEMs and the acceleration of flagship Android handset launches powered by our recently announced Snapdragon 8 Elite platform. We anticipate QCT IoT revenues to increase by more than 20% on a year-over-year basis with growth across consumer, industrial, and networking. Following our outperformance in the fourth quarter, this forecast reflects a seasonal sequential decline consistent with the last 2 fiscal years. We expect QCT automotive revenues to grow by 50% relative to last year and be approximately flat on a sequential basis. Lastly, we estimate non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.2 billion. In closing, I want to thank our employees for their hard work and dedication and remaining focused on execution while delivering industry-leading products. The last few weeks have marked a meaningful acceleration in our progress towards our diversification strategy, and I'd like to highlight some significant product announcements. First, we announced our Snapdragon X Plus platform at IFA Conference, which extends our performance leadership to the $700 price-tier for personal computers. Second, at the Embedded World North America, we introduced the most comprehensive chipset and software portfolio for AI-ready industrial IoT solutions. And third, at the Snapdragon Summit, we unveiled the Snapdragon 8 Elite handset platform, featuring the world's fastest mobile CPU; and the Snapdragon Cockpit Elite and Snapdragon Ride Elite automotive platforms, establishing us as a performance leader in digital cockpit and ADAS. Lastly, we look forward to seeing you in New York on November 19, where we will expand on these exciting product announcements with an update on our IoT and automotive diversification strategy. This concludes our prepared remarks. Back to you, Mauricio.",

And then also maybe some metrics you can give us on how much is infotainment versus ADAS?

One of the things I want to point out is it's one of the biggest upgrades to date in order of magnitude, about 12x on AI. As we said before, I think GenAI use cases on a car, especially a little different approach, is about future-proofing that design for software-defined vehicles, is getting a lot of traction to a lot of OEMs. We announced two that made public, but I think design traction on that chipset is actually very high.",

If we sort of back out your top 2 customers, handsets are up, I think, around 50% year-over-year. Any metrics you can give us on units versus ASPs? I know there was an inventory dynamic last year. So as we think about the sustainability of that growth vector into 2025, in particular, for the China market, would be curious if there's any incremental metrics you can give us outside your top 2 customers.",

The key highlight for us has been the increase in content. We\u2019ve observed that chipsets are becoming significantly more advanced, as evidenced by the announcement of X Elite 8 Elite last month, which incorporates much more content into the chip. As these solutions gain traction, we also experience positive impacts on the average selling price. Additionally, the distribution across different tiers is improving in the handset market. So if you kind of look back over the last 3 or 4 years, devices greater than $400 have gone up from being 21% of the market to 30% of the market, and that is definitely beneficial to us. Maybe one last point is, if you think about our guidance for the December quarter, we do not have any Huawei product revenue in our guidance. A year ago quarter, we did have Huawei product revenue. So it's actually something that we have overcome, and then we have growth on top of it.",

And it's less about other tiers, more about the fact that we launched our new premium-tier chipset, and the OEMs are actively taking advantage of it by accelerating their launches and really increasing the scale of their launches. Yes. It's very much normal. It's really the extra week coming out and the normal sequential quarter-over-quarter growth.",

But I'll give you a couple of data points to help you triangulate that. When we look sequentially, we have now quarter-over-quarter greater than 40% handset revenue growth with Chinese OEMs as we look into the 1Q fiscal '25, if you look at the guide. In fiscal '24, our Android revenues showed 20% year-over-year growth, including the loss of Huawei revenues. And when we compare with our closest competitor, for example, in Android, our premium tier, we reported greater than 5x the premium-tier revenue. So I think it shows a couple of things. As Akash outlined, content is increasing. The premium tier is expanding in the market and stabilizing. And we don't see much of the inventory dynamics we used to see. So I think it speaks a little bit to the strength of our product roadmap and the launch of new products from customers in China, but more importantly, this trend that the mix is really improving.",

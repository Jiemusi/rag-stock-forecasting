          "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. For the last several years, we have been on a journey to both scale and transform AMD. We have consistently executed our strategy, expanded our portfolio of leadership products and diversified our business, all while driving best-in-class growth. We reached a significant inflection point in our journey during the first few months of 2022, as we took several major steps that fundamentally reshaped our business. In addition to delivering record financial results, we closed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx and announced our plans to acquire Pensando. The strategic importance of the Xilinx acquisition to our long-term goals cannot be overstated. As the industry\u2019s number one provider of FPGA and adaptive computing solutions, Xilinx significantly expands our technology and product portfolio. Xilinx also adds multiple high-margin long-term revenue streams spending a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. Importantly, Xilinx has successfully executed its own growth strategy in recent years with the increased adoption of adaptive silicon across data center, communications, automotive and other large embedded markets. With Pensando, we will further expand our data center solutions capabilities. Pensando will add a proven team that has developed an industry-leading DPU and software stack already deployed with key customers, including IBM, HPE, Microsoft, Oracle and Goldman Sachs. Pensando\u2019s differentiated technology further expands our product portfolio and will enable AMD to innovate at the silicon, software and platform levels to deliver leadership solutions for our cloud, enterprise and edge customers. Now turning to our first quarter financial performance, we started the year very strong with record quarterly revenue and net income. First quarter revenue, including the contributions from six weeks of Xilinx, grew 71% year-over-year to a record $5.9 billion. We expanded gross margin 7 percentage points to 53% and more than doubled both operating and net income year-over-year. Excluding Xilinx, revenue grew 55% year-over-year to a record $5.3 billion, gross margin expanded 5 percentage points to 51% and operating income more than doubled to a record $1.6 billion. Turning to our Computing and Graphics segment, revenue increased 33% year-over-year to $2.8 billion, driven primarily by the ramp of our latest Ryzen and Radeon products. Client compute revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year based on higher Ryzen mobile and desktop processor sales. As a result, we believe we gained client processor revenue share for the eighth straight quarter. In Desktop, we expanded our processor portfolio with the introduction of seven new Ryzen CPUs, including the Ryzen 5800X3D, which is the industry\u2019s fastest gaming CPU and first desktop processor featuring 3D stacked chiplets. In Notebooks, record mobile processor revenue was driven by the launch of our Rembrandt Ryzen 6000 mobile processors that extend the leadership compute, gaming and battery life capabilities of our mobile processors. In Commercial, we recently introduced our latest Ryzen 6000 PRO processors with leadership performance and battery life and modern security and manageability features. We are well positioned to accelerate our growth in commercial notebooks in 2022 based on the expanded number of design wins on track to launch. Although, the PC market is experiencing some softness coming off multiple quarters of near-record unit shipments, our focus remains on the premium, gaming and commercial portions of the market where we see strong growth opportunities and we expect to continue gaining overall client revenue share. In Graphics, revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, with record desktop graphics channel sales. Desktop GPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year, as sales of our Radeon 6000 series graphics cards were strong. In Mobile, the first notebooks featuring our latest Radeon 6000 mobile GPUs launched in the quarter, and we expect sales to ramp over the coming quarters. Data center graphics revenue was flat year-over-year as we launched our Instinct MI210 accelerators. We expanded our engagements with large cloud customers in the quarter and launched our ROCm 5.0 software suite targeting exoscale-class, HPC and AI applications. Turning to our Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segment, revenue increased 88% year-over-year to $2.5 billion, driven by record server, Semi-Custom and Embedded processor sales. Semi-Custom sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year based on strong demand for Sony and Microsoft consoles, as well as Valve\u2019s new Steam Deck. Sales for this game console generation continued to outpace all prior generations and we expect 2022 to be a record year for our Semi-Custom business. Turning to our Embedded business, revenue more than doubled year-over-year led by growth in automotive. We also secured multiple design wins in next-generation security and firewall devices from Tier 1 networking providers. Turning to Server, we had another record quarter as revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We have more than doubled Server processor revenue year-over-year in eight of the last ten quarters, highlighting the growing demand for our EPYC processors with cloud, enterprise and HPC customers. Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscalers expanded their internal infrastructure deployments, and 70 new AMD-powered instances launched from Alibaba, Amazon, Baidu Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google and others. There are now more than 460 AMD-based cloud instances available from the largest hyperscalers, with additional instances on track to launch in the coming quarters. In Enterprise, revenue more than doubled year-over-year with strong growth in key verticals including IT infrastructure, financial services and database applications. Our sales pipeline continues to be very strong and we saw our win rate grow in the first quarter across a broad set of Enterprise end customers. We launched our first EPYC processors with 3D stacked chiplets in the quarter. This technology extends our performance leadership in technical computing workloads by up to 66% compared to our prior generation. Atos, Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo and Supermicro all launched Servers featuring the new CPUs in the quarter. Excitement for our next-generation Genoa server processors continues to grow, as we expanded customer and partnering sampling in the quarter. We expect Genoa will be the industry\u2019s highest performance general-purpose server CPU, further extending the performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages of our EPYC processors. We remain on track to launch Genoa in the second half of the year and expect to continue our share gain trajectory based on expanded cloud, enterprise and HPC customer adoption. In addition, development of our higher core count Bergamo processors optimized for high-throughput cloud workloads continues to progress well with shipments on track to begin in the first half of 2023. Turning to the Xilinx business, for the six weeks following acquisition close, Xilinx revenue was $559 million. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx delivered its fourth straight quarter of greater than 20% year-over-year revenue growth and the second straight quarter of greater than $1 billion of revenue. In Data Center, first quarter demand was led by expanded FPGA as a service and smartNIC deployments at Tier 1 hyperscalers, as well as low-latency network solutions with fintech companies. We saw strength in Communications led by wired demand and access and optical transport. In wireless, Versal based 5G deployments continued ramping in multiple regions and we secured a strategic design win with a Tier 1 communications equipment provider to power their next-gen baseband solutions with the Versal ACAP solution. We saw strong demand across the Xilinx Embedded markets led by record pro forma full quarter revenue in automotive, industrial, vision and healthcare and consumer. Looking forward, we see very strong demand across all the Xilinx end markets and are focused on increasing supply. Turning to our integration work, in the first few months since close, we have seen tremendous excitement from our customers, partners and employees, and we expect to see significant product and revenue synergies. We now have the best portfolio of high performance and adaptive computing engines in the industry, and we see multiple opportunities to leverage our expanded technology portfolio to deliver even stronger products. As one example, we are integrating Xilinx\u2019s differentiated AI engine across our CPU product portfolio to enable industry-leading inference capabilities, with the first products expected in 2023. We have also identified significant additional revenue synergy opportunities with some of our largest customers, as we can now address a larger portion of their compute needs with our expanded product portfolio. In summary, the start of 2022 is a significant inflection point for AMD, marked by record top and bottom line financial results, driven by our leadership product portfolio and strong execution and the close of our Xilinx acquisition. We have now delivered greater than 45% year-over-year revenue growth for seven straight quarters and increased net income by more than 60% year-over-year for the last ten quarters. Based on higher AMD organic growth, as well as the addition of Xilinx with strong demand across multiple end markets, we now expect annual revenue to grow by approximately 60% year-over-year, up from approximately 31% growth we guided at the beginning of the year. Longer term, I am incredibly excited about our additional growth opportunities as we add the Xilinx and Pensando teams. We now see a significantly larger TAM opportunity for AMD across a diverse set of end markets based on our broad portfolio of leadership compute engines and expanded solutions capabilities. I look forward to sharing more about the products and technologies that will enable the next stage of our growth journey at Financial Analyst Day in June. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our first quarter financial performance. Devinder?",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. The first quarter was an excellent start to the year with strong demand for our legacy products resulting in record quarterly revenue, continued gross margin expansion, record profitability and record cash flow generation. In addition, we are very pleased to have closed the Xilinx transaction and announced our intention to acquire Pensando. First quarter consolidated revenue was $5.9 billion, up 71% from a year ago, driven by significant growth across all businesses and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue for the partial period. Excluding the Xilinx contribution, AMD revenue was $5.3 billion, up 55% from a year ago with Data Center revenue doubling year-over-year. Gross margin was 53%, up 660 basis points from a year ago, driven by higher server processor revenue and high margin Xilinx revenue. Gross margin for AMD excluding Xilinx was 51%, up 480 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher Server processor revenue. Operating expenses were $1.3 billion compared to $830 million a year ago as we increased investments in our long-term product roadmaps to support the future growth of our business. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to a record $1.8 billion, up $1.1 billion, primarily driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 31%, up from 22% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.6 billion, up $947 million from a year ago. Diluted earnings per share was $1.13 per share, compared to $0.52 per share a year ago. Now turning to first quarter business segment results. Computing and Graphics segment revenue was $2.8 billion, up 33% year-over-year, driven by higher client and graphics processor revenue. Computing and Graphics segment operating income was $723 million or 26% of revenue, compared to $485 million or 23% of revenue a year ago. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. Enterprise Embedded and Semi-Custom segment revenue was $2.5 billion, up 88% from $1.3 billion in the prior year. The strong revenue increase was driven by higher Server, Semi-Custom and Embedded revenue. EESC segment operating income grew significantly to $881 million or 35% of revenue compared to $277 million or 21% of revenue a year ago. The higher operating income and margin were driven by increased revenue, richer product mix and an $83 million licensing gain. Xilinx revenue for the partial quarter was $559 million with operating income of $233 million or 42% of revenue. On a pro forma basis for the full quarter, Xilinx generated over $1 billion of revenue, up 22% compared to a year ago, with growth across all Xilinx major end market categories. We are on track to achieve our cost synergy goals for the acquisition and expect the addition of Xilinx to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share for 2022. Turning to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $6.5 billion at the end of the first quarter. We deployed $1.9 billion to repurchase common stock in the first quarter. To date, we have utilized $3.7 billion of our initial $4 billion stock repurchase program. We also announced a new $8 billion share repurchase program during the quarter. In total we had $8.3 billion in remaining authorization at the end of the first quarter. Quarterly free cash flow was a record $924 million, compared to $832 million in the same quarter last year and $736 million in the prior quarter. We successfully executed a five-year $3 billion sustainability-linked credit facility to replace our existing $500 million facility. This further demonstrates our commitment to our corporate ESG goals. Inventory was $2.4 billion, up $436 million from the prior quarter due to the addition of Xilinx inventory. Before I turn to our financial outlook, let me cover our financial segment reporting. Beginning with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we plan to change our segment reporting to the following four segments, Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded, which will align our financial reporting with our strategic end markets. I look forward to sharing further details with you at our Financial Analyst Day. Today\u2019s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current global supply environment and customer demand signals. For the second quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.5 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 69% year-over-year and approximately 10% quarter-over-quarter. The year-over-year increase is expected to be driven by the addition of Xilinx revenue plus higher Server, Semi-Custom and Client revenue. The quarter-over-quarter increase is expected to be primarily driven by Xilinx revenue plus higher server revenue. In addition for Q2 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.56 billion or 24% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on a 13% effective tax rate and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. For the full year 2022, we now expect revenue to be approximately $26.3 billion, an increase of approximately 60% driven by Xilinx and higher Server and Semi-Custom revenue. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 24% of revenue, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and non-GAAP cash tax to be approximately 10% due primarily to U.S. tax requirements to capitalize R&D and the full utilization of our U.S. net operating losses and tax credits in 2022. Fiscal year 2022 will be a 53-week year and include an additional week in the fourth quarter. In closing, we had an excellent start to 2022 with strong revenue growth across all businesses. We are pleased to have completed the Xilinx acquisition, which strengthens our business model with revenue diversification, accretive gross margin and increased cash generation. We are very delighted to welcome the Xilinx team to AMD. Looking ahead, AMD is very well-positioned for long-term growth, margin expansion and cash generation, driven by our leadership products and roadmaps. With that, I will turn the call back over to Laura to begin the Q&A portion of our call. Laura?",

I guess there\u2019s a lot going on from a macro perspective in the markets that you serve and then the supply chains, Lisa. So, I mean, the first half of the year I think you\u2019re doing, I don\u2019t know 54%, 55% organic growth in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk me through a bit the puts and takes in the quarter. I think there\u2019s a perception that you have additional supply coming online. There\u2019s obviously supply constraints and lockdowns in China, your server business doing extraordinarily well in the numbers that you just printed and then maybe some perception of the softening in the PC market. So there\u2019s a lot going on and I kind of love you to walk me through the puts and takes for the quarter if you could? Thank you.",

I would say, if you look at the strength in our business in the first quarter, it was really broad-based. So, very, very strong server results. We continue to gain share, we continue to bring more supply online. There also are very strong results in our Semi-Custom or game console business, as well as in the client and graphics businesses. There is some softness in the PC market, but we had for the last number of quarters actually been shifting our mix to the higher end or the more premium segments of the PC market. And so that\u2019s where more of our exposure is. And we actually saw a significant growth in our PC business sequentially as we started ramping our Ryzen 6000 notebooks and that resulted in strong ASP growth, as well as just our key market segments of Premium, Commercial and Gaming being covered there. As we go forward, obviously, all of the things that you talked about are in play. That being the case, I think, we have managed through the supply situations very well. We continue to work with our customers and ensure that we are optimizing our builds to their build and with the addition of Xilinx we also have another set of end markets that have very strong demand that are all additive to our business.",

Obviously, it includes Xilinx, so it\u2019s a little bit apples and oranges from last year. But I think in the press release, you guys mentioned that you expect some upside from the original 31% organic growth guidance. If you have any comments on magnitude there that would be helpful? And then I think just what investors would love to hear from you is maybe your view on the Data Center CapEx spending environment and also on the PC market. I think you guys have been maybe a bit more conservative than some of your competition in your market commentary about PCs maybe being flattish coming into this year. I imagine there\u2019s some new puts and takes to that. So just some thoughts on how you guys constructed the guidance for the year, especially relative to the original 31% would be really helpful?

Initially, we projected an organic growth of 31% for the AMD business based on our market observations in January. However, after reassessing the current market conditions and our customer and supply situation, we now anticipate organic growth to be in the mid-30% range. This improvement is mainly due to strong demand in our server business and the Semi-Custom sector, along with additional supply coming online. We've adopted a more cautious stance on the PC market. While there is softness in certain areas, it is not prevalent across the entire market, and we are concentrating on segments where we provide the most value, particularly the Premium segments. Additionally, the inclusion of three-and-a-half quarters of Xilinx is a substantial contributor. On a pro forma basis, the Xilinx business is also experiencing solid growth, estimated in the low 20% range compared to the calendar year 2021. Overall, we have a diverse array of growth drivers and various avenues for expansion as we move forward, and we are actively collaborating with our customers to meet their demands.",

We have made a lot of progress on both the wafer side and significant investments on the substrates. I would say that, we continue to get sort of very good support from our suppliers. That\u2019s one of the reasons we can increase our guidance the way it is. From an overall, you mentioned the China COVID situation. From our standpoint, we haven\u2019t had any significant impact on our own shipments and our own supply chain. We have been working with some customers that have had some customer build delays and that is contemplated in our second quarter guidance. We are going to continue to work on supply optimization with the addition of Xilinx, some of the, let\u2019s call it, more mature nodes, 16-nanometer and above wafer supply is still somewhat constrained. We are working with sort of the larger scale of AMD to try to bring more supply on board there, as well as continuing to ramp our overall capacity to support a very strong sort of next few quarters.

I am curious how meaningful Data Center was as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, Server CPU, Data Center GPU and now FPGAs from Xilinx. And I guess more importantly, how are you thinking about the medium- to long-term opportunity in both your classic Data Center GPU business, as well as the FPGA business. I think in Data Center GPU, you mentioned that it was flat in the quarter, but you also talked about being engaged with more cloud customers, so curious what you are seeing there.

We\u2019re also optimistic about our GPU portfolio, which is a longer-term initiative that parallels our CPU efforts. Last year, we focused on supercomputing and high-performance computing, which is why our year-on-year growth appears flat. We are actively investing in our AI capabilities, enhancing our software stack, and collaborating with cloud partners to improve our offerings. Furthermore, with our investments in FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, and the Pensando acquisition, we have built a formidable portfolio that meets the needs of both large cloud hyperscalers and enterprise clients, while also reaching into the edge market.

It\u2019s not about point things. It\u2019s about the total solution. And as you probably know, scale-out in just a lot of these applications, you could be throttled by the network.

I am curious, what\u2019s the state of play in front of the next-gen Genoa versus the Sapphire Rapids server cycle from two perspectives? First, just from the industry adoption of DDR5, can that be a bottleneck to adoption of these next-generation servers? And second perspective is that you will have two different flavors of Genoa with the cloud optimized version coming later. So just give us your sense of how this next generation cycle plays out versus the very strong success you had in Milan so far?",

Looking ahead to the next-generation Genoa platform, there's significant excitement and customer demand, and I anticipate that it will also sit alongside Milan for an extended period since infrastructure transitions won't happen overnight. Regarding Bergamo, the cloud-optimized version will cater to large hyperscalers seeking enhanced performance per dollar and per watt.

However, as we progressed through the year and assessed market conditions, we decided to adopt a more cautious outlook for the PC market. For our full-year guidance, we are projecting a decline of high-single digits. While many factors could influence this outlook, we believe it's a reasonable estimate at this time. We are committed to focusing on areas where we can provide significant value, particularly in the Premium segments. Our Ryzen 6000, which includes the Rembrandt product, is well-positioned in terms of battery life and performance. We also have several strong Commercial systems set to launch, which we are excited about. Regarding our Commercial market share, we recognize that we are currently underrepresented, and improving that is a key objective for us. Overall, we believe we are targeting the right segments for market share growth, even amid a weaker PC market, and we expect to increase our revenue share as we pursue our strategy. Additionally, we have numerous growth opportunities across our business, especially by leveraging our Data Center, PC, Gaming, and Xilinx portfolios collectively.

But, look, I am very pleased with the fact that we are growing both Cloud and Enterprise very substantially.

How could we think about flexibility from a perspective of capacity? If PC slow down, can your capacity be fungible and move that capacity over to Servers or even Xilinx capacity into Server CPUs?

So we are complementary there as our primary wafer supplier. We use very similar substrate suppliers as well. The Xilinx portfolio tends to be on more mature nodes although there is some 7-nanometer of the majority of the portfolio is on 60-nanometer and above. So I would say, there\u2019s not much fungibility there. However, on the backend, on the substrate side, there is very good fungibility across the portfolio. And from the standpoint of overall supply, I think, you have heard from Devinder, we have invested significantly over the last 18 months in sort of securing the supply capacity and we are seeing it come online and that\u2019s again what I\u2019d like to do is as you see it come online that\u2019s when it will go into our revenue forecast. But I feel very good about the progress that we are making and we are continued to dimension the company for just a much larger business and so it\u2019s a lot of supply that we are bringing online.

EPYC\u2019s attached to catalyze. Ryzen attached to their FPGA solution. So maybe Victor can help us understand like what percentage of Xilinx FPGA solutions in the Embedded market sits next to either an x86 or high-performance ARM processor, because I think that the processor opportunity in Embedded is much larger than the FPGA opportunity and I believe that Embedded is a pretty small percentage of overall business for AMD, so pretty big opportunity, but wanted to get your views.",

And I wonder, you have seen other companies with general-purpose computing solutions kind of add a communications capability. And I am wondering, is there an opportunity for more data processing at the network edge, like say at the base station where Xilinx has historically been really strong?

Take out the Xilinx side or just give you the full quarter of and the little bit of guidance there. It looks like the core AMD is growing low-single digits sequentially.

If you recall, I mean if you think about whether you think about the PC business or the gaming business, they tend to be more second half-weighted, so the second quarter doesn\u2019t tend to be a strong quarter for those businesses and so that\u2019s not the driver of the sequential increase.",

Likewise, the PC market typically sees a stronger second half than the first half. We are anticipating it to be slightly below seasonal trends due to various market factors. Additionally, we expect the Xilinx business to grow in the second half as more supply becomes available to meet strong demand.

We collaborate closely with our customers and have a clear understanding of their demand expectations. Currently, if you evaluate the retail sector, you would notice that demand in the Semi-Custom segment is not fully met, particularly as we gear up for the holiday season. We anticipate that Semi-Custom will reach a record high this year. We have increased content offerings, and the Valve Steam Deck has received excellent reviews and is gaining momentum as we approach the second half of the year. Looking ahead to 2023, I believe it will also be a robust year for Semi-Custom, showing growth. Historically, it\u2019s around the fourth year that we see the business achieve its peak performance. Additionally, considering the upcoming game releases, there is a strong software lineup expected as we move forward. That\u2019s our current perspective on the Semi-Custom business.",

On the GPU side for both training and inference, there, a lot of it is around the software stack and so our focus is on optimizing our software stack with our large cloud customers and partners. And then what Xilinx brings to our portfolio is actually a lot of capability on the AI inference side in their current portfolio and then additive to the AMD portfolio.

          "content": "Thank you, Laura, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. This was an excellent quarter for our business as we delivered record revenue and profitability based on our strong execution, leadership product portfolio, and diversified business model. Each of our segments grew significantly year-over-year, led by higher data center and embedded sales as we continue expanding our presence across a broader set of markets and customers. Revenue grew 70% year-over-year to a record $6.6 billion. We also expanded gross margin 6 percentage points year-over-year to 54% and set records for operating and net income, both of which more than doubled from the prior year. Turning to the business results. Starting in the second quarter, we updated our financial segment reporting to align with our four strategic end markets: Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded. Let me start with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 83% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.5 billion, led by record server processor sales. EPYC processor demand was strong in the quarter, with significant year-over-year growth across both cloud and enterprise customers. In cloud, more than 60 new instances powered by third-gen EPYC processors launched in the quarter from AWS, Baidu, Google, Microsoft Azure, and Oracle, including the industry\u2019s first cloud-based software-as-a-service solution for chip design from Microsoft Azure and Synopsys, powered by our Milan-X processors with 3D stacked triplets. In enterprise, OEM adoption accelerated in the quarter as Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro, Cisco, and others brought tailored solutions to market that deliver leadership performance and TCO across many enterprise workloads. Recent examples include Lenovo\u2019s AMD-powered Think Systems, setting a price performance world record for transaction processing and AMD-based HPE ProLiant servers, delivering record-setting virtualization performance. We made progress further establishing our data center GPU footprint in the quarter, highlighted by the AMD-powered Frontier supercomputer, debuting in the number one spot on both the top 500 list of the world\u2019s fastest supercomputers and the Green500 list of the most energy-efficient supercomputers. I am extremely proud of our work with HPE and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build the world\u2019s first exascale supercomputer. Breaking the exa block barrier is a significant computing milestone, and the fact that it was made possible by EPYC processors and Instinct accelerators highlights AMD\u2019s unique ability to push the envelope in computing further and faster than anyone else. Looking at our broader data center opportunities, we saw strong growth year-over-year for our industry-leading FPGA and networking products with cloud and financial customers. We closed our acquisition of Pensando in the quarter, further expanding our data center solutions capabilities with the addition of a world-class team and an industry-leading DPU and software stack that complement our existing products. With the additions of Xilinx and Pensando, AMD now provides the industry\u2019s broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to enable the best performance, security, flexibility, and TCO for leading-edge data centers. Looking ahead, customer pull for our next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa server CPU is very strong. We are on track to launch and ramp production of Genoa as the industry\u2019s highest performance general-purpose server CPU later this year, positioning our data center business for continued growth and share gains. Turning to our Client segment. Revenue grew 25% year-over-year to $2.2 billion based on record mobile processor sales. We believe we gained client processor revenue share for the ninth straight quarter led by strong adoption of our latest generation Ryzen mobile processors. Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and others are on track to significantly expand their portfolio of AMD-based notebooks as they bring almost 300 new designs to market this year powered by Ryzen processors. We also saw strong demand in the quarter for our latest generation Ryzen Pro processors that deliver leadership performance and battery life for professional notebooks. Commercial client processor revenue grew significantly year-over-year as HP, Lenovo, and others launched more than 50 AMD-based commercial notebooks and Dell announced its first AMD-based precision workstation. Looking ahead, we are on track to launch our all-new 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 desktop processors and AM5 platforms later this quarter, with leadership performance in gaming and content creation. Taking a step back, while there has been additional softness in the PC market in recent months, we believe we are very well positioned to navigate through the current environment based on the strength of our existing product portfolio and upcoming product launches. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue increased 32% year-over-year to $1.7 billion as semi-custom growth more than offset a decline in gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC sales continue outpacing the prior generation, and we remain on track for record semi-custom annual revenue in 2022. Gaming graphics declined in the quarter as macro conditions impacted discretionary spending. New AMD Advantage gaming notebooks that combine Ryzen and Radeon processors to enable outstanding gaming experiences launched recently to strong reviews, highlighted by the Alienware M17 receiving multiple Editors\u2019 Choice awards from leading industry publications. While we expect the gaming graphics market to be down in the third quarter, we remain focused on executing our GPU roadmap, including launching our high-end RDNA 3 GPUs later this year. Our next-generation RDNA 3 architecture is another major step forward for our graphics roadmap, delivering more than a 50% generational improvement in performance per watt by combining our most advanced gaming architecture with 5-nanometer triplet manufacturing. Looking at our Embedded segment, revenue grew significantly year-over-year to $1.3 billion, led by robust demand across all markets and nodes for our FPGA and Adaptive Computing products. Xilinx products are deployed in virtually every market, powering mission-critical applications for thousands of customers. We accelerated Xilinx\u2019s product sales in the second quarter with the benefit of the additional manufacturing scale and resources of AMD. We delivered record core markets revenue led by aerospace and defense, industrial vision, and health and test and measurement. Communications growth was led by higher demand in wired from multiple Tier 1 system vendors, while wireless demand was driven by multiple ramping ORAN deployments in North America. Embedded CPU revenue also grew significantly in the quarter based on higher automotive sales and the ramp of new networking and storage design wins. As we highlighted at our Financial Analyst Day in June, we have identified greater than $10 billion in long-term revenue synergy opportunities as we bring the AMD and Xilinx assets together. Our largest opportunity is in AI, and we have already started executing new hardware and software roadmaps to capture the significant opportunity we see to drive pervasive AI across cloud, edge, and endpoints. In summary, our work over the last several years has placed AMD on a significant growth trajectory. AMD has never been stronger, and the markets for our products have never been as large or diverse. As a result, we have now delivered eight straight quarters of record revenue as our strong execution and leadership products have driven increased adoption across an expanded set of markets and customers. Despite the current macroeconomic environment, we see continued growth in the back half of the year, highlighted by our next-generation 5-nanometer product shipments and supported by our diversified business model. We remain laser-focused on executing our product and technology roadmaps, further deepening our customer relationships and investing strategically across the company to drive our next phase of growth across the $300 billion high-performance and adaptive computing market. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our second quarter financial performance.",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. AMD reported excellent second quarter results. Strong demand for our leadership products drove record quarterly revenue and continued gross margin expansion. The second quarter includes the first full quarter of Xilinx\u2019s financial results, and we are pleased to have closed the acquisition of Pensando in the quarter. Second quarter revenue was $6.6 million, up 70% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue across all segments and the inclusion of Xilinx revenue. Gross margin was 54%, up 640 basis points from a year ago, driven primarily by higher data center and embedded revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $909 million a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income more than doubled from a year ago to record $2.2 billion, driven by significant revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 30%, up from 24% a year ago. Net income was a record $1.7 billion, up $929 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $1.05 per share compared to $0.63 per share a year ago. Now, turning to our reportable segments. As previously communicated, we modified our segment reporting to align with our strategic end markets and the way we now manage the business. The Data Center segment includes server CPUs, data center GPUs, Pensando, and Xilinx data center products. The Client segment includes desktop and notebook PC processors and chipsets, while the Gaming segment includes discrete graphic process and semi-custom game console products. The Embedded segment includes both AMD and Xilinx embedded products. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.5 billion, up 83% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue. Data Center operating income was $472 million or 32% of revenue compared to $204 million or 25% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. Client segment revenue was $2.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year, driven by a richer mix of Ryzen mobile processor sales. Client operating income was $676 million or 32% of revenue compared to $538 million or 31% a year ago. Operating income improvement was driven primarily by higher revenue partially offset by higher operating expenses. Gaming segment revenue was $1.7 billion, up 32% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales. Gaming operating income was $187 million or 11% of revenue compared to $175 million or 14% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by higher semi-custom revenue, which was partially offset by higher operating expenses. Operating margin was lower primarily due to lower graphics revenue and higher operating expenses. Embedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, driven primarily by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $641 million or 51% of revenue compared to $6 million or 11% a year ago, driven by higher revenue. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $6 billion at the end of the second quarter. During the quarter, we deployed $920 million to repurchase common stock and have $7.4 billion in remaining authorization. Cash from operations was a record $1 billion. Quarterly free cash flow was $906 million compared to $888 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $2.6 billion, up approximately $220 million from the prior quarter in support of second-half revenue and the inclusion of Pensando. During the quarter, we established AMD in the investment-grade debt market by issuing debt of $1 billion. Turning to our financial outlook. Today\u2019s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macroeconomic environment and customer demand signals. For the third quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion, plus or minus $200 million, an increase of approximately 55% year-over-year, primarily led by growth in the Data Center and Embedded segments. In addition for Q3 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.64 billion or 24.5% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $270 million based on the 13% effective tax rate, and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. For the full year, we continue to expect revenue of approximately $26.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 60% at the midpoint led by growth in Data Center and Embedded segments. We continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%. In closing, we had an excellent second quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth across all segments, margin expansions, and record profitability. Looking ahead, we remain focused on executing our product and financial objectives, while continuing to monitor market signals and work closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions. We are confident that we are well-positioned for long-term growth driven by our revenue diversification, financial model, and earnings power. Before we transition to the Q&A, we would like to take this opportunity to thank Laura Graves for all her service to AMD and wish her every success on her retirement later this month.

          "content": "Sure. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So in terms of the Q3 and the Q4 guidance, so if we would start first with Q3, I think the Q3 guidance implies that, first of all, the revenue growth is led by the Data Center, as well as some increase in our semi-custom or Game Console business, which historically peaks in the third quarter. We have taken a more conservative outlook on the PC business. So a quarter ago, we would have thought that the PC business would be down, let\u2019s call it, high single digits. And our current view of the PC business is that it will be down, let\u2019s call it, mid-teens. And that\u2019s contemplated into our third quarter guidance. And then as we go into the fourth quarter, what we see is, again, the sequential growth there will be led by the Data Center, as well as our Embedded business, with the same view of the PC business. But what we also have there is a set of new product ramps that we\u2019re very excited about. So we have a number of 5-nanometer products that will be ramping in the fourth quarter, including our client products, as well as our server \u2013 our general products, as well as our graphics products. So that\u2019s sort of the view of Q3 and Q4 from a revenue standpoint. And then from a margin standpoint, again, we\u2019re guiding full year margin at 54%, which is what we \u2013 which is the same. And again, it\u2019s a mix of business in each of the businesses that is resulting in that.",

Given the macro backdrop, we get a bunch of questions from investors about the forward and sort of the concerns related to both enterprise and spending in the cloud. What are your customers telling you at this point? What kind of visibility do you have? And at what point do you become more dependent on the overall market? And I asked the question because if we take the most recent quarter, you\u2019re probably about a third of your nearest competitor in terms of revenue scale, you were about 1.7% a year ago. So obviously, you\u2019re significantly larger, curious at what point do you become more correlated with the broader market? Thank you.",

We\u2019re pleased with the segment growth both on a year-over-year as well as a sequential basis. In terms of what we\u2019re seeing underneath that, in the second quarter, for example, we did see the Cloud business continue to be very strong. So from what we \u2013 from our customers, we\u2019re continuing to ramp new cloud instances and workloads with Milan and we see that continuing into the second half of the year. For the Enterprise business, we actually did make also a good progress on the OEM side there as well. What I would say is the trends there are a bit more mixed and perhaps more correlated to some of the macro backdrop. So we do see a significant pipeline, although some of the deals are taking a little bit longer to close. And I would say that there are some matching set of things that the OEMs are working through. But all in all, I think we continue to see significant growth opportunities as we go into the second half of the year and into 2023 just given our strong product positioning. As I said, in this part of the cycle, we see Milan continuing to ramp into the second half of the year. And then we see Genoa coming in towards the end of the year into 2023. So I do think, to your overall question, do we become more correlated to the market? I mean, I think we are \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly gained a lot of share. So we\u2019re a larger piece of the market, but we are still underrepresented. And the visibility with our customers, especially our large cloud customers\u2019 second half of this year into next year is very good. And we\u2019re planning really for the next four to six quarters, and that gives us good visibility.",

Lisa, I just wanted to revisit the second half outlook because your large competitor recently presented a very bleak picture of PC and Enterprise and Data Center talking about excess inventory, etcetera, but you are leaving your expectations relatively unchanged. I\u2019m curious, how do you see your inventory levels? And do you think AMD could be impacted by any excess PC or server or graphics inventory from your main competitors? Just is your second half you think adequately de-risked the way you see it today?",

So look, if you look at our second half guidance, and maybe let\u2019s talk about the full year guidance, we have \u2013 there are some puts and takes in how we\u2019re seeing the business today. So whenever we guide, we recognize that there are multiple dynamics that we\u2019re looking at. In the current guidance for the full year and the second half, what we\u2019re saying is that we continue to see strong demand in the Data Center, in our Embedded business, as well as in the Console business. And we are being more conservative in our PC outlook. Our PC outlook now at mid-teens would kind of put the market at somewhere around, let\u2019s call it, 290 million to 300 million units. So I do think we\u2019ve appropriately de-risked the PC business. As it relates to inventory as we look at the current situation, given some of the COVID lockdowns and things in the second quarter, I think there was a bit of buildup in PC inventory, and we\u2019ve taken that into account in the second half. We think the AMD portion of that is modest. And as a result, it will rebalance itself in the second half of the year. So overall, I think we feel very good about the second half. And again, with the portfolio that we have, one of the things that has been important is we were still supply constrained in several of the areas. Certainly, on the Embedded side, we were supply constrained in the second quarter. And even on the Server side, we were tight in the second quarter. We have additional supply that\u2019s coming online, especially as we get towards the end of the year. That will help us really meet more of the demand from customers. So we feel pretty good about all of those puts and takes.",

But we see all these media reports about the cloud players wanting to control their spending levels, etcetera. When do you think that shows up in their spending outlook? Or do you think you have enough of a share gain story with Genoa coming out later this year to offset any slowdown from just a broader spending environment perspective?

So, I mean, we spend a lot of time with our customers talking about what they\u2019re seeing in their businesses and what they\u2019re seeing in their markets, particularly the large cloud customers. What I would say is every customer is different. So they each have their own dynamics of what they\u2019re trying to optimize. We have seen a bit of a slowdown in China, and you might have expected that. But certainly, with North America cloud, they\u2019ve been very strong this year, and the forecasts are robust for next year. Relative to your overall question, I think we do feel like we\u2019re in a share gain position. I think the product positioning is such that Milan is very, very strong right now. And we think that Genoa as well is very well positioned into next year. So we\u2019ll always spend time with the customer set and see what they\u2019re seeing. But from our current view, I think we have a strong opportunity to continue to grow the Data Center business into 2023. And our view is we have an expanding portfolio as well. In addition to Genoa, we have our Bergamo, which is a cloud optimized capability as well that\u2019s coming online early next year.

And I guess if that\u2019s the case, it sounds like you were still a little bit supply constrained on server in general in Q2.

We\u2019ve gotten very strong feedback from the customer set. The performance looks very good. There\u2019s a lot of interest to ramp quickly on both the cloud, as well as some of the high-end enterprise stuff. So we feel very good about it. And to your question about supply, we have spent basically the last 12 months building our capacity across the world to support the type of growth that we think the product can handle. So there is a large step-up in supply that we expect to see over the next four, five quarters. And I think we\u2019ll continue to work on that.",

But if I look at it, it\u2019s taken at the dead midpoint; it\u2019s something like a 7% sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 with gross margins going up about 100 bps to 55%. I guess, of that increase, is it fair to say that the bulk of it continues to be Data Center and maybe Embedded? The gross margins to me would suggest that, that's probably the case.

Very pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing there. And then in terms of the margin, it very much is a mix within the business as well. So the pluses and minuses are, yes, Data Center and Embedded are up, but the mix of data center is a little bit more to Cloud than Enterprise, and Embedded a bit more from communications than some of the other markets. But overall, the 7% increase, I think, is very well supported given all of the new product ramps that we have going on in addition to some additional supply that\u2019s coming in as we get into the fourth quarter. And just as a reminder, it\u2019s also a 14-week quarter for us in Q4. And so, all those things give us sort of the implied guide.",

Lisa, I want to dig a little bit into the Gaming business. You obviously have the two parts of that: the client GPUs and the game console side of things. It seems like there are very different dynamics happening there. So when you talked about the \u2013 I believe you said the client GPU side would be down year-over-year in the third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening there? Is that just a reflection of the PC market, or are there any sort of share gains, product issues going on? And then the semi-custom color, you sounded like it\u2019s going to remain strong for the rest of the year. So is there \u2013 is that just the fourth year of the ramp or the third year, I guess, it would be \u2013 or is there some sort of seasonal effect we should appreciate as well?",

          "content": "Yes. Sure, Ross. Thanks for the question. So our Gaming business is the two halves of the sort of the discrete graphics or the consumer graphics and then our Game Console business. So I would say that on the semi-custom side, let\u2019s take that first. The Console business has been very strong. So I would say it\u2019s a strong cycle. Overall, we were more supply constrained in sort of last year into the first half of this year. We\u2019ve been able to get additional supply for that. I think there\u2019s continued belief that it\u2019s a strong cycle for the consoles. We expect consoles to peak in the third quarter, and then the normal seasonality would see a decline in the fourth quarter. As it relates to the consumer graphics, I would say that as we entered this year, we were coming off of a very strong 2021 for consumer graphics where gaming demand was very high. We have seen a slowdown here in the second quarter, and we expect that is somewhat due to sort of demand now \u2013 sort of the supply now and more supply versus demand, as well as some of the macro issues as it relates to consumer spending. We do expect, as we go into the fourth quarter, though, that we\u2019ll see some sequential increase in that business because we\u2019ll have new products that are launching in that timeframe. So those are the puts and takes. I think overall, as a segment, we continue to believe Gaming is a long-term secular driver. There are some sort of short-term dynamics here in the PC market that we\u2019re dealing with. But I think the fact that the Game Consoles have performed so well is a positive for the segment.",

We\u2019re right now sitting probably in the low 40s, and we expect Data Center, in particular, to grow faster than the rest of the company, and that will drive sort of margin expansion. It is \u2013 we\u2019re all working on costs and trying to ensure there are some inflationary kind of costs that are out there. We\u2019re all working on trying to keep those to a minimum.

As we look forward over the next, I mean, you had talked in some of your script about how you guys were preparing for continued growth in the Server business over the next four, six, eight quarters. And the roadmap is going to diversify some next year with Bergamo and Ciena and Genoa X seeming to launch on top of the Genoa platform.

On the enterprise side, as we have always said, it takes a bit longer because the sales cycles are a bit longer. We have made very nice progress with all of the top OEMs. I think the portfolios are continuing to expand. We are excited about not just the current portfolio, as you said, with Genoa, but as we expand to Genoa X at the very high end of the performance as well as Ciena that is a \u2013 that just broadens our portfolio for telco. So, our expectation is that we continue to steadily grow share in the enterprise as well as we go through 2023 and beyond. And I think there is a broader opportunity to sell the broader AMD portfolio.

And the cash taxes get paid. But the timing of the cash taxes sometimes is Q2. And in Q2, we did have some significant cash tax payment from a payment standpoint given the timing of payments of the Federal government. And then you have timing of shipments that does affect the free cash flow. And the last thing I will mention given the discussion, some of the questions that Lisa was asked about, supply for server and supply overall are with the share gain from the growth of the business. We are making investments in capacity from a prepayment standpoint, and those obviously require funding the suppliers, and that also has an impact on the free cash flow because that flows through the free cash flow accretion.

If you were to look on a pro forma basis, the Xilinx portfolio grew about 20% sequentially, which is very nice growth. As we look into the second half of the year, we are still a bit constrained in certain areas, certain parts of the Xilinx portfolio, although we continue to make good progress. And I expect additional supply to come on, especially towards the latter part of the year, into 2023. Our view of the business, again, I think the quality of the design wins and the quality of the overall \u2013 when you look \u2013 the diverse market is very strong.

So, the performance and the sort of the performance per dollar equation is very important there and sort of the power efficiency. As we go into the PC market, we have deliberately focused our PC market on, let\u2019s call it, the more premium segments. So, gaming as well as high-end sort of the ultra-premium, as well as the commercial segments. And again, I think those are much more about the product. There are some parts of the PC market that are very price sensitive, like the low end. And like I said, we have tried to reduce our exposure there going forward.

And if I kind of take a guess about the pro forma contribution of Xilinx, what it would have been in Q1, it\u2019s about 6% share gain. And that would be \u2013 I think that would be the highest share gain in that data center business that you guys ever reported even going back to 2005. Admittedly, two-thirds of that is from Intel declining. I guess since that would put you against Intel, I guess, in the like kind of the mid-20s, and I am curious if you think that math sounds about right to you. And I am hoping that you could because we are grouping more things together, if you could just share with us, was there any outsized contribution from Xilinx or Pensando or something like that and that, that would make that look \u2013 that might change the interpretation from what it looks like on the surface because that\u2019s a pretty big jump in share?",

And obviously, things can change, plus or minus here and there. But overall, I think the ZIP codes of how much growth, how much more content the customers need are very active conversations. And frankly, there have been active conversations for the past few months. I think the one positive of sort of the supply chain stuff that we have all gone through is that there is a new recognition of the need for long-term planning so that they can get their match sets and they can get their factory capacity, and we can get our factory capacity in line as well.

On the ramp of Genoa back half of this year, kind of early next year, I believe the team has a total of around 20-plus SKUs across their cloud, enterprise, and embedded customers. Your cloud customers obviously are anxiously awaiting these platforms. Would you be rolling out your high-volume cloud SKUs first? And what\u2019s the qualification look like on these high-volume SKUs? Just asking because, obviously, your competitor is struggling with SKU releases, and I just want to make sure that the AMD team is executing and releasing its high-volume SKUs to your cloud customers.",

From what we see today, again, there is a strong customer pull on Genoa. And so we are working very closely with our customers, and we expect to ramp production in the fourth quarter and then into the first half of next year.

So, as we look now into the second half of the year, what we are seeing is, again, data center is strong. Again, we expect data center to grow second half to first half nicely. Embedded/Xilinx will also grow to some extent, second half to first half. And the consoles will also grow as well. And so I think as we look at those components offsetting what is perhaps a more conservative PC outlook, we believe that, that offsets nicely. And again, just as a reminder, we do have a number of product ramps in the fourth quarter that are coming out in 5-nanometer, and we think that will drive sort of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter.

          "content": "Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Our third quarter revenue and gross margin came in below our expectations due to softening PC demand and substantial inventory reduction actions across the PC supply chain. Despite the macro backdrop, overall revenue grew 29% year-over-year to $5.6 billion as our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each delivered significant year-over-year growth and performed in line with our expectations. We also expanded gross margin and grew net income year-over-year, highlighting the strength of our business. Turning to the business results, starting with our Data Center segment. Revenue increased 45% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $1.6 billion. We delivered our 10th straight quarter of record server processor sales, driven by strong demand for third-gen EPYC processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Genoa CPU to select customers. Cloud revenue more than doubled year-over-year and increased sequentially as multiple hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal properties and more than 70 new AMD instances were launched by Microsoft Azure, Amazon, Tencent, Baidu and others in the quarter. In enterprise, OEM revenue was down sequentially as server OEMs continued working through match set issues and some business slowed the pace or scale of their purchases based on the macro uncertainties. Looking at the broader competitive landscape, our third-gen EPYC CPUs in market today are the highest performant and most energy efficient x86 server CPUs available, and we expect to further extend that lead with our next-generation 5-nanometer Genoa processors, which deliver significant performance, energy efficiency and TCO advantages for both hyperscale and enterprise workloads. We will publicly launch Genoa next week and are ramping production to support initial cloud deployments and the introduction of fourth-gen EPYC processor platforms by HP Enterprise, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others. Looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, as expected, Data Center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had substantial shipments supporting the build-out of the Frontier exascale supercomputer. We made good progress with our Data Center GPU software enablement work in the quarter, including announcing our role as a founding member of the PyTorch Foundation. We look forward to working closely with the largest cloud providers as we drive a standards based approach to the development of popular PyTorch deep learning software framework. Demand from Data Center customers for our adaptive, SmartNIC and DPU products was strong during the quarter. We had record sales of our Xilinx FPGA and networking Data Center products, led by demand from cloud and financial customers. Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter driven by cloud adoption. The addition of Pensando DPUs to our product portfolio has been very well received by customers, highlighted by our enterprise customer pipeline doubling in the few months since the acquisition closed. We were excited to support VMware\u2019s launch of its next-generation cloud virtualization platform in the quarter. Our Pensando DPUs will be included in the first validated server and HCI solutions, supporting the new VMware virtualization offerings from Dell, HPE and others, that will make it much easier for enterprise customers to build more performant and secure Data Centers powered by our industry-leading DPUs. Taking a step back, we have built significant momentum in our Data Center business as we have consistently executed our server CPU roadmap and expanded our solutions capabilities with the addition of the Xilinx and Pensando products to our portfolio. We remain on track to further expand our product portfolio in 2023 with the launches of our edge and telco optimized Siena and cloud optimized Bergamo processors. With 128 cores and 256 threads per socket, we expect Bergamo will further extend our performance and energy efficiency leadership in cloud workloads. Customer response has been very strong based on the performance, features and software compatibility Bergamo delivers. We believe our broad family of leadership CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs and DPUs position us well for long-term growth and share gains in the Data Center. Now turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 40% year-over-year to $1 billion. Our Client processor shipments were below PC consumption in the third quarter as we worked closely with our customers to reduce downstream inventory. Desktop channel sell-through increased from the prior quarter, driven by increased demand for our Ryzen 5000 Series CPUs and the launch of our Ryzen 7000 Series processors and AM5 platform in September. We launched our 5-nanometer Ryzen 7000 Series processors to strong reviews based on delivering leadership performance in gaming, productivity and content creation applications. We expect Ryzen 7000 CPU sales to ramp this quarter aligned with the launches of a broader range of mainstream and enthusiast AM5 motherboards. Now turning to our Gaming segment, revenue increased 14% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as strong semi-custom sales offset a decline in gaming graphics. We delivered our sixth straight quarter of record semi-custom SoC sales as demand for the latest game consoles remained strong, and Sony and Microsoft prepare for the holiday season. Gaming graphics revenue declined in the quarter based on soft consumer demand and our focus on reducing downstream GPU inventory. We will launch our next-generation RDNA 3 GPUs later this week that combine our most advanced gaming graphics architecture with 5-nanometer chiplet designs. Our high-end RDNA 3 GPUs will deliver strong increases in performance and performance per watt compared to our current products and include new features supporting high resolution, high frame rate gaming. We look forward to sharing more details later this week. Looking at our Embedded segment, revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.3 billion, driven by growth from aerospace and defense, industrial and communications customers. Demand across our core markets remained very strong. We had record sales to aerospace and defense and automotive customers who are increasingly using our FPGA and adaptive SoC products to enable differentiated capabilities and features in their products. Record communications market revenue was driven by growth from both wired and wireless customers. We saw particular strength in North America led by new 5G wireless installations and expanded wired infrastructure deployments. Overall demand for our Xilinx products remains strong as we continue to leverage AMD\u2019s scale to secure additional supply to address this demand. Longer term, we are very excited about the growth opportunities in our Embedded business. We closed multiple high revenue design wins in the quarter with automotive, networking, emulation and prototyping, communications and aerospace and defense customers. We are also seeing new design win opportunities and deeper engagements with many of our Embedded customers based on the expanded breadth of our adaptive SoC, FPGA, CPU, GPU and DPU product portfolio. In summary, we are well-positioned to navigate the current market dynamics based on our leadership product portfolio, strong balance sheet and growth in our Data Center and Embedded segments. We have three clear priorities guiding us. First and foremost, we are focused on executing our road maps and delivering our next generation of leadership products. Second, we are building even deeper relationships with our customers as we make AMD a fundamental enabler of their success. And lastly, we remain very disciplined in how we manage the business. We will continue to invest in our strategic priorities around the Data Center, Embedded and Commercial markets, while tightening expenses across the rest of the business and aligning our supply chain with the current demand outlook. The secular trends driving increased demand for high performance and adaptive computing in the cloud, at the edge and across intelligent end devices remain unchanged and provide a strong backdrop for long-term growth. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Devinder to provide some additional color on our third quarter financial performance. Devinder?",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. AMD reported third quarter results in line with the preliminary results we announced last month. While we are pleased with the performance of our Data Center, Gaming and Embedded segments, each of which grew significantly year-over-year, our third quarter results also reflect lower than expected Client segment revenue. Third quarter revenue was $5.6 billion, up 29% from a year ago. Gross margin was 50%, up 150 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client revenue and $160 million of inventory, pricing and related charges in the graphics and client businesses. Operating expenses were $1.5 billion, compared to $1 billion a year ago as we continue to scale the company. Operating income was up 20% from a year ago to $1.3 billion, driven by revenue growth and higher gross margin. Operating margin was 23%, compared to 24% a year ago, due to higher operating expenses. Net income was $1.1 billion, up $202 million from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.67 per share, compared to $0.73 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower Client segment revenue. Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, up 45% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue. Data Center operating income was $505 million or 31% of revenue, compared to $308 million or 28% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Client segment revenue was $1 billion, down 40% year-over-year, due to reduced process shipments resulting from a weak PC market and a significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $26 million, compared to operating income of $490 million or 29% of revenue a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue. Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up 14% year-over-year, driven by higher semi-custom product sales, partially offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming operating income was $142 million or 9% of revenue, compared to $231 million or 16% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue and inventory pricing and related charges. Embedded segment revenue was $1.3 billion, up $1.2 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx\u2019s embedded product revenue. Embedded operating income was $635 million or 49% of revenue, compared to $23 million or 30% a year ago, driven primarily by higher revenue. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $5.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. During the quarter, we repaid the 7.5% senior notes totaling $312 million that matured in August and deployed $617 million to repurchase common stock. We have $6.8 billion in remaining authorization for stock repurchases. Cash from operations was $965 million and free cash flow was $842 million, compared to $764 million in the same quarter last year. Inventory was $3.4 billion, up approximately $721 million from the prior quarter, driven primarily by client products and new products ramping in the second half of the year. Now turning to our financial outlook, today\u2019s outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the near-term macroeconomic environment. For the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 14% year-over-year and flat sequentially. The year-over-year growth is driven by Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by a decline in the Client and Gaming segments. On a sequential basis, Embedded and Data Center segments are expected to grow, offset by declines in the Client and Gaming segments. In addition, for Q4 2022, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.55 billion or 28% of revenue, non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $175 million based on a 13% effective tax rate, and diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year, we expect revenue to be approximately $23.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 43%, led by growth in the Embedded and Data Center segments. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%. In closing, we continue to focus on executing our long-term strategy, while navigating current market conditions. We will prioritize the key investments for our product roadmaps and long-term growth, while taking several near-term cost management actions, including prudently controlling operating expenses and headcount growth, while actively managing inventory in line with our revenue expectations.

In the short term, we are facing several macro challenges that are impacting all markets, including Data Centers. However, there are differences across segments. North America cloud is the most resilient area within the Data Center market, and this is where AMD excels. We have made significant progress with North American cloud vendors, and while there may be some near-term adjustments in efficiencies at individual cloud providers, we anticipate growth as we move into 2023, especially as customers increase their workloads on AMD due to our strong product portfolio and the upcoming Genoa launch. On the other hand, the situation in China has been weak in 2022, and we don't expect a substantial recovery in 2023. The enterprise sector has also been quite affected by the macro environment, with customers taking longer to make decisions and being more cautious with capital expenditures. Nevertheless, we are confident in our value proposition and product offerings and believe we can gain market share even in a somewhat unstable market.

However, on a year-over-year basis, average selling prices were still higher. We have maintained a disciplined approach to pricing in this environment. During the quarter, we encountered some pricing pressures and avoided unprofitable business, and we will continue to monitor that situation. These were the factors influencing Client average selling prices. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we anticipate a competitive environment due to the ongoing market weakness, and that expectation is reflected in our guidance.",

I would say, we are guiding, let\u2019s call it, modestly down for Client and Gaming, and obviously, we are coming off of what is already a low base in Q3. We want to do that to correct the sort of the inventory situation as quickly as possible, and as a result, we are going to under ship consumption again in the fourth quarter to do that. As it relates to next year, I think, there are a lot of factors. I mean this year PCs will be down quite a bit, let\u2019s call it, high-teens, close to 20%. As we go into next year, I think, the industry is calling mid-single digits. I think that would be a good case. I think we should model down to minus 10%. And again, within our PC business, we expect as we get through this inventory correction, I mean, we have very good products, and I feel very good about our product portfolio and very good about our platforms overall. So I do think the PC business will recover as we go into 2023, but we will have to work through these dynamics over the next quarter or so.",

Adjusting for those charges, the margin for Q3 is roughly 52%. We guided to 54%, but we ended up at 52%, mainly for two reasons: the weak PC market is affecting Client margins. As I mentioned earlier, the rest of the business is expected to perform as planned. We need to navigate the current conditions of the PC market over this quarter, next quarter, and possibly into early 2023 before we can reassess the margins.

Could you help us break down your Data Center business, particularly the strength in cloud, which I expect to continue given the CapEx commentary we've heard? However, it's clear there were some challenges from the enterprise side and from HPC in both CPU and GPU.

Overall, North America cloud remains the strongest segment within our Data Center business, although macro factors are having some impact, notably a slight reduction in capital expenditure. Despite this, our market share in that area is robust, and we anticipate continued growth. As our business shifts more towards cloud solutions, there may be slight downward pressure on margins. However, our current focus is on expanding our presence in both cloud and enterprise sectors. Even amidst a challenging enterprise market in the upcoming quarters, we are confident in our positioning and the platform solutions we are developing with our OEM partners.

We anticipated a weak market, but it turned out to be even weaker than expected, particularly in the consumer sector where we have a significant presence. One notable trend we've observed is that as the broader economy has declined, customers have generally become more cautious. While they have been selling off their inventory, they haven't been restocking to previous levels. Previously, we were in a situation where there was more demand than supply, and in the first half of the year, companies were trying to accumulate inventory. It's a very fluid situation. We have strong partnerships throughout the supply chain and I feel optimistic about our visibility.

However, there were some areas of weakness, particularly in consumer and certain sub-segments of industrial, like test and measurement. Despite these fluctuations, I would say the business shows strong visibility. We are still facing supply constraints in certain nodes, especially some of the legacy nodes, but we've made significant progress in this area. We're expecting additional supply in Q4, which gives us confidence for that quarter. Looking ahead to the first half, we have multiple quarters of visibility thanks to the lead times in this sector, and we will be monitoring it closely.

It\u2019s also for upgrade of, let\u2019s call it, older compute, given our new products have very strong TCO, power efficiency, given the cost of power and energy around the world. We are actually seeing that also be a driver for some of the conversion to AMD in the cloud as we go into 2023.",

We are more underrepresented in enterprise, and so, again, that\u2019s a key focus for us. But as we just stated in the last few questions, I think, North America cloud, in particular, I think, we see line of sight to significant new deployments based on our current roadmap. In the desktop and notebook business, our focus is on certain segments. So we are very focused on premium. We are very focused on gaming and we are focused on commercial. I think in those areas, there are, again, opportunities for us to continue to gain share. I think in desktop DIY business or sort of the desktop channel business, we have a strong lineup.

Regarding the PC business, it is more price-sensitive, and we have noticed it becoming increasingly so. However, where we offer a strong value proposition, we will remain competitive. A year ago, we chose not to compete in the Chrome market because it wasn't profitable for us, and we will be disciplined in ensuring that we pursue profitable business.",

So I am wondering if maybe you can help us with what China is on a consumption basis and kind of how you handicap where your China TAM is going.

And then I think on a medium-term basis, again, my view on these things is, we will always follow the U.S. regulations and understand the need for national security. The majority of our China business is, let\u2019s call it, non-Data Center. So it\u2019s more in the PC business, as well as in some of the consumer facing businesses.

It would seem like those were massively weak months, and I would think that, maybe there\u2019s been some improvement in the run rate when you kind of head into Q4. Does that mean inventory has sort of leaned out a little bit? I mean the market probably only absorbed, I don\u2019t know, 58 million units in Q3, and if you annualize that, you are at 200 million units a year. It\u2019s like hard to get PCs that bad next year.

So the decline was more driven by units, but there was an ASP factor on a sequential basis. And then in terms of what we see in the market, I would say that as the market weakened, there was sort of more pressure at the high end in terms of just velocity and desire to clear inventory. And so the mix did mix towards lower ASPs and towards more incentives to clear that inventory.

Excluding the $160 million in charges we discussed for Q3, we were at about 52%, and we are projecting 51%. The client market remains weak, and we want to ensure that we clear additional inventories. In the Data Center sector, when there is a higher mix for North American cloud, it typically results in lower average selling prices due to the current business environment. Additionally, as Devinder mentioned, as we expand capacity, especially in the server market, there is some extra capacity becoming available, which does have a cost impact.

Regarding market conditions, enterprises are experiencing weakness, and businesses are becoming more cautious. China has been weak all year. In the cloud sector, each customer has unique needs; some are optimizing inventory, others are reducing their footprint, and some are still in the process of expansion. I wouldn't describe this as a unified market, but rather as individual situations for each customer. What's beneficial for us is that our discussions focus not just on Q4 but also on their needs for all of 2023.

          "content": "Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. Before discussing our financial results, I wanted to make a few comments about our CFO transition. I'd like to start by thanking Devinder for all of his contributions to AMD over the last 39 years. During his tenure as CFO, we built a strong financial foundation that has enabled AMD's significant growth and success. On a personal note, his partnership and expertise have been invaluable to me. I know I speak for all of AMD when I say we appreciate all he has done for the company and wish him the best in his upcoming retirement. I also want to welcome our new EVP and CFO, Jean Hu, to our first AMD earnings call since joining us earlier this month. Jean's more than 14 years of public company CFO experience and proven track record of financial leadership make her an excellent addition to our team. I look forward to working closely with her as we continue to transform and scale our business. Now turning to the business results. 2022 was a strong year for AMD as we navigated the challenging macro environment to deliver best-in-class growth and record profitability driven by our Embedded and Data Center segments. We also transformed the company. We accelerated our Data Center business and closed our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, significantly diversifying our business and strengthening our financial model as our Data Center and Embedded product sales grew from $3.9 billion in 2021 to $10.6 billion in 2022. Looking at our financial results, fourth quarter revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $5.6 billion, driven by significant growth in our Embedded and Data Center segments which accounted for more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter. On a full year basis, we grew annual revenue 44% to $23.6 billion. We set annual records for revenue, gross margin and profitability driven largely by a 64% increase in our Data Center segment revenue and the strong performance of our Embedded segment following our Xilinx acquisition. Turning to the fourth quarter business results, starting with our Data Center segment, revenue increased 42% year-over-year to $1.7 billion, led by increased adoption of our EPYC processors by cloud providers. In cloud, sales to North American hyperscalers more than doubled year-over-year as hyperscale customers continued moving more of their internal workloads and external instances to EPYC processors. EPYC processors now power more than 600 publicly available instances globally following the launches of new AMD-based instances from AWS, Microsoft and others in the quarter. In Enterprise, revenue declined year-over-year as demand slowed based on the macro environment. Against this backdrop, we continue expanding our pipeline and closed a number of new wins in the fourth quarter with Fortune 500 financial services, automotive, technology, energy and aerospace companies. In HPC, growing EPYC processor adoption was highlighted by the number of AMD-powered supercomputers on the latest Top 500 list increasing by 38% year-over-year. AMD now powers more than 100 of the world's fastest supercomputers and 15 of the top 20 most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world. To build our Data Center leadership, we launched our fourth gen EPYC processors this past November that deliver up to 2x faster performance in cloud, enterprise and HPC applications, and are up to 80% more energy efficient than the competition's most recently announced offerings. We are seeing very strong customer pull for fourth-gen EPYC CPUs, which complement our third-gen offerings with additional performance and capabilities. Initial cloud deployments are going very well, and we expect to ramp both internal workloads and public instances throughout 2023. For Enterprise, there are more than 140 fourth-gen EPYC platforms in development from HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others, an increase of 40% compared to the prior generation. Now looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, we had record sales of our Xilinx Data Center and networking products in the quarter, led by strong demand from financial services companies for our newly launched Alveo X3 series boards, optimized for low latency trading. Sales of our Pensando DPUs also ramped significantly from the prior quarter, driven by supply chain improvements and continued demand. We are very pleased with the customer reception of the Pensando technology with good long-term growth opportunities as DPUs become a standard component in the next generation of cloud and enterprise data centers. Data center GPU sales were down significantly from a year ago when we had shipments supporting the build-out of multiple Instinct MI250 accelerator supercomputer wins. In January, we previewed our next-generation MI300 accelerator that will be used for large model AI applications in cloud data centers and has been selected to power the 2-plus exaflop El Capitan exascale supercomputer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. MI300 will be the industry's first data center chip that combines a CPU, GPU and memory into a single integrated design, delivering 8x more performance and 5x better efficiency for HPC and AI workloads, compared to our MI250 accelerator currently powering the world's fastest supercomputer. MI300 is on track to begin sampling to lead customers later this quarter and launch in the second half of 2023. Turning to our Client segment. Revenue declined 51% year-over-year to $903 million. We continue to ship below PC consumption in the fourth quarter as we focused on further reducing downstream inventory. While overall PC demand remains soft, desktop channel sell-through increased sequentially during the holiday season. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 7000 series notebook processors earlier in January, including our Ryzen 7040 CPU series that deliver leadership performance in battery life and are our first processors to feature Ryzen AI, the industry's only dedicated on-chip AI inference engine in an x86 processor. Ryzen AI is powered by the highly scalable XDNA architecture, which is the first integration of AMD and Xilinx IP, less than a year after closing the acquisition. We also launched our Ryzen 7045 series CPUs, our first mobile processor based on a triplet design that delivers significantly higher performance than the competition in gaming and content creation applications. We have more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins, spanning our full family of Ryzen 7000 series processors on track to launch this year, an increase of 25% year-over-year with the first notebooks planned to go on sale in February. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 7% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as lower gaming graphics sales more than offset higher semi-custom revenue. Semi-Custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for game consoles remained strong during the holidays. Gaming graphics revenue declined year-over-year as we further reduced desktop GPU downstream channel inventory. Channel sell-through of our Radeon RX GPUs increased sequentially, and we launched our high-end Radeon 7900 series GPUs to strong demand based on the performance of our new RDNA 3 architecture and 5-nanometer chiplet design. In January, we announced our first RDNA 3 mobile GPUs that have been selected to power new gaming notebooks from Dell Alienware, ASUS and others that are on track to begin shipping in the first half of 2023. Looking at our Embedded segment, revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.4 billion. We had record sales across a number of our Embedded markets, including communications, automotive, industrial and healthcare, aerospace and defense, and test and emulation. In communications, we saw particular strength with expanded 5G wireless installations in India and ongoing wired infrastructure deployments with Tier 1 communications providers. Automotive growth was driven by the ramps of new Ford camera, 4D radar and infotainment wins across multiple customers. We recently announced multiple new wins for our automotive grade Zynq UltraScale + platforms with some of the largest vehicle equipment suppliers including Aisin\u2019s next-generation automated parking assist system and DENSO's next-generation LiDAR platform that can improve the resolution required for autonomous driving and other industrial machine vision applications by 20x. We also continued to see strong growth with industrial and health care, aerospace and defense and tested and emulation customers in the quarter, driven by SAM expansion for our leadership-adaptive SoCs, new design win ramps and increased supply across multiple nodes. Taking a step back, as we approach the one year anniversary of the closing of our Xilinx acquisition next month, the integration has gone extremely well, and our Embedded business has become a major growth driver for AMD, strengthening our financial model and significantly diversifying our business. In addition, we are seeing substantial new revenue synergy opportunities as we combine Xilinx's industry-leading adaptive products and 6,000-plus customers with AMD's expanded breadth of compute products and scale. In summary, overall, 2022 was a strong year for AMD despite the weak PC market. We significantly grew our Data Center, Embedded and Gaming businesses and executed well across our product portfolio. As we enter 2023, we expect the overall demand environment to remain mixed with the second half stronger than the first half. In the PC market, we are planning for the PC Total Addressable Market (TAM) to be down approximately 10% for 2023. We expect to continue to ship below consumption in the first quarter to reduce downstream inventory, which is reflected in our guidance. In our Embedded and Data Center segments, we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and gain share in 2023 based on the strength of our competitive positioning and leadership high-performance and adaptive product portfolio. We do see elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers, which will lead to a softer first half and a stronger second half of the year. We continue working very closely with our customers to navigate the dynamic market conditions while also making the right strategic investments to exit the current cycle with an even stronger and more differentiated set of products to drive future growth. Over the next several years, one of our largest growth opportunities is in AI, which is in the early stages of transforming virtually every industry service and product. We expect AI adoption will accelerate significantly over the coming years and are incredibly excited about leveraging our broad portfolio of CPUs, GPUs and adaptive accelerators in combination with our software expertise to deliver differentiated solutions that can address the full spectrum of AI needs in training and inference across cloud, edge and client. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Jean?",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. 2022 was a very strong year for AMD. We had record revenue, gross margin, profitability, and we generated significant free cash flow. The year was also highlighted by our strategic acquisitions of Xilinx and Pensando, expanding and diversifying our business portfolio. Fourth quarter 2022 revenue for $5.6 billion was up 16% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in the Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client and the Gaming segment revenue. Gross margin was 51%, up 70 basis points from a year ago, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue in Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion compared to $1.1 billion a year ago, driven by the inclusion of Xilinx operational expenses and additional R&D and go-to-market investments to support the next phase of our revenue growth. Operating income declined $66 million from a year ago to $1.3 billion, and the operating margin was 23%, down from 27% a year ago. Net income was $1.1 billion flat year-over-year. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69 compared to $0.92 per share a year ago, primarily due to lower client operating income. Now turning to our reportable segment for the fourth quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment. Revenue was $1.7 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by strong growth in third-generation EPYC server processor revenue and the early ramp of fourth-generation EPYC processors. Data center operating income was $444 million or 27% of revenue compared to $360 million or 32% a year ago. Higher operating income was driven primarily by stronger revenue, partially offset by higher R&D investment to support the top line revenue growth. Client segment revenue was $903 million, down 51% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipments resulting from a weak PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. Client operating loss was $152 million compared to operating income of $530 million a year ago or 29% of revenue, primarily due to lower revenue. Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 7% year-over-year due to lower gaming graphics revenue, partially offset by higher semi-custom product sales. Gaming operating income was $266 million or 16% of revenue compared to $407 million or 23% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower graphics revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up $1.3 billion from a year ago, primarily due to the inclusion of Xilinx Embedded revenue. Embedded operating income was $699 million or 50% of revenue compared to $18 million or 25% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of Xilinx. Turning to the balance sheet, we have a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $5.9 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During the quarter, we returned $250 million to shareholders through share repurchases. In 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders which was 119% of free cash flow. We have $6.5 billion in remaining authorization for share repurchases. Free cash flow was $443 million compared to $736 million in the same quarter last year. Free cash flow decreased primarily due to higher inventory. Inventory was $3.8 billion, up approximately $402 million from the prior quarter, primarily driven by the inventory increase in advanced process nodes to support the ramp of new products. Now let me turn to our full year financial results. 2022 revenue was $23.6 billion, up 44% year-over-year, driven by increased Embedded, Data Center and the Gaming segment revenue, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. On our combined AMD and Xilinx company basis, 2022 pro forma revenue was $24.1 billion, up 20% compared to $20.1 billion in 2021. Gross margin was 52%, up 370 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by richer product mix with higher revenue from Embedded and Data Center segments, partially offset by lower Client segment revenue. Operating expenses were 26% of revenue compared to 24% in 2021. 2022 operating income was $6.3 billion, up $2.3 billion, an increase of 56% from a year ago resulting in operating margin of 27% compared to 25% in 2021, primarily driven by higher revenue and gross margin expansion. Net income was $5.5 billion compared to $3.4 billion, up 60% from the prior year. Earnings per share was $3.50 compared to $2.79 for the prior year, primarily due to Data Center growth and the addition of Xilinx. Full year free cash flow was $3.1 billion, resulting in free cash flow margin of 13% for the year. We invested approximately $1 billion in long-term supply chain capacity in 2022 to support our expectations for future revenue growth and increase market share. Let me now turn to our financial outlook. Today's outlook is based on current expectations and contemplates the current macro environment. For the first quarter of 2023, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 10% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year Data Center and Embedded segment revenue are expected to grow, offset by lower Client and Gaming segment revenue. Sequentially, Embedded segment revenue is expected to increase. Client and Gaming segment revenue are expected to decline largely consistent with seasonality. Data Center segment revenue is expected to decline due to elevated levels of inventory with some cloud customers. In addition, for Q1 2023, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%; non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion; non-GAAP interest expense, taxes and other to be approximately $146 million based on a 13% effective tax rate. Diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. For the full year of 2023, we are not providing specific guidance due to the uncertainty in the macro environment. However, let me provide some color. Directionally, we expect Embedded and Data Center annual revenue to grow from 2022 based on the strength of our product portfolio and expected share gains. In addition, we expect Client and the Gaming segment revenue to decline based on the current demand environment. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately flattish in the first half and the expansion in the second half of the year. We expect to manage quarterly non-GAAP operating expenses flat with the fourth quarter until we see the demand environment improve. For modeling purposes, we expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be 13% and the diluted share count to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. In closing, we had a strong year with record revenue and profitability, driven by our leadership in product portfolio and the diversification of our business. Looking forward to 2023, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll continue to focus on executing our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence. We believe our leadership of products, growing customer momentum and strong financial foundation position us well for long-term profitable growth. With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for a Q&A session.",

But I remember all the work you and your finance team did six or seven years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement? My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023? You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of going on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the Data Center space and obviously what's going on in the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year 2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year? Thanks.",

          "content": "Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Our largest growth driver is certainly the Data Center. We are well positioned with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa fourth gen EPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well. When we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our roadmap. And we have an opportunity to move more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so, we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with Data Center. Also on the embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's a diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so, we think that's also a grower for AMD. On the other side, our Client and Gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in the second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory. And I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to ship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity for growth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, Client will decline just given the TAM. And then on the Gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022. And so console demand has been quite strong. And given where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, I think lots of puts and takes, but we're positive on what we can do in terms of the Data Center and the embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on the Client and Gaming and see how that plays out.",

The margin, I guess, sequentially down a little bit into March. But I kind of wanted to focus on the drivers of the longer-term margin that's down, I guess, three or four points from where you were a few quarters ago despite more mix of the revenue coming from Embedded and Data Center? So if there's any way that you guys could try to quantify maybe how much of the margin headwind is from just lower client revenue? How much of it might be from any programs that you're working through to clear the channel? And how might we model? What are the drivers that we should think about in terms of the margin recovering?

So as the Embedded and Data Center businesses grow, so the margin expansion grows with it. In terms of the sequential question that you had from Q4 to Q1, that's just a product of the mix. So with Data Center being lower sequentially, that's that. We are also working through our client inventory clearing. What we're seeing in the PC business is, as we're going through this sort of normalization of inventory, especially on some of the older products, we do have more marketing programs and pricing incentives in place. We do expect that to normalize as we go through the first half of the year. And so as Jean said in the prepared remarks, we would expect margin expansion as we go into the second half with the growth in Data Center, Embedded and some normalization of the client business as well.",

Is it a 2-quarter issue? Does it impact the pace of your Genoa ramp because I think coming into this year, the expectations were you could grow server sales by over 20%?

In terms of where we believe the - as the inventory normalizes, each customer is different, so they have what they're trying to achieve in terms of inventory levels. Our expectation is that sort of the first half softness for cloud and then second half strength as that's worked through. But like I said, it's different for each customer. And then in terms of overall growth, as I said, we're very bullish on the overall growth of our Data Center business and the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year.

But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, year-on-year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one? Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering? And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers?",

So my comment about PC TAM being down 10% was assuming, if you take a look at sort of what IDC just published for - in 2022 at about 290 million units, and that's more of a sell-through TAM versus a sell-in TAM. So we have been under shipping sort of the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters in an attempt to renormalize that as soon as possible. In terms of do I think it's conservative? I think it's in the ZIP code. I think it's in the ZIP code. So if you imagine 2023 sell-through TAM of about 260 million units, plus or minus, seems to be about the right number. We have made good progress in inventory normalization. We want to be cautious, obviously, heading into the year just given the macro environment. First quarter, we said would be roughly seasonal for PCs. I think the second quarter - first quarter should be the bottom for us in PCs. We - and then grow from there into the second quarter and then into the second half. And I should note also, Vivek, I mean, we just launched our Ryzen 7000 Series with sort of our AI capabilities, both from a notebook and desktop standpoint. So, we feel good about the product roadmap in PCs. Obviously, we have to get through this normalization.

So we feel pretty good about the second half. We continue to have the growth of both Embedded and Data Center segments. The major headwind we are facing is really Client side, which if you think about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction, which impacts the gross margin in the Client segment. So going into the second half, the normalization of the Client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the Client segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall, we feel pretty good.

As we go into the second half of the year and launch MI300, sort of the first user of MI300 will be the supercomputers or El Capitan, but we're working closely with some large cloud vendors as well to qualify MI300 in AI workloads.

And then as a quick follow-up, the business doesn't really ask that much about, but it's been doing phenomenally well here these last couple of quarters. It's actually the Xilinx business. I know it's within the Embedded largely. But your self-reporting, I think if I read the filings correctly, growing 40% plus on a like-for-like basis for Xilinx. I think your competitor also growing at a solid pace. How do you think about the sustainability or durability of that demand in that Embedded or Xilinx business as we move through '23?",

When we look across the subsegments, there are puts and takes in the subsegments. But what we see is content is going up. So we had records in communications, industrial and health care, aerospace and defense, automotive. We have the Embedded processor content that's also going into automotive. So we feel very good about that business. I think as we look into 2023, I mentioned this in the question with Stacy. We have a very good visibility to the first half just given the lead times and the backlog. And the first half looks strong, so we expect to grow sequentially in the first quarter. As we go into the second half of the year, we're monitoring the overall demand environment. And just given how strong it's been, we are looking at whether there'll be some puts and takes in some of the end market segments there. But overall, I think the key point is the content, and our design win momentum is good, and we continue to ramp new design wins in the Xilinx business.",

Joe, we view that the opportunity - so first of all, I would say that in general, the PC market share numbers are probably a bit noisy right now, just given all of the sell-in, sell-through, and the inventory dynamics that are being worked through. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we believe we gained a little bit of share in the PC market. As we go forward into 2023, we think our product portfolio is very strong. As we look at Ryzen 7000 and where it goes and where we are positioned in the commercial as well as the high-end consumer segments, we're not changing our strategy on PCs. Quite a few years ago, we really focused on sort of the more premium segments. We have less penetration in the low end, which I think is helpful. And as we go forward, we're continuing to focus on commercial PCs and getting a larger footprint in there. I will say the enterprise work that we're doing on the server side, I think, links very well to the commercial PC work, and we're continuing to invest in sort of the sales and marketing resources to ramp that side of the business.",

So I wouldn't say that that's necessarily slowing the pace of adoption. It is a new platform though. So if you think about when we went from Rome to Milan, it was basically similar platforms. So I would say that that ramp was a bit faster. But as it relates to Genoa, we had always expected that Milan and Genoa would coexist through 2023. And that we would have - we still have Milan instances that are just ramping now, and we expect that will continue through 2023. And so I really view this as the natural thing when we introduce Genoa at sort of the higher core count, that both will coexist. And as some of the platform costs come down, you'll see the Genoa cutover, and that's what I mentioned towards the fourth quarter of 2023.",

On one hand, I could see that the total cost of ownership benefits of these products, multicore, better performance, et cetera, could lead to higher ASPs, whether you're talking about the Data Center side or your Client business. On the other side, competitive intensity and overall demand is weaker. And at some point, you might even get deflationary costs on the foundry side of things.

The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that we bring to both cloud and enterprise customers. I think on the client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think that normally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing our OEM partners are working on rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so, there are more incentives and a more aggressive pricing environment. I view that as primarily on, let's call it, older products, let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that, there will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products where there's more capability added. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes. And in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see - expect that to normalize too as everyone is sort of optimizing their CapEx spending.",

And Lisa, correct me if I am wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client, but just to grow into second quarter.

So I think you can infer that from our guidance single-digit down. And then we'll be back to a more normal environment.

I think the Data Center business we have, you know again, we're heavily weighted towards cloud. And we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favor in the Data Center is our workloads are expanding. And so, we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting both Milan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so I think that gives us good confidence. And frankly, the Data Center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023. So there is an adjustment in the first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up production in the second half as some of the demand resumes.

As I said, I think we've made good progress on that. And I think we have much better visibility into the various pieces. As it relates to the pricing environment, I do believe that the pricing environment is - particularly when you're clearing older inventory or older generation products, is a bit more competitive. And we see that. As we look forward, the way we're modeling the client business is that we are modeling gross margins to be less than corporate average. That's different than our previous modeling. So previously, client was more like at corporate average. And I think given the - I think the nice thing is our business is quite a bit more diversified now. And so with our Data Center, Embedded businesses really being strong growth drivers, I think Client continues to be a good market overall.

          "content": "Thank you, Ruth, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed very well in the first quarter as we delivered better-than-expected revenue and earnings in a mixed demand environment, launched multiple leadership products across our businesses, and made significant progress accelerating our AI roadmap and customer engagements across our portfolio. First quarter revenue was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year. Sales of our data center and embedded products contributed more than 50% of overall revenue in the quarter as cloud and embedded revenue grew significantly year-over-year. Looking at the first quarter business results, Data Center segment revenue of $1.3 billion was flat year-over-year with higher cloud sales offset by lower enterprise sales. In cloud, the quarter played out largely as we expected. EPYC CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year but declined sequentially as elevated inventory levels with some MDC customers resulted in a lower sell-in TAM for the quarter. Against this backdrop, we were pleased that the largest cloud providers further expanded their AMD deployments in the quarter to power a larger portion of their internal workloads and public instances. 28 new AMD instances launched in the first quarter, including multiple confidential computing offerings from Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and Oracle Cloud that take advantage of the unique security features of our EPYC processors. In total, we now have more than 640 AMD-powered public instances available. Enterprise sales declined year-over-year and sequentially as end customer demand softened due to near-term macroeconomic uncertainty. We continued growing our enterprise pipeline and closed multiple wins with Fortune 500 automotive, technology, and financial companies in the quarter. We made strong progress in the quarter, ramping our Zen 4 EPYC CPU portfolio. All of our large cloud customers have Genoa running in their data centers and are on track to begin broad deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances in the second quarter. For the enterprise, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro, and other leading providers entered production on new Genoa server platforms that complement their existing third-gen EPYC platforms. We are on track to launch Bergamo, our first cloud-native server CPU and Genoa-X, our fourth Gen EPYC processor with 3D chiplets for leadership in technical computing workloads later this quarter. Although we expect server demand to remain mixed in the second quarter, we are well positioned to grow our cloud and enterprise footprint in the second half of the year based on the strong customer response to the performance and TCO advantages of Genoa, Bergamo, and Genoa-X. Now looking at our broader data center business. In networking, Microsoft Azure launched their first instance powered by our Pensando DPU and software stack that can significantly increase application performance for networking-intensive workloads by enabling 10x more connections per second compared to non-accelerated instances. We expanded our data center product portfolio with the launch of our first ASIC-based Alveo data center media accelerator that supports 4x the number of simultaneous video streams compared to our prior generation. In supercomputing, the Max Planck Society announced plans to build the first supercomputer in the EU powered by fourth-gen EPYC CPUs and Instinct MI300 accelerators that is expected to deliver a 3x increase in application performance and significant TCO improvements compared to their current system. Our AI activities increased significantly in the first quarter, driven by expanded engagements with a broad set of data center and embedded customers. We expanded the software ecosystem support for our Instinct GPUs in the first quarter, highlighted by the launch of the widely used PyTorch 2.0 framework, which now offers native support for our ROCm software. In early April, researchers announced they used the LUMI supercomputer powered by third-gen EPYC CPUs and Instinct MI250 accelerators to train the largest Finnish language model to date. Customer interest has increased significantly for our next-generation Instinct MI300 GPUs for both AI training and inference of large language models. We made excellent progress achieving key MI300 silicon and software readiness milestones in the quarter, and we're on track to launch MI300 later this year to support the El Capitan Exascale supercomputer win at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and large cloud AI customers. To execute our broad AI strategy and significantly accelerate this key part of our business, we brought together multiple AI teams from across the company into a single organization under Victor Peng. The new AI group has responsibility for owning our end-to-end AI hardware strategy and driving the development of a complete software ecosystem, including optimized libraries, models, and frameworks spanning our full product portfolio. Now turning to our client segment. Revenue declined 65% year-over-year to $739 million as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. As we stated on our last earnings call, we believe the first quarter was the bottom for our client processor business. We expanded our leadership desktop and notebook processor portfolio significantly in the quarter. In desktops, we launched the industry's fastest gaming processors with our Ryzen 7000 X3D series CPUs that combine our Zen 4 core with industry-leading 3D chiplet packaging technology. In mobile, the first notebooks powered by our Dragon Range CPUs launched to strong demand, with multiple third-party reviews highlighting how our 16 core Ryzen 9 7945HX CPU is now the fastest mobile processor available. We also ramped production of our Zen 4-based Phoenix Ryzen 7040 series CPUs in the first quarter for ultrathin and gaming notebooks to support the more than 250 ultrathin gaming and commercial notebook design wins on track to launch this year from Acer, Asus, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Looking at the year, we continue to expect the PC TAM to be down approximately 10% for 2023 to approximately 260 million units. Based on the strength of our product portfolio, we expect our client CPU sales to grow in the second quarter and in the seasonally stronger second half of the year. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 6% year-over-year to $1.8 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was offset by lower gaming graphics sales. Semi-custom SoC revenue grew year-over-year as demand for premium consoles remains strong following the holiday cycle. In gaming graphics, channel sell-through of our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs increased sequentially. We saw strong sales of our high-end Radeon 7900 XTX GPUs in the first quarter, and we're on track to expand our RDNA 3 GPU portfolio with the launch of new mainstream Radeon 7000 series GPUs this quarter. Looking at our Embedded segment. Revenue increased significantly year-over-year to a record $1.6 billion. We saw strength across the majority of our embedded markets, led by increased demand from industrial, vision and health care, test and emulation, communications, aerospace and defense, and automotive customers. Demand for our adaptive computing solutions continues to grow as industrial vision and health care customers actively work to add more advanced compute capabilities across their product lines. We also released new Vitis AI software libraries to enable advanced visualization and AI capabilities for our medical customers and launched our next-generation Kria platform that provides a turnkey solution to deploy our leadership adaptive computing capabilities for smart camera, industrial, and machine vision applications. In Communications, we saw strength with wired customers as new infrastructure design wins ramped into production. We also launched Zynq RFSoC products to accelerate 4G and 5G radio deployments in cost-sensitive markets and formed our first telco solutions lab to validate end-to-end solutions based on AMD CPUs, adaptive SoCs, FPGAs, DPUs, and software. In automotive, deployments of our adaptive silicon solutions for high-end ADAS and AI features grew in the quarter, highlighted by Subaru rolling out its AMD-based EyeSight 4 platform across their full range of vehicles. In addition, we expanded our embedded processor portfolio with the launches of Ryzen 5000 and EPYC 9000 embedded series processors with leadership performance and efficiency as we focus on growing share in the security, storage, edge server, and networking markets. Looking more broadly across our embedded business, we are making great progress in bringing together our expanded portfolio and scale to drive deeper engagements with our largest embedded customers. In summary, I'm pleased with our operational and financial performance in the first quarter. In the near term, we continue to see a mixed demand environment based on the uncertainties in the macro environment. Based on customer demand signals, we expect second-quarter revenue will be flattish sequentially, with growth in our client and data center segments, offset by modest declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments. We remain confident in our ability to grow in the second half of the year, driven by the adoption of our Zen 4 product portfolio, improving demand trends in our client business, and the early ramp of our Instinct MI300 accelerators for HPC and AI. Looking longer term, we have significant growth opportunities ahead based on successfully delivering our road maps and executing our strategic data center and embedded priorities, led by accelerating adoption of our AI products. We are in the very early stages of the AI computing era, and the rate of adoption and growth is faster than any other technology in recent history. And as the recent interest in generative AI highlights, bringing the benefits of large language models and other AI capabilities to cloud, edge, and endpoints require significant increases in compute performance. AMD is very well positioned to capitalize on this increased demand for compute based on our broad portfolio of high-performance and adaptive compute engines, the deep relationships we have established with customers across a diverse set of large markets, and our expanding software capabilities. We are very excited about our opportunity in AI. This is our #1 strategic priority, and we are engaging deeply across our customer set to bring joint solutions to the market, led by our upcoming Instinct MI300 GPUs, Ryzen 7040 Series CPUs with Ryzen AI, Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoCs, LVO V70 data center inference accelerators, and Versal AI adaptive data center and edge SoCs. I look forward to sharing more about our AI progress over the coming quarters as we broaden our portfolio and grow this strategic part of our business. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first-quarter results. Jean?",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. As a reminder, for comparative purposes, first-quarter 2022 results included only partial quarter financial results from the acquisition of Xilinx, which closed in February 2022. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $5.4 billion, a decrease of 9% year-over-year as Embedded segment strength was offset by lower Client segment revenue. Gross margin was 50%, down 2.7 percentage points from a year ago, primarily impacted by Client segment performance. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion, increasing 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the inclusion of a full quarter of expenses from Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $739 million year-over-year, and the operating margin was 21%. Interest expense, taxes, and other was $128 million. For the first quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.60 due to better-than-expected revenue and operating expenses. Now turning to our reportable segment for the first quarter. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, flat year-over-year, driven primarily by higher sales of EPYC processors to cloud customers, offset by lower enterprise server processor sales. Data Center segment operating income was $148 million or 11% of revenue compared to $427 million or 33% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to product mix and increased R&D investments to address large opportunities ahead of us. Client segment revenue was $739 million, down 65% year-over-year as we shipped significantly below consumption to reduce downstream inventory. We expect an improvement in second-quarter Client segment revenue and a seasonally stronger second half. Client segment operating loss was $172 million compared to an operating income of $692 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue. Gaming segment revenue was $1.8 billion, down 6% year-over-year. Semi-custom revenue grew double-digit percentages year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. Gaming segment operating income was $314 million or 18% of revenue compared to $358 million or 19% a year ago. The decrease was primarily due to lower gaming graphics revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.6 billion, up $967 million year-over-year, primarily due to a full quarter of Xilinx revenue and the strong performance across multiple end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $798 million or 51% of revenue compared to $277 million or 46% a year ago, primarily driven by the inclusion of a full quarter of Xilinx. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $486 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong financial model despite the mixed demand environment. Free cash flow was $328 million. In the first quarter, we increased inventory by $464 million, primarily in anticipation of the ramp of new Data Center and Client product in advanced process nodes. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $5.9 billion, and we returned $241 million to shareholders through share repurchases. We have $6.3 billion in remaining authorization for share repurchases. In summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the AMD team executed very well, delivering better-than-expected top-line revenue and earnings. Now turning to our second quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.3 billion, plus or minus $300 million, a decrease of approximately 19% year-over-year and approximately flat sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect the Client, Gaming, and Data Center segments to decline, partially offset by Embedded segment growth. Sequentially, we expect Client and Data Center segment growth to be offset by modest Gaming and Embedded segment decline. In addition, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 50%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.6 billion. Effective tax rate to be 13%. And the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.62 billion shares. In closing, I'm pleased with our strong top-line and bottom-line execution. We have a very strong financial model, and we'll continue to invest in our long-term strategic priorities, including accelerating our AI offerings to drive sustainable value creation over the long term. With that, I'll turn it back to Ruth for the Q&A session.",

In the first half of the year, some of the larger cloud customers are dealing with inventory and optimization issues, along with a challenging enterprise market. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we observe several positive indicators. Our product roadmap is robust, and we are receiving favorable feedback from customers regarding Genoa, which is progressing well and stands out in terms of total cost of ownership and overall performance. We believe it is well-positioned for success. The initiatives we undertook in the first half of the year were aimed at ensuring we can support a wider range of workloads as we advance into the second half. From a market perspective, we anticipate a mixed performance in the enterprise segment, but we do expect some improvements, contingent on the macroeconomic conditions. Additionally, alongside Genoa, we are also preparing to launch Bergamo, which is on schedule for release in the second quarter and will ramp up in the second half. By the end of the year, we will also start increasing production of our MI300 GPU. This means we are set to ramp our supercomputing projects as well as our early cloud AI initiatives in the fourth quarter. There are many factors at play, and while we need to observe how the year unfolds, we feel optimistic about our product positioning and roadmap for the Data Center.",

In the conversations that we're having with customers, I think they're enthusiastic about Zen 4 and what it can bring into cloud workloads as well as enterprise workloads. I think actually Genoa is extremely well positioned for enterprise where we have been underrepresented. So we feel good about the roadmap.

Our thought process for sort of modest decline into Q2 is that we did have a bunch of backlog that we're in the process of clearing, and that backlog will clear in Q2, and then we expect that the growth will moderate a bit. We still very much like the positioning of sort of our aerospace and defense, our industrial, our test and emulation business, and our automotive business. We expect wireless trends to be a little bit weaker as well as consumer trends. So those are the kind of the puts and takes in the market.

In evaluating our performance in the first half and the guidance for the second quarter, we are quite satisfied with the strong gross margins in both the Data Center and embedded segments. We have not experienced any negative impacts on our gross margin from the Client segment. Looking ahead to the second half, we anticipate an improvement in gross margin as the Data Center segment grows and Embedded remains robust. The extent of this improvement will mostly depend on the recovery of the Client segment. We expect that the gross margin for the Client segment will also improve, but it will still fall short of the corporate average. Thus, the rate of gross margin improvement may hinge on the Client business recovery in the latter half of the year. However, in the long run, we believe the most significant growth opportunities for revenue will be in the Data Center and Embedded segments, which gives us confidence that our gross margin will continue to increase over time.",

So it is the new DDR5, it's PCI Gen 5. And for many of our top customers, they're also doing other things other than upgrading the CPUs. So from that standpoint, I would say the ramp is going about as we expected. We've seen a lot of interest, a lot of customer engineering work that we're doing together in the data centers with our customers, and we feel great about the set of workloads, and we see expansion in the workloads going forward. So overall, our expectation is, particularly as we go into the second half, we'll see Genoa ramp more broadly.

AI for us is broader than cloud. I mean it also includes what we're doing in Clients and Embedded. But specifically, as it relates to MI300, MI300 is actually very well positioned for both HPC or supercomputing workloads as well as for AI workloads. And with the recent interest in generative AI, I would say the pipeline for MI300 has expanded considerably over the last few months, and we're excited about that. We're putting a lot more resources, I mentioned on the prepared remarks, the work that we're doing, sort of taking our Xilinx and sort of the overall AMD AI efforts and collapsing them into one organization, that's primarily to accelerate our AI software work as well as platform work.

So I feel that we have good visibility. Obviously, some of this is still dependent on overall macro situation and overall demand. But our view is that there is a lot of good progress in the Data Center. Now in terms of quantification, as I said, there's a lot of puts and takes. My view is that enterprise will improve as we go into the second half, and we're seeing some very early signs of improvement in China as well. So our view is, I think, double-digit Data Center growth is what we currently see.

And then we also believe that the Client market is stabilizing. So Q1 was the bottom for our business as well as for the overall market. From what we see although it will be a gradual set of improvements, we do see that the overall market should be better in the second half of the year. We like our product portfolio a lot. I'm excited about having AI-enabled on our Ryzen 7000 series. And we have leadership notebook platforms with Dragon Range. Our desktop roadmap is also quite strong with the new launch of the Ryzen 7000 X3D products. And so I think here in the second quarter, we'll still undership consumption a bit.

I think the customers are very open to that. I think we have a sales force and a go-to-market capability across this customer set that is very helpful for that. So I do believe that this is a long-term opportunity for us to continue to grow our embedded business.

In terms of generative AI, we believe we offer a strong value proposition from a hardware perspective, particularly in terms of performance relative to cost, which indicates high market demand.

The beauty of particularly the cloud opportunity is it's not that many customers, and it's not that many workloads.

And so what the headwinds that impact our gross margin is really PC Client side, which, as we talked about, is we are shipping significantly under the consumption and also to digest inventory in the downstream supply chain. As you know, typically, that's the time you get a significant pressure on the ASP side and on the funding side. That's why our gross margin in the Client segment has been challenged. In the second half, we know it's going to be normalized. That's a very important fact is when you normalize the demand and supply, and we continue to plan a very competitive environment, so don't get us wrong on that front. But it will be better because you are not digesting the inventory, the channel funding, everything, those kinds of price reductions will be much less.

If you compare year-over-year, you're correct that revenue has remained largely flat, but there has been a significant drop in operating margin. There are two primary factors contributing to this.

As you may recall, we finalized the acquisition of Pensando last May or June, which means this quarter reflects the full expenses of Pensando compared to last year. Additionally, we have increased our GPU investment linked to AI, all classified under the Data Center category. The second factor is the product mix. As Lisa mentioned, year-over-year cloud sales experienced significant double-digit growth, while enterprise sales actually declined. In Q1, our data center revenue heavily relies on the cloud market compared to last year. Typically, the gross margin for cloud is lower than that of enterprise.

          "content": "Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the second quarter, launching multiple leadership products, significantly expanding our AI engagements, and ramping our latest Zen 4, EPYC, and Ryzen product families. Second quarter revenue declined 18% year-over-year, to $5.4 billion. Sales were flat sequentially as Client and Datacenter segment growth was offset by expected declines in our Gaming and Embedded Segments. AI cluster engagements grew by more than seven times sequentially as multiple customers initiated or expanded programs supporting future deployments of Instinct MI250 and MI300 hardware and software at scale. Looking at the second quarter business results, Datacenter segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 11% year-over-year, and up 2% sequentially. Although market demand remains mixed, the 4th Gen EPYC CPU adoption accelerated in the quarter, with revenue nearly doubling sequentially as cloud providers expanded deployments to power their internal infrastructure and public instance offerings. In cloud, 30 new AMD instances launched in the second quarter, with multiple Genoa instances announced by AWS, Alibaba, Microsoft, and Oracle. Genoa delivers up to 1.9 times more performance in enterprise and cloud applications, and 1.8 times more performance per watt than the competition, making it, by far, the industry's highest performance and most efficient server processor. As an example, AWS announced its M7a Genoa instance, which is the highest performance and best price-performance general-purpose x86 instance they offer. In total, there are now more than 670 AMD-powered cloud instances publicly available, and we expect that number to grow 30%, to nearly 900 by the end of the year, driven largely by new Genoa deployments. We also expanded our Zen 4 server product portfolio in the quarter with the launches of Bergamo and Genoa-X. Microsoft Azure announced the first Genoa-X HPC instances that offer more than five times higher performance in technical computing workloads compared to their prior generation. With Bergamo, we deliver more than double the performance than competitive offerings for cloud-native applications while offering full x86 software compatibility. We were excited to be joined at our launch event by Meta, where they announced plans to deploy Bergamo broadly across their global data center infrastructure to power applications, including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Looking ahead, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro, and other large server providers are on track to begin launching their new Bergamo platforms in the third quarter. In enterprise, while macroeconomic uncertainty resulted in weaker customer demand year-over-year, sales of EPYC processors for enterprise servers grew sequentially as we closed multiple wins with large energy, technology, financial services, and healthcare companies. Overall, pull from large enterprises continued to grow. For example, Banco de Brasil, BNP Paribas, Petronas, Uber, and other large enterprises, all adopted EPYC processors in the quarter. And SAP selected EPYC processors to power RISE with SAP applications hosted on Google Cloud. We expect EPYC revenue to grow by a double-digit percentage sequentially in the third quarter, led by the expanding 4th Gen EPYC CPU ramp. In addition, Siena, our first EPYC processor optimized for leadership, Edge server and telecom infrastructure is on track to launch this quarter. Turning to our broader Datacenter business, in networking, the largest cloud providers expanded their adoption of Pensando DPUs in the quarter, highlighted by new deployments with Alibaba and Oracle Cloud. In supercomputing, EPYC and Instinct processors continue to be the solutions of choice for the most powerful supercomputers in the world, powering 121 of the fastest systems on the latest top-500 list, and seven of the 10 most efficient systems on the Green500 list. In AI, we made strong progress in the second quarter as we met key hardware and software milestones to address the growing customer pull for our datacenter AI solutions. Our AI strategy is focused on three areas. First, deliver a broad portfolio and multi-generation roadmap of leadership GPUs, CPUs, and adaptive computing solutions for AI inferencing. Second, expand the open and proven software platform we have established that enables our AI hardware to be deployed broadly and easily. And third, expand the deep and collaborative partnerships we have established across the ecosystem to accelerate deployments of AMD-based AI solutions at scale. We delivered on all three fronts in the second quarter. On the software and partnership side, Hugging Face announced plans to optimize thousands of their models for AMD Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon, Versal, and Alveo platforms. To make it easier for developers to tap into the full performance and features of our AI hardware, we delivered a significant performance and feature update in our latest ROCm software and expanded support for AMD silicon across the leading frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Onyx, and technologies like OpenAI Triton. We are receiving positive feedback on the improvements and the new capabilities of our latest ROCm software stack from our AI customers and ecosystem partners. As an example, leading AI software company, MosaicML, recently highlighted that our Instinct MI250 accelerator delivers competitive training performance with minimal or no changes to the underlying AI software. On the hardware side, we announced our new Instinct MI300X GPUs designed to be the world's most advanced accelerators for generative AI. MI300X combines our next-gen CDNA 3 architecture with the industry's largest memory footprint and fastest memory bandwidth. These are critical factors in AI inferencing performance. Customer interest in our Instinct MI300A and MI300X GPUs is very high. Engagements with top-tier cloud providers, large enterprises, and numerous leading AI companies significantly expanded in the quarter. We are providing early system access and sampling both products with our lead AI, HPC, and cloud customers now, and remain on track to launch and ramp production in the fourth quarter. Turning to our Client segment, revenue declined 54% year-over-year to $1 billion. Client segment revenue increased 35% sequentially as Ryzen 7000 series CPU sales grew significantly, led by the launches of new notebooks from the largest OEMs. We also launched new commercial offerings with our first Ryzen Pro notebook and desktop processors powered by our leadership Zen 4. More than 100 AMD-powered commercial PC platforms are on track to launch this year from HP, Lenovo, and other leading OEMs as we grow this important part of our client business. We expect our Client segment will grow in the seasonally stronger second-half of the year based on the strength of our product portfolio and increased adoption of our Ryzen 7000 CPUs, including the ramp of our Ryzen 7040 mobile CPUs that deliver leadership performance and energy efficiency and are the industry's first x86 processors with a dedicated AI engine. Going forward, we see AI as a significant PC demand driver as Microsoft and other large software providers incorporate generative AI into their offerings. We are executing a multi-generational rise in AI processor roadmap which, together with our ecosystem partners, will fundamentally change the PC experience. Now, turning to our Gaming segment, revenue declined 4% year-over-year to $1.6 billion as higher semi-custom revenue was more than offset by lower gaming graphic sales. Sequentially, segment revenue declined 10%. Semi-custom SoC sales were strong in the quarter as Microsoft and Sony had healthy console demand based on improved retail availability globally and the launches of new AAA games. In gaming graphics, we expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series in the second quarter with the launch of our mainstream RX 7600 cards for 1080p gaming. We are on track to further expand our RDNA 3 GPU offerings with the launch of new enthusiast-class Radeon 7000 series cards in the third quarter. Turning to our Embedded segment, revenue increased 16% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 7% as solid demand with industrial, vision and healthcare, automotive, and broadcast customers was offset by softness with communications customers as some operators slowed their infrastructure upgrades. We expanded our leadership adaptive computing product portfolio in the quarter, launching our new Versal Premium VP1902 adaptive SoC with advanced chiplet packaging, the industry's largest and most performance solution for emulating and verifying next generation ASICs and SoCs. In the low end, we announced our Spartan UltraScale+ FPGA family to address a new range of cost-optimized, industrial, computer vision, healthcare, and robotics applications. We also released enhanced versions of our Vivado and Vitis software platforms that make it easier for customers to develop highly performant applications for our Versal Adaptive SoCs. Embedded CPU sales grew in the quarter with the launches of new AMD powered security, storage, and networking solutions from HPE, Fortinet, and other leading vendors. Looking into the second half of the year, after delivering six quarters of very strong year-over-year growth, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline in the back half of the year as lead times normalize and some customers reduce their inventory levels. We continue to be very pleased with our embedded design win momentum and in particular, the growing revenue synergy opportunities we see based on our combined adaptive and embedded processing product portfolio. In summary, we executed well in the quarter against our strategic priorities. Looking at the second half of the year, we expect the PC market to grow seasonally with more normalized inventory levels across the supply chain. In the datacenter market, we see a mixed environment as AI deployments are expanding. However, cloud customers continue optimizing their datacenter compute and enterprise customers remain cautious with new deployments. Against this backdrop, we expect strong growth driven by higher fourth-gen EPYC and Ryzen 7000 processor sales and initial shipments of our Instinct MI300 accelerators in the fourth quarter. Longer term, while we are still in the very early days of the new era of AI, it is clear that AI represents a multibillion dollar growth opportunity for AMD across cloud, edge, and an increasingly diverse number of intelligent endpoints. In the datacenter alone, we expect the market for AI accelerators to reach over $150 billion by 2027. We have increased our AI-related R&D, ecosystem enablement, and go-to-market investments to capture a significant share of this emerging market. The strong progress we are making executing our AI roadmaps and the rapid pace at which we are expanding our ecosystem of AI hardware and software partners makes us very confident we can deliver leadership, training, and inference solutions powered by our Instinct EPYC, Ryzen AI, Versal, and Alveo platforms for our customers and partners. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our second quarter results and our outlook for Q3, Jean?",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We are pleased with our second quarter results with revenue of $5.4 billion and a diluted earnings per share of $0.58. On a year-over-year basis, revenue declined 18% as growth in the Embedded segment revenue was more than offset primarily by lower Client segment revenue. Revenue was flat compared to the first quarter as growth in both the client and the Datacenter segments was offset by expected declines in the Gaming and Embedded segments. Gross margin was 50%, down approximately four percentage points from a year ago, primarily driven by lower Client segment performance, partially offset by strong Embedded segment performance. Operating expenses were $1.6 billion, an increase of 3% year-over-year primarily due to higher R&D investments. Operating income was $1.1 billion, down $114 million year-over-year and operating margin was 20%. Interest expense, taxes, and other was $120 million. For the second quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.58, compared to $1.05 in the same period last year. EPS declined on a year-over-year basis, primarily due to Client segment performance. Now, turning to our reportable segments for the second quarter, starting with the Datacenter segment, revenue was $1.3 billion, down 11% year-over-year, mainly due to lower third-generation EPYC processor sales as enterprise demand was softer and inventory levels were elevated at certain MDC customers. Datacenter revenue grew sequentially with strong sales of our fourth generation EPYC processors, specifically Gen 1 partially offset by decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Datacenter segment operating income was $147 million or 11% of revenue, compared to $472 million or 32% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to lower revenue and increased R&D investment to support future growth. Client segment revenue was $998 million down 54% year-over-year due to reduced processor shipment resulting from a weaker PC market and significant inventory correction across the PC supply chain. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 35% as we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series processors and the PC market conditions improved. Client segment operating loss was $69 million, compared to operating income of $676 million a year ago, primarily due to lower revenue. We expect the Client segment to return to profitability in the third quarter. Gaming segment revenue was $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year. Semi-customer revenue grew year-over-year, which was more than offset by lower gaming graphics revenue. On a sequential basis, gaming revenue declined 10% in line with our expectations. Gaming segment operating income was $225 million, or 14% of revenue, compared to $187 million or 11% a year ago, primarily due to higher semi-customer revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in the industrial vision, healthcare, automotive, test, and emulation markets. On a sequential basis, Embedded segment revenue declined 7%, primarily due to weaker communication market demand. Embedded segment operating income was $757 million or 52% of revenue, compared to $641 million or 51% a year ago, primarily driven by higher revenue. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow, during the quarter, we generated $379 million in cash from operations. Free cash flow was $254 million. Inventory increased by $332 million to support the continued ramp of Advanced Technology products. We expect inventory to decline as we ship this product to customers in the second half of the year. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments stood at $6.3 billion. Now, turning to our third quarter 2023 outlook, we expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion plus or minus $300 million and an increase of approximately 2.5% year-over-year and approximately 6.5% sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the Client segment to be up, Datacenter segment to be flattish, and the Gaming and Embedded segments to decline. Sequentially, we expect the Client and the Datacenter segment to each grow by a double-digit percentage and the Gaming and Embedded segments to decline. Non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.65 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. In closing, I'm pleased with our second quarter top line and bottom line execution. We expect our new product ramps across the Datacenter and Client segment to drive sequential growth into the third quarter. Importantly, our leadership product portfolio, Datacenter and AI investment priorities, and financial strengths position us well for long-term growth.",

I think we're all, across the industry, observing a shift in workload and spending patterns like maybe we've, arguably, never seen. And your company is in a great position to participate on both sides of that on the CPU strength, and obviously in the AI space. Last quarter, you had given us some metrics around potentially being able to grow your Datacenter business by 50% in the second half of the year versus the first half. And maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about that milestone and the drivers of growth across CPU and accelerator for the back half? Thanks.",

          "content": "Certainly, Matt. Thank you for your question. You're correct; the Datacenter market is very dynamic right now. Let me outline some key points. On the positive side, we are seeing an acceleration in AI demand in a few ways. We've secured several design wins in AI deployments, specifically with CPUs paired with GPUs and other accelerators. In the head nodes, we've observed positive trends on the CPU side. There\u2019s also strong interest in our MI250 accelerator, which is currently being shipped, and a significant pull for the MI300 accelerators that are set to begin production in the fourth quarter. These are the positive market dynamics we anticipate as we head into the second half of the year. However, we are noticing some softer cloud spending beyond AI as cloud vendors optimize their capital expenditures, and the enterprise sector remains somewhat weak. Nevertheless, we expect a significant ramp in our Datacenter business in the second half, particularly in the fourth quarter. We project growth in the range of approximately 50% compared to the first half. Despite the challenges, we believe customer demand is strong, making this an exciting time to be in the industry.",

There's been some conflicting reports as to whether all of those deployments are time. I think you've, in the prepared script, said what you guys think about that. I guess my question is really around the software work and the hardware itself that you're doing with your lead customers, maybe you could give a little bit about, firstly, how the customer feedback has been on the performance of the hardware itself?

We're receiving valuable feedback from leading customers and witnessing the advantages of our optimization efforts, including our collaborations with the PyTorch Foundation, Onyx, and Triton. The key takeaway is that we're gaining substantial real-time insights from these customers, allowing us to learn rapidly. Regarding performance feedback, several companies have evaluated the MI250 across a wide array of workloads, which bodes well as we transition to the MI300, and the response has been very encouraging. Customers are testing on our lab systems or their own labs, and so far, the feedback has been very positive.

So my question is, what is AMD's specific niche in this market? What is your value proposition and how sustainable is it, because you're just starting to sample the product now. So, I'm trying to get some realistic sense of how big it can be and what the specific kind of niche and differentiation is for AMD in this market?",

          "content": "Yes, sure Vivek. So, I think maybe let me take a step back and just talk about sort of our investments in AI. So, our investments in AI are very broad and I know there's a lot of interest around Datacenter, but I don't want us to lose track of the investments on the edge as well as in the client. But to your question on what is our value proposition in the Datacenter, I think what we have shown is that we have very strong capability with supercomputing, as you've mentioned. And then, as you look at AI, there are many different types of AI. If you look across training and inference, sort of the largest language models and what drives some of the performance in there when we look at MI300, MI300 is actually designed to be a highly flexible family of products that looks across all of these different segments. And in particular, where we've seen a lot of interest is in the sort of large language model inference. So, MI300X has the highest memory bandwidth, has the highest memory capacity. And if you look at that inference workload, it's actually very dependent on those things. That being said, we also believe that we have a very strong value proposition and training as well. When you look across those workloads and the investments that we're making, not just today, but going forward with our next generation MI400 series and so on and so forth, we definitely believe that we have a very competitive and capable hardware roadmap. I think the discussion about AMD, frankly, has always been about the software roadmap, and we do see a bit of a change here on the software side. Number one, we've put a tremendous amount of resource on it. So, bringing together our former Xilinx software team, together with the AMD sort of based software team, we've dramatically increased the resources. And also the focus has now been on sort of optimizing at these higher-level models. So, if you think about the frameworks around PyTorch and Triton and Onyx, I think many of the new AI centric companies are actually optimizing at a different level, and they're working very closely with us. So, in this place where AI is tremendously exciting, I think there will be multiple winners. And we will be first to say that there are multiple winners. But we think our portfolio is actually fairly unique in the sense that we do have CPUs, GPUs, we have the accelerator technology with Ryzen AI on the PC side as well as in the embedded side with our Xilinx portfolio. So, I think it's a pretty broad and capable portfolio.",

But there is also a significant component that's just the EPYC processor ramp with, as I said, the Zen 4 portfolio. In terms of the lumpiness of the revenue and where it goes into 2024. Let me give you kind of a few pieces. So, I think there was a question earlier about how much of the MI300 revenue was AI centric versus let's call it supercomputing centric. The larger piece is supercomputing, but it's meaningful revenue contribution from AI. As we go into 2024, our expectation is again, let me go back to the customer interest on MI300X is very high. There are a number of customers that are looking to deploy as quickly as possible. So, we would expect early deployments as we go into the first half of 2024, and then we would expect more volume in the second half of '24 as those things fully qualify. So, it is going to be a little bit lumpy as we get through the next few quarters. But our visibility is such that there are multiple customers that are looking to deploy as soon as possible.

So, the Datacenter and the client business are expected to grow double-digit sequentially and provide a positive impact on the gross margins, which actually more than offset the headwind from the embedded business. So, going to Q4, again we're not guiding Q4 and it's going to depend on mix. I would say one thing is you will have similar dynamics, right. Datacenters expect to grow very significantly. At the same time, we're going to have the same headwind from embedded business declining sequentially. So, overall, we do expect gross margin to improve from this level going forward.",

To your exact question of what we're seeing in the markets, we're actually seeing the core markets hold up pretty well, so let's call it aerospace and defense strong; industrial vision and healthcare strong; test and emulation strong. We are seeing communications weakness. So that is the primary driver of the second-half commentary. And there's also some inventory optimization, as you might expect, since our lead times have come down over the last several months. So, in terms of zip code, I would say think of it as double-digit down sequentially in the third quarter, and that's the current view that we have.

The key thing is, right, is if you look at a lot of our product, they are like advanced process technology, five nanometer, four nanometer, six. The manufacturing cycle tend to be long. So, in the longer term, you should expect us from days of inventory be more around 100 to 120 days versus traditionally like 80 days or 75 days.

So, co-host is one piece of it, high bandwidth memory is another piece of it, and then just the general capacity requirements.

I don't think we're ready to talk about timing yet of revenue numbers. What we will say is we do believe it's a multibillion dollar opportunity. I think 2024 is a very important year for us. Ramping MI300 in multiple customers over the next several quarters is very important. I think I mentioned earlier in the Q&A that the customer interest is actually diverse, which is great. It includes sort of what you would expect in terms of the large Tier-1 hyperscalers. But I think these new class of sort of AI focused companies have been working very closely with us, and then some of the large enterprises are also looking at ramping up their efforts. The performance that we see is strong. I think the large language model work that we've done, we've done a lot of it on MI250, and we've seen very good results on both training as well as inference. I think as we go through MI300 again, the early results are strong. For AI applications, what we're seeing now is MI300X. So, let's call it the GPU-only version is the one that is sort of most prevalent in the AI customer engagement. But the MI300A, actually, which is sort of where we have the CPU and the GPU more closely coupled together, is also of interest. So, I think the key is I think we've built a platform that does allow people to kind of choose what is best for the models and for the workloads that they're trying to enable.

And as we go into next year for the AI specific applications, we are more heavily weighted towards MI300X, just given sort of where the software is written. And to your question about gross margins at the corporate level, so we would expect that our AI business will be accretive to gross margins at the corporate level. And obviously, as you start the ramp, there's a little bit of learning, but overall we expect it to be accretive to our corporate gross margins.",

We have a number of customers who are actually committed. And the way these things go, actually it's not different, not very different than how a server ramp goes, right? I mean one starts with an initial deployment, ensures that the software works, ensures that we have all of the reliability and capability in the datacenter, and then they ramp from that. I will say the difference in AI deployments is, I think, customers are willing to go very quickly. There is sort of a desire and agility because we all want to accelerate the amount of AI compute that's out there. And so, the speed in which customers are engaged and customers are making decisions is actually faster than they would in sort of a normal, sort of regular environment. And that's great. I think that's helping us, as I said earlier, learn, perfect the software, get all of the capabilities in place for a significant ramp next year.",

Do you think that there is a theoretical limit to the share that AMD can get? Historically initially we heard 80/20 was a pervading rule, and then you busted through that. Now we are hearing customers say 70/30 is more like it. More importantly, are there anything large vendors for your server business, where you have significantly more than 30% share, let's say, 40% or even 50% share? And I have a follow-up.",

And we've been building that sort of working model, that roadmap, and the trust over the past four or five years. So, I don't think there is any theoretical cap on AMD share. I would say, if we look today, there are multiple customers who have us deployed in their datacenters more than 50% share. And from our view, the place where we have perhaps been a bit more underrepresented is in the enterprise. And that's just a matter of sort of the breadth of enterprise customers and the breadth of enterprise software. So, we believe that we have leadership today, and we are very, very focused on ensuring that we continue leadership in the market.

          "content": "Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We executed well in the third quarter, delivering strong top line and bottom line growth, achieving multiple milestones on our AI hardware and software road maps, and significantly accelerating our momentum with customers for our AI solutions. In PCs, there are now more than 50 notebook designs powered by Ryzen AI in market, and we are working closely with Microsoft on the next generation of Windows that will take advantage of our on-chip AI Engine to enable the biggest advances in the Windows user experience in more than 20 years. In the Data Center, multiple large hyperscale customers committed to deploy Instinct MI300 accelerators, supported by our latest ROCm software suite and the growing adoption of an open hardware-agnostic software ecosystem. Looking at the third quarter financial results, revenue grew 4% year-over-year and 8% sequentially to $5.8 billion, driven by record server CPU revenue and strong Ryzen processor sales. Turning to the segment results. Data Center segment revenue of $1.6 billion was flat year-over-year and up 21% sequentially as solid demand for both 3rd and 4th Gen EPYC processor families resulted in record quarterly server processor revenue. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter as 4th Gen EPYC CPU revenue grew more than 50% sequentially, crossing over to represent a majority of our server processor revenue and unit shipments. In cloud, while the demand environment remained mixed in the quarter, EPYC CPU revenue grew by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially as hyperscalers expanded deployments of EPYC processors to power their internal workloads and public instances while optimizing their infrastructure spend. Nearly 100 new AMD-powered cloud instances launched in the quarter from Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Tencent, and others, including multiple general instances that deliver leadership performance for general purpose, HPC, bare metal and memory optimized workloads. In enterprise, while overall demand remains soft, we are seeing strong indications that the significant performance and TCO advantages of Genoa and our expanded go-to-market investments are paying off as enterprise revenue grew by a double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple new wins with leading automotive, aerospace, financial services, pharmaceutical and technology customers, and the number of enterprise customers actively testing EPYC platforms on-prem increased significantly quarter-on-quarter. We also expanded our 4th Gen EPYC processor portfolio with the launch of our Ciena processors that deliver leadership energy efficiency and performance for intelligent edge and telco applications. Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro and others launched new platforms that expand our EPYC CPU TAM to address telco, retail and manufacturing applications. With the launch of Ciena, we now offer the industry's most performant and energy-efficient portfolio of server processors across cloud, enterprise, technical, HPC and edge computing. I am very pleased with the momentum we have built for our EPYC CPU portfolio. We are building on this momentum with our next-gen Turin server processors based on our new Zen 5 core that delivers significant performance and efficiency gains. Turin is in the labs of our top customers and partners now, and customer feedback has been very strong and we're on track to launch in 2024. Looking at our broader Data Center portfolio, we made significant progress in our Data Center GPU business in the third quarter as the multiyear investments we have made in our hardware and software road maps resulted in significant customer traction for our next-generation Instinct MI300 accelerators and particularly our Instinct MI300X GPU that delivers leadership inferencing and training performance. On the hardware side, bring-up and validation of our MI300A and MI300X accelerators continue progressing to plan with performance now meeting or exceeding our expectations. Production shipments of Instinct MI300A APUs started earlier this month to support the El Capitan Exascale supercomputer, and we are on track to begin production shipments of Instinct MI300X GPU accelerators to lead cloud and OEM customers in the coming weeks. On the software side, we further expanded our AI software ecosystem and made great progress enhancing the performance and features of our ROCm software in the quarter. In addition to ROCm being fully integrated into the mainline PyTorch and TensorFlow ecosystems, Hugging Face models are now regularly updated and validated to run on Instinct accelerators and other supported AMD AI hardware. AI start-up, Lemon.ai announced they achieved software parity with CUDA for LLMs running on Instinct MI250 GPUs, enabling enterprise customers to easily deploy production-ready LLMs fine-tuned for their specific data on Instinct MI250 GPUs with minimal code changes. We also strengthened our AI software capabilities with the strategic acquisitions of Mipsology and Nod.ai. Mipsology is a long-standing partner with proven expertise delivering AI software and solutions running on top of our adaptive SoCs for data center, edge and embedded markets. Nod.ai adds a highly experienced team with a track record of substantial contributions to open-source AI compilers and industry-leading software already used by many of the largest cloud enterprise and AI companies. Nod's compiler-based automation software can significantly accelerate the deployment of highly performant AI models optimized for our Instinct, Ryzen, EPYC, Versal, and Radian processors. Based on the rapid progress we are making with our AI roadmap execution and purchase commitments from cloud customers, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to be approximately $400 million in the fourth quarter and exceed $2 billion in 2024 as revenue ramps throughout the year. This growth would make MI300 the fastest product to ramp to $1 billion in sales in AMD history. I look forward to sharing more details on our progress at our December AI event. Turning to our Client segment. Revenue increased 42% year-over-year and 46% sequentially to $1.5 billion. Sales of our Ryzen 7000 processors featuring our industry-leading Ryzen AI on-chip accelerator grew significantly in the quarter as inventory levels in the PC market normalized and demand began returning to seasonal patterns. Revenue for our latest-generation client CPUs powered by our Zen 4 core more than doubled sequentially as we saw strong demand for our Ryzen 7000 Series notebook and desktop processors that deliver both leadership energy efficiency and performance across a wide range of workloads. In commercial, we launched our first Threadripper Pro workstation CPUs based on our Zen 4 Core that deliver unmatched performance for multi-threaded professional design, rendering, and simulation applications. Dell, HPE, and Lenovo announced an expanded set of workstations powered by new Threadripper Pro processors as we focus on growing this margin-accretive portion of our client business. Looking forward, we are executing on a multiyear Ryzen AI roadmap to deliver leadership compute capabilities built on top of Microsoft's Windows software ecosystem to enable the new generation of AI PCs that will fundamentally redefine the computing experience over the coming years. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially to $1.5 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Although semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections for this point in the console cycle, overall revenue for this console generation continues tracking significantly higher than the prior generation based on strong demand for Microsoft and Sony consoles. In Gaming Graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by increased demand in the channel. We expanded our Radeon 7000 series with the launch of new RX 7000 Series enthusiast desktop GPUs that offer leadership price performance for 1440p gamers. Turning to our Embedded segment. As we expected, revenue decreased 5% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. Sequentially, revenue declined 15% as lead times normalized and customers focused on reducing inventory levels. We expanded our leadership Versal SoC portfolio in the quarter with the launches of our first adaptive SoCs with on-chip HBM memory that deliver significant performance and efficiency for memory-bound data center, network, test, and aerospace applications. We also announced our next-generation space-grade Versal SoC that integrates an enhanced AI Engine and is the industry's only solution that supports unlimited reprogramming during development and after deployment. For the fintech market, we launched our latest Alveo Accelerator card that delivers a 7x improvement in latency compared to our prior generation and has already been deployed by multiple trading firms in their ultra-low latency training platforms. Since closing our acquisition of Xilinx a little over 1.5 years ago, our Embedded business has grown significantly, driven by our leadership products. Looking ahead, based on our current visibility, we expect Embedded segment revenue to decline sequentially as customers continue working through elevated inventory levels through the first half of 2024. Over the medium term, we see strong growth opportunities for our Embedded business based on our significant design win traction and our broad and differentiated portfolio of embedded FPGAs, CPUs, GPUs, and adaptive SoCs that can address a larger portion of our customers' compute needs. In summary, I'm pleased with our third quarter financial results, driven by the significant acceleration of Zen 4 server and client processor sales. Looking at the next couple of quarters, we expect strong growth in our Data Center business, driven by both EPYC and Instinct processors. This growth will be partially offset by softening demand in our Embedded business and lower semi-custom revenue, given where we are in the console cycle. As the PC market returns to seasonal patterns, we believe we are well positioned to gain profitable share in the premium and commercial portions of the market based on the strength of our product offerings. We are focused on accelerating our leadership AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, executing on our hardware and software road maps, and expanding our enterprise computing footprint. I look forward to sharing more details on our AI progress in a few weeks at our Together We Advance AI event. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide additional color on our third quarter results and our outlook for Q4.",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We delivered better than expected third-quarter results with revenue of $5.8 billion and diluted earnings per share of $0.70. On a year-over-year basis, revenue increased 4% as growth in the Client segment revenue was partially offset by lower Gaming and Embedded segment revenue. Revenue was up 8% sequentially, driven by growth in both the Client and the Data Center segment. Gross margin was 51%, up approximately 1 percentage point year-over-year primarily driven by stronger Client segment revenue and product mix. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher R&D investment to support our significant AI growth opportunity. Operating income was $1.3 billion, representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other were $141 million. For the third quarter, diluted earnings per share was $0.70 compared to $0.67 in the same period last year. Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $1.6 billion, flat year-over-year as growth in the EPYC processor sales was offset by a decline in adaptive SoC product sales. Data Center revenue grew 21% sequentially, primarily driven by strong sales of our 4th Gen EPYC processors to both cloud and enterprise customers. Data Center segment operating income was $306 million or 19% of revenue compared to $505 million or 31% a year ago. Lower operating income was primarily due to increased R&D investment to support future AI revenue growth and product mix. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 42% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher sales of Ryzen mobile processors. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 46% as PC market conditions continued to improve, and we ramped our Ryzen 7000 series to meet strong demand. Client segment operating income was $140 million or 10% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $26 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue and disciplined OpEx management. We are pleased that the Client segment returned to profitability in the third quarter. Gaming segment revenue was $1.5 billion, down 8% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by increases in Radeon GPU sales. On a sequential basis, Gaming segment revenue declined 5%, in line with our expectations as we are now in the fourth year of the console cycle. Gaming segment operating income was $208 million or 14% of revenue compared to $142 million or 9% a year ago, primarily driven by higher Radeon GPU revenue. Embedded segment revenue was $1.2 billion, down 5% year-over-year, primarily due to lower sales to the communication market. On a sequential basis, Embedded segment revenue declined 15%, primarily due to inventory correction at customers in several end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $612 million or 49% of revenue compared to $635 million or 49% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $421 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $297 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect to pay approximately $550 million in cash taxes, primarily due to previously deferred taxes from California disaster relief efforts made available by the IRS. Inventory decreased sequentially by $122 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were strong at $5.8 billion. We returned $511 million to shareholders, repurchasing 4.8 million shares and we have $5.8 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization. Now turning to our fourth quarter 2023 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.1 billion, plus or minus $300 million, an increase of approximately 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Year-over-year, we expect revenue for the Data Center and the Client segments to be up by a strong double-digit percentage, the Gaming segment to decline, given where we are in the console cycle, and the Embedded segment to decline due to additional softening of demand in the embedded market. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment to grow by a strong double-digit percentage, Client segment revenue to increase and the Gaming and Embedded segment to decline by double-digit percentage. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 51.5%, non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.74 billion, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. In closing, I\u2019m pleased with our execution in the third quarter with year-over-year growth in revenue, gross margin and earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, we expect to benefit from strong Data Center and Client momentum, driven by MI300 AI accelerated ramp and the strength of our high-performance leadership Zen 4 family of products despite lower sales in the Gaming segment and additional softening of demand in the embedded market. Looking ahead, the investment we are making in AI across our Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded segments enable us to offer one of the best industry\u2019s broadest portfolio, targeting the most compelling opportunities and positioning us to drive long-term profitable growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mitch for the Q&A session.",

In the first quarter, we expect revenue to remain in that $400 million range, mostly driven by AI, with a small portion from HPC. Throughout 2024, we forecast continuing quarterly revenue growth, predominantly from AI. Our engagement with customers spans hyperscalers, OEMs, enterprise clients, and new AI start-ups. We expect MI300 to be utilized for both training and inference workloads, and are particularly satisfied with its performance in inference, especially for large language models, thanks to its memory bandwidth and capacity.

Is the growth that you're seeing or the growth that you saw in Q3 and the growth that you're guiding to for Q4, is this primarily a function of share growth or are you actually seeing a pickup in the overall market? And I ask the question because, obviously, year-to-date, there's been a significant shift away from traditional compute to accelerated computing, but are you actually starting to see signs of stabilization or even improvement on the traditional compute side?

And when I look underneath that, I would say with a strong growth in both cloud. Cloud was strong, so strong double-digits. The adoption is pretty broad across first-party and third-party workloads and new instances. And then on the enterprise side, we've also seen some nice growth across our OEMs. And so from the standpoint of whether it's the market recovery or share gain? I think it's some of both. From a market standpoint, I would say it\u2019s still mixed. I think enterprise is still a little bit mixed depending on sort of which region from a macroeconomic standpoint. Cloud depends a bit on the customer set. But overall, I think we\u2019re pleased with the progress and the leadership of EPYC has ended up, allowing us to grow substantially in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter.",

Due to the long manufacturing lead times, we believe the revenue from Data Center GPUs will stay at a similar level. Generally speaking, our business does experience seasonality, with the Client, Server, and Gaming businesses typically seeing declines in Q1. Currently, we are facing additional seasonality due to the dynamics in Embedded and Gaming. Server and Client sectors also typically experience seasonal declines. Overall, our main focus is on executing our plans. We will likely have more detailed information as we approach Q1 2024.

Moving forward, we have seen a return to growth in the server CPU market, particularly with products like the 4th Gen EPYC, which offers between 96 and 128 cores, providing substantial computing power. While unit growth may be somewhat modest, the increase in average selling price due to core count and computing capability will contribute to overall growth.

On the other market where we see a little bit of, let's call it, soft end market demand would be industrial, and that's a little bit more geographic, so a little bit worse in Europe than in other geographies. The other end markets are actually relatively good. And what we just see is that inventory is high, just given where we were with lead times coming into the sort of through the pandemic and with the high demand that was out there. As the lead times have normalized, people are drawing down their inventories and they have an opportunity to do that, given the normalization. So from an overall standpoint, we think demand is solid. And what we view is that we have a very strong portfolio in Embedded. We like sort of the combination of the, let's call it, the classic Xilinx portfolio together with the Embedded processing capabilities that we add. Customers have seen sort of that portfolio come together, and we've gotten some nice design win traction as a result of that.

Our Pensando acquisition has actually been really helpful in this area. I think we have a world-class team of experts in this area, and we're also partnered with some of the networking ecosystem overall. So going forward, I don't think we're going to sell full systems, let's call it, AMD-branded systems. We believe that there are others who are more set up for that.

I wouldn't have thought gross margin would have hung in as well and grown sequentially each quarter through the year. Obviously, Client margins got better.

We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion sequentially, 140 basis points. As you mentioned, the Embedded segment, revenue actually declined double-digits sequentially. There are two primary drivers. The first one is definitely Data Center grew 21% sequentially, which should provide a tailwind to our gross margin. Secondly, as we go through the inventory correction in the PC market, we did encounter some headwinds in the Client segment gross margin. And in Q3, we saw very significant improvement with our client segment gross margin. I think going forward, the pace of Client segment improvement will moderate, but it will continue to drive incremental gross margin improvement in Client segment. So that really is why we are able to drive sequential growth in Q3. And in Q4, I would say the major dynamics is with a very strong double-digit growth in Data Center business, we definitely have the tailwind, which more than offset the Embedded segment decline sequentially double-digit again. I think going forward, it's really mix, primarily mix is driving our gross margin, but we feel pretty good about the second half next year when we can expand the Data Center significantly and especially, Embedded segment start to recover, we should be able to drive more meaningful gross margin improvement in second half.",

More memory means you can use fewer GPUs for inference, which is beneficial in terms of total ownership costs. On the software side, we've had to invest significantly and enhance our efforts. Our customers and partners are increasingly transitioning to hardware-agnostic solutions, which helps optimize at the higher-level frameworks and lowers the barriers to adopting new solutions.

When we think about sort of the EPYC portfolio and what we've been able to build over the last few generations and what we have going forward with Zen 5 and beyond, process technology is only one piece of the optimization. It's really about process technology, packaging. We're leading sort of the usage of chiplets and 2.5D and 3D integration and then when you go to architecture and design. So it's really the holistic product. And from a pricing standpoint, actually, price is only one aspect of the conversation. Much of the conversation is on how much performance can you give me at what efficiency. So from an overall efficiency standpoint, I think we've developed fantastic products. We are working closely with our customers to ensure that we continue to evolve our overall portfolio. So I think from a value-added standpoint, it's providing the best TCO is what our customers are looking for, and that's where our roadmap is headed. Going forward, I think having the CPU, the GPU, the FPGAs, and the DPUs, I think it gives us actually a nice portfolio to really optimize not just on a single component basis, but on sort of all of the different workloads that you need in the data center.",

If Data Center is expected to grow by 50% compared to the previous half and I assume Client will see a sequential increase, that suggests Gaming and Embedded are likely to decline sequentially by around 20%. I understand you mentioned double-digit declines. Is that accurate? If it is, particularly for Embedded, what implications does this have for next year? You've indicated a weak outlook for the first half. Does this mean it will remain stable at current levels or will it continue to drop in the first half until it stabilizes? How should we interpret this in light of the guidance you provided for Q4?",

Regarding Embedded and Gaming, we expect Embedded to remain at levels similar to Q3, which saw a decline in the teens, and we anticipate Q4 will follow the same trend. For Gaming, particularly in consoles, we expect a more significant decline. As we move into Q1, while being cautious about specifics, we expect both gaming and embedded to continue to decline, with other comments relating more to seasonal patterns.

So I know that they've been extending through the year, but for the full year, they're actually down. And I get the mix things and everything else. But as I look into next year, like how do I think about this because it sounds like Embedded is going to be pretty weak next year. Client is what it is. Data Center is growing but it does feel like even if the GPUs are accretive, they're not accretive yet, and it's going to take them a while to get to be accretive.

It's one of the worst down cycles during the last 3 decades. So during that kind of a down cycle, definitely, we had headwinds on gross margin side, on our Client business, which we have made significant progress in Q3 and Q4 in second half. Going into next year, the mix primarily is the driver of our gross margin. The way to think about it is Data Center is going to be the largest incremental revenue contributor next year. And then with both Gaming and Embedded facing continued sequential decline, I think it's all about the mix. We do expect next year will improve gross margin versus 2023, especially second half.

What I'm most excited about in PCs is actually the AI PC. I think the AI PC opportunity is an opportunity to redefine what PCs are in terms of productivity tool and really sort of operating on sort of user data. And so I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward. And I think that's where the conversation is going to be about. It's going to be less about what instructions that you're using and more about what experience are you delivering to customers.

          "content": "Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening in today. We finished 2023 strong as Data Center sales accelerated significantly throughout the year, despite the mixed demand environment. As a result, we delivered record Data Center segment annual revenue and strong top-line and bottom-line growth in the fourth quarter, driven by the ramp of Instinct AI accelerators and robust demand for EPYC server CPUs across cloud, enterprise and AI customers. Looking at our financial results, fourth quarter revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $6.2 billion, driven by a significant double-digit percentage growth in our Data Center and Client segments. On a full-year basis, annual revenue declined 4% to $22.7 billion as record Data Center and Embedded segment annual revenue was offset by lower Client and Gaming segment revenue. Importantly, Data Center and Embedded segment annual revenue grew by $1.2 billion and accounted for more than 50% of revenue in 2023 as we gained server share, launched our next-generation Instinct AI accelerators and maintained our position as the industry's largest provider of adaptive computing solutions. Turning to the fourth quarter business results, Data Center segment revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. Server CPU and Data Center GPU sales both set quarterly and annual revenue records as sales of our Data Center products accelerated throughout the year. We gained server CPU revenue share in the quarter, driven by significant double-digit percentage growth in 4th Gen EPYC Processor revenue and demand for our 3rd Gen EPYC Processor portfolio. In Cloud, while the overall demand environment remained soft, server CPU revenue increased year-over-year and sequentially as North American hyperscalers expanded 4th Gen EPYC Processor deployments to power their internal workloads and public instances. Amazon, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft and Oracle brought more than 55 AMD-powered AI, HPC and general-purpose cloud instances into preview or general availability in the fourth quarter. Exiting 2023, there were more than 800 EPYC CPU based public cloud instances available. We expect this number to grow in 2024 based on the leadership performance, efficiency and features of our EPYC CPU portfolio. In Enterprise, sales accelerated by a significant double-digit percentage in the quarter as we built momentum with Forbes 2000 customers. We closed multiple wins with large financial, energy, automotive, retail, technology and pharmaceutical companies, positioning us well for continued growth, based on expanded production deployments planned for 2024. A growing number of customers are adopting EPYC CPUs for inferencing workloads, where our leadership throughput performance delivers significant advantages on smaller models like Llama 7B, as well as the power head nodes in large training and inference clusters. Looking ahead, customer excitement for our upcoming Turin family of EPYC Processors is very strong. Turin is a drop-in replacement for existing 4th Gen EPYC platforms that extends our performance, efficiency and TCO leadership with the addition of our next-gen Zen 5 core, new memory expansion capabilities and higher core counts. Internal and end customer validation work is progressing to plan with Turin on track to deliver overall performance leadership, as well as leadership on a per core or per watt basis across a wide range of workloads when it launches later this year. Turning to our Broader Data Center portfolio, our Data Center GPU business accelerated significantly in the quarter, with revenue exceeding our $400 million expectations, driven by a faster ramp for MI300X with AI customers. We launched our MI300 accelerator family in December with strong partner and ecosystem support from multiple large cloud providers, all the major OEMs and many leading AI developers. MI300X GPUs deliver leadership generated AI performance by combining our high-performance CDNA 3 architecture with industry-leading memory bandwidth and capacity. Customer response to MI300 has been overwhelmingly positive. And we are aggressively ramping production to support the dozens of cloud, enterprise and supercomputing customers deploying Instinct accelerators. In Cloud, we are working closely with Microsoft, Oracle, Meta and other large cloud customers on Instinct GPU deployments, powering both their internal AI workloads and external offerings. For Enterprise customers, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro and other server vendors are on track to launch differentiated MI300 platforms later this quarter with strong demand from multiple enterprise customers. In HPC Supercomputing, we shipped the majority of AMD Instinct MI300A accelerators for the El Capitan supercomputer in the fourth quarter and expect to complete shipments this quarter for what is expected to be the world's fastest supercomputer when it comes online later this year. We also closed new Instinct GPU wins in the quarter, including the flagship system at the German High Performance Computing Center, HLRS, as well as what is expected to be one of the world's most powerful enterprise supercomputers for energy company Eni. On AI software development, we made significant progress expanding the ecosystem of AI developers working on AMD platforms with the release of our ROCm 6 software suite. The ROCm 6 stack significantly increases performance in key generative AI workloads, adds expanded support and optimizations for additional frameworks and libraries and simplifies the overall developer experience. The additional functionality and optimizations of ROCm 6 and the growing volume of contributions from the Open Source AI Software community are enabling multiple large hyperscale and enterprise customers to rapidly bring up their most advanced large language models on AMD Instinct accelerators. For example, we are very pleased to see how quickly Microsoft was able to bring up GPT-4 on MI300X in their production environment and rollout Azure private previews of new MI300 instances aligned with the MI300X launch. At the same time, our partnership with Hugging Face, the leading open platform for the AI community, now enables hundreds of thousands of AI models to run out of the box on AMD GPUs and we are extending that collaboration to our other platforms. Looking ahead, our prior guidance was for Data Center GPU revenue to be flattish from Q4 to Q1 and exceed $2 billion for 2024. Based on the strong customer pool and expanded engagements, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to grow sequentially in the first quarter and exceed $3.5 billion in 2024. We have also made significant progress with our supply chain partners and have secured additional capacity to support upside demand. Turning to our Client segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 62% year-over-year and flat sequentially. We launched our latest generation Ryzen 8000 series notebooks and desktop processors in January, including our Ryzen 8040 Mobile series that combined leadership compute performance and energy efficiency with an updated MPU that delivers up to 60% more AI performance compared to our prior generation that was already industry-leading. Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, MSI and other large PC OEMs will all offer notebooks powered by our Ryzen 8000 series processors, with the first systems expected to go on sale in February. To further our leadership in AI PCs, we launched our Ryzen 8000 G-series processors earlier this month, which are the industry's first desktop CPUs with an integrated AI engine. Millions of AI PCs powered by Ryzen processors have shipped to date and Ryzen CPUs power more than 90% of AI-enabled PCs currently in market. Our work with Microsoft and our PC ecosystem partners to enable the next-generation of AI PCs expanded significantly in the quarter. We are aggressively driving our Ryzen AI CPU roadmap to extend our AI leadership, including our next-gen Strix processors that are expected to deliver more than three times the AI performance of our Ryzen 7040 series processors. Strix combines our next-gen Zen 5 core with enhanced RDNA graphics and an updated Ryzen AI engine to significantly increase the performance, energy efficiency and AI capabilities of PCs. Customer momentum for Strix is strong with the first notebooks on track to launch later this year. Looking at 2024, we are planning for the PC TAM to grow modestly year-on-year, weighted towards the second half as AI PCs ramp. We continue to see strong growth opportunities for our client business as we ramp our current products, extend our AIPC leadership and launch our next wave of Zen 5 CPUs. Now turning to our Gaming segment, revenue declined 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially to $1.4 billion as lower semi-custom revenue was partially offset by increased sales of Radeon GPUs. Semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections in the quarter. Going forward, we now expect annual revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage year-over-year as supply caught up with demand in 2023, and we entered the fifth year of what has been a very strong console cycle. In Gaming Graphics, revenue grew both year-over-year and sequentially, driven by strong demand in the channel for both our Radeon 6000 and Radeon 7000 series GPUs. We expanded our Radeon 7000 GPU series with the launch of new RX 7600 XT Series enthusiast desktop GPUs earlier this month that offer leadership price performance for 1080p gaming. We also launched new open-source FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 software that can deliver significantly higher gaming frame rates on both GPUs and APUs. Turning to our Embedded segment, revenue decreased 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially to $1.1 billion as customers focused on reducing their inventory levels. We expanded our embedded portfolio in the quarter with new leadership solutions for key markets. We launched new Versal Prime adaptive SoCs for the aerospace, test and measurement, healthcare and communications markets that deliver industry-first support for DDR5 memory and increased DSP capability compared to our prior generation. In automotive, we launched new Versal SoC solutions that bring industry-leading AI compute capabilities and advanced safety and security features to next-generation vehicles. We also launched Ryzen embedded processors with unmatched performance and features for industrial automation, machine vision, robotics and edge server applications. Looking at 2024, we expect overall embedded demand will remain soft through the first half of the year as customers continue to focus on normalizing their inventory levels. Longer term, we are very confident in the growth trajectory of our Embedded business as our expanded product portfolio drove more than $10 billion of design wins in 2023, an increase of more than 25% compared to 2022. In summary, I'm very pleased with our fourth quarter and full-year results. For 2024, we expect the demand environment to remain mixed, with strong growth in our Data Center and Client segments, offset by declines in our Embedded and Gaming segments. Against this backdrop, we believe we will deliver strong annual revenue growth and expand gross margin, driven by the strength of our Instinct EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios. Taking a step back, we believe AI is a once-in-a-generation transition that will reshape virtually every portion of the computing market, starting in the Data Center and then expanding into PCs and across multiple embedded markets. We have built excellent customer traction based on the strength of our multi-year AI hardware and software road maps, and we see clear opportunities to drive our next wave of growth as we deliver leadership AI solutions across our portfolio. In the Data Center, we see 2024 as a start of a multi-year AI adoption cycle with the market for Data Center AI accelerators growing to approximately $400 billion in 2027. Customer deployments of our Instinct GPUs continues accelerating, with MI300 now tracking to be the fastest revenue ramp of any product in our history, and positioning us well to capture significant share over the coming years based on the strength of our multi-generation Instinct GPU road map and open-source ROCm software strategy. In PCs, we are focused on delivering our long-term road maps with leadership Ryzen AI NPU capabilities to enable differentiated experiences as Microsoft and our other software partners bring new AI capabilities to PC starting later this year. At the same time, we are rapidly driving leadership AI compute capabilities across the full breadth of our embedded product portfolio. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry and an even more exciting time for AMD as our leadership IP, broad product portfolio and deep customer relationships position us well to deliver significant revenue growth and earnings expansion over the next several years. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full-year financial results.",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. AMD executed well in 2023 despite a mixed market demand environment, delivering revenue of $22.7 billion and earnings per share of $2.65. We drove year-over-year revenue growth in our Embedded and Data Center segments. In addition, we successfully launched our AMD Instinct MI300 GPUs, positioning us for a strong ramp in 2024 in the AI market. For the fourth quarter of 2023, revenue was $6.2 billion, growing 10% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segments was partially offset by the lower revenue in our Embedded and Gaming segment. Revenue was up 6% sequentially, primarily driven by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs across several leading customers and higher revenue from EPYC server processors, partially offset by the decline in Embedded and Gaming segment revenues. Gross margin was 51%, flat year-over-year, with higher revenue contribution from the Data Center and the Client segments offset by lower Embedded segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year as we invest in R&D and marketing activities to support our significant AI growth opportunities. Operating income was $1.4 billion, representing a 23% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $163 million. For the fourth quarter of 2023, diluted earnings per share was $0.77, an increase of 12% year-over-year. Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center segment, revenue was $2.3 billion, up 38% year-over-year and 43% sequentially driven by strong growth of both AMD Instinct GPU and the Fourth Generation AMD EPYC CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $666 million or 29% of revenue compared to $444 million or 27% a year ago. Higher operating income was primarily due to operating liability driven by higher revenue. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 62% year-over-year, driven by Ryzen 7000 Series CPU sales. Client segment operating income was $55 million or 4% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $152 million a year ago driven by higher revenue. Gaming segment revenue was $1.4 billion, down 17% year-over-year and 9% sequentially due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue, partially offset by an increase in Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $224 million or 16% of revenue compared to $266 million or 16% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $1.1 billion, down 24% year-over-year and 15% sequentially as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Embedded segment operating income was $461 million or 44% of revenue compared to $699 million or 50% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $381 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $242 million. Inventory decreased sequentially by $94 million to $4.4 billion. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investment was strong at $5.8 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares and returned $233 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased 10 million shares and returned $985 million to shareholders. We have $5.6 billion in remaining share repurchase authorization. Now turning to our first quarter of 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.4 billion plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment revenue to be flat, with the seasonal decline in server sales offset by strong Data Center GPU ramp. Embedded revenue to decline as customers continue to work down their inventory levels. Client segment revenue to decline seasonally. And in the Gaming segment as we enter the fifth year of what has been a very strong gaming cycle and given current customer inventory levels, we expect revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. Year-over-year, we expect Data Center and Client segment revenues to increase by strong double-digit percentage given the strength of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities. Embedded Segment to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. In addition, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 52%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.73 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.63 billion shares. While we are not providing specific full-year guidance for 2024, let me provide some color. Directionally, for the year, we expect 2024 Data Center and Client segment revenue to increase driven by the strengths of our product portfolio and the share gain opportunities. Embedded segment revenue to decline and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by significant double-digit percentage. We expect to expand gross margin in 2024 and continue to invest to address the large AI opportunities while driving operating model leverage to deliver earnings per share growth faster than top-line revenue growth. In closing, we delivered solid financial results in 2023. We further strengthened our product portfolio and established ourselves as a leading provider of Data Center GPUs for AI. We are very well positioned to build on this momentum and deliver strong financial performance in 2024 and beyond.",

It was expected to be back-end quarter heavy as we ramped the product, and the MI300A, our HPC product, performed well. Additionally, the MI300X, our AI product, exceeded our expectations due to strong customer demand, smooth qualification processes, and effective manufacturing ramp-up. We surpassed $400 million in revenue for that business in the fourth quarter. As we move into the first quarter, we anticipate server seasonality in the range of high-single-digit to low-double-digit growth. There are also other components of the Data Center business to consider. Importantly, we initially expected a slower ramp for our MI300X, but the supply chain is functioning well, and customer demand remains strong. Therefore, we expect MI300X to see increased growth as we progress into the first quarter, and everything is going quite positively.",

That's Embedded. On the Gaming side, Lisa mentioned during her prepared remarks is we have the latest stage of product cycle in the fifth year of gaming console.

So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on, as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious. That being the case though, we also see opportunities for us to continue to grow share in the traditional server business. I think our portfolio is extremely strong. The adoption of Genoa and Bergamo, as well as our new Siena product lines are getting a lot of traction. And then, we also see Turin, our Zen 5 product coming in the second half of the year.

I think the ramp that we've seen, the customer traction that we've seen even in the last few months, I think has been great. And that gives us a lot of confidence in the ramp of this business. I think the beauty of the AI market here is it's growing so quickly that I think we have both the market dynamic as well as our ability to gain share in that framework. The point I will make is our customer engagements right now are all quite strategic, dozens of customers with multi-generational conversations. So, as excited as we are about the ramp of MI300 and, frankly, there's a lot to do in 2024. We are also very excited about the opportunities to extend that into the next couple of years out into that '25, '26, '27 timeframe. So, I think we see a lot of growth.

And then I guess within Data Center, if you just add the incremental Data Center GPU revenue and you assume that the server business grows a little bit, it seems like that should maybe double year-over-year, but I'm kind of wondering if you can give us any ranges on those numbers?

Of course, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center between both the server side gaining more share, and Data Center GPU side with the significant ramp up of our MI300. I think that's how we think about it. We do have a headwind from Gaming segment. We do think year-over-year, we'll see very significant double-digit decline on the Gaming segment. And at the same time Embedded is going through the bottoming process. We do think the second half we will see the recovery. So those are the puts and takes. I can talk about it.",

I'm interested in hearing more about the roadmap for your MI accelerator family. Will it continue to include parts that combine CPU and GPU, or will it primarily focus on GPU? What kind of timeline are you envisioning? Any insights you can share about the future trajectory of that program would be really helpful. Thanks.",

I think what's benefited us here is our use of chiplet technologies, which has given us the ability to have sort of both the APU version and the GPU version, and we continue to use that to differentiate ourselves and that's how we get our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages. As we go forward, you can imagine, like we did in the EPYC timeframe, we planned multiple generations in sequence. That's the way we're planning the roadmap. One of the things I will note about the AI accelerator market is the demand for compute is so high that we are seeing sort of an acceleration of the roadmap generations here, and we are similarly planning acceleration of our roadmap. I would say that we'll talk more about the overall roadmap beyond MI300 as we get into later this year. But you can be assured that we're working very closely with our customers to have a very competitive roadmap for both training and inference that will come out over the next couple of years.",

But I think what we need to look at is growth rate and how do we get to those growth rates. I think we expect units to grow sort of substantial double-digit percentage. But you should also expect that content is going to grow. So, if you think about how important memory and memory capacity is as we go forward, you can imagine that we'll see acceleration there and just the overall content as we go to more advanced technology nodes. So, there's some ASP uplift in there. And then, what we also do is we are planning longer-term roadmaps with our customers in terms of how they're thinking about sort of the size of training clusters, the number of training clusters. And then, the fact that we believe inference is actually going to exceed training as we go into the next couple of years just given that more enterprises adopt. So, I think as we look at all those pieces, I think we feel good that the growth rate is going to be significant and sustained over the next few years. In terms of what's in that TAM, it really is accelerator TAM. So, within accelerators, there are certainly GPUs and there will also be some ASICs that are other accelerators that are in that TAM. As we think about sort of the different types of models from smaller models to fine-tuning of models, to the largest large language models, I think you're going to need different silicon for those different use cases. But from our standpoint, GPUs are still going to be the sort of the compute element of choice when you're talking about training and inferencing on the largest language models.",

We always said that the best way of optimizing the software is working directly on the most important workloads. And we've seen performance come up nicely, which is what we expect frankly with the GPU capabilities that we would have to do some level of optimization, but the optimization has gone well. I think to your broader question. The way I look at this is, there are lots of opportunities for us to work directly with large customers, both on the Cloud side as well as on the Enterprise side, who have specific training and inferencing workloads. Our job is to make it as easy as possible for them and so our entire tool chain, all of our sort of the overall ROCm suite has really gone through significant progress over the last six to nine months. And then, we're also getting some nice support from the open-source community. So, the work that Hugging Face is doing is tremendous.

How should we think about that? And I guess more importantly, some of the cloud potential customers that have yet to officially sign-up for or sign-off on the MI300.

So, yes, it should increase each quarter, but be a bit more second half weighted. And then, to your comment about customers, look, we are engaged with all of sort of the large customers. These are all folks that know what's really well, given our deep relationships in EPYC. I think people just have different adoption cycles as they consider what they're trying to do in their roadmap. But I view this as still very, very early innings for us in this space. And I think the question was asked earlier. I think the key is this is not just about the MI300 conversation. But it really is about sort of our long-term multi-generational roadmap. And so, that's the context on which we're working with our largest customers, as well as, as you know, there's a lot of demand coming from folks that are more AI centric and not necessarily typical cloud customers, but more enterprise or let's call it AI-specific companies that we're also very well engaged with.",

I'm pretty sure you're working through some kinks as it pertains to the Instinct ramp. Hopefully, that improves over time. So that should be a tailwind. FPGAs perhaps the second half turns for the better. And you've got server CPU volume growth throughout the year.

We guided the Q1, 120 basis points higher than Q4 sequentially, primarily because the higher Data Center contribution actually more than offset the decline of Embedded business in Q1. Going forward, the way to think about it is as you said is the major driver is going to be Data Center business is going to grow much faster than other segments. That mix change will help us to expand the gross margin nicely. I think you also are spot on, the Embedded coming back in second half, which will be a tailwind. With the Data Center GPU, we are at the very early stage of ramp. We are improving testing time yield and continue to expand gross margin and we expect to be accretive to corporate average. So, those are all the tailwinds coming in the second half. I would say the headwinds side continue to be in the first half where we see Embedded business not only Q1 we see sequential decline, Q2 probably are going to be sequentially flattish versus Q1. That is a headwind for us. Because it does have a very nice gross margin. But overall, we feel pretty good about the trajectory of the gross margin improvement, especially second half.",

But as we look at the inferencing environment, we think we have significant advantages. And that's showing through in some of our customer work. So we think for both training and inference, we will continue to be very competitive. And then, as you go into the CPU side again, from our view, with each generation of EPYC, we've continued to gain share. I think we exited the fourth quarter at record share for AMD. And we're still quite underrepresented in Enterprise. So I think there is an opportunity for us to continue to gain share as we go through 2024. From a competitive standpoint, what we see is Zen 4 is extremely competitive right now with Genoa, Bergamo, Siena.

And I'm curious what drove the change, was it incremental demand signals, was it supply? And can you supply more of, let's say, demand is $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion, right, what is the limitation? And sort of related to that, on the competition side, your competitor will launch their B100 later in the year, do you think that will change the competitive landscape in any way?",

With orders coming in and programs transitioning from pilot phases to full manufacturing, we've revised our revenue forecast accordingly. From a supply perspective, we are preparing for success and collaborating closely with our supply chain partners to ensure we can deliver more than $3.5 billion, potentially much more based on customer demand in the latter half of the year. Regarding our roadmap, we remain committed to developing a competitive strategy that looks beyond MI300.

If I look at the success that AMD has enjoyed, its many factors, but a few of them included your early adoption of chiplets and the strong partnerships you have had with TSMC. But now we are seeing your x86 competitor Intel also adopt chiplet or tile technology as they call it. And then I think recently the manufacturing update they gave, they said they are two years ahead in terms of incorporating gate all-around and backside our delivery. So, let's assume they are right and they have either caught up to TSMC or maybe they are ahead. What impact does that have on AMD in kind of the medium to longer-term?",

I think we've learned a lot about how to optimize performance there. We are very aggressive with our adoption of leading-edge technology as it's needed. But I think those are only a few of the pieces. We're also focused on continuing to innovate on architecture and design. So, I think the longer-term question that you ask is I think we're expecting that the competition is going to be on a similar process technology and even in that case, I think we feel like we have a very strong roadmap going forward and will continue to drive both the CPU and the GPU roadmap very aggressively.",

The question we get a lot from our customers is they want to understand the value proposition of the MI300. So, Lisa, I was hoping you could give us some understanding of price versus power comparison or compute power? And then today, are you seeing your customers that are buying the MI300 are they primarily buying it for inferencing today or are they using it primarily for tooling? And maybe for Jean. Jean, do you think is it possible for MI300 to finish the year at a run-rate of about $1.5 billion?",

Again, customers are using it for different reasons, but presume that there is a performance per dollar benefit to using AMD. So that's one piece of it. The other piece of it though is we intrinsically have more bandwidth and memory capacity on MI300X compared to the competition. And what that means is for large language models that are many tens of billions of parameters, you could do the workload in fewer GPUs. So, it's a substantial system savings and allows you to do much more work within the same system. In terms of what customers are using MI300 for today, I would say there are a number of customers using it for large language model inferencing and there are also customers that are using it for training. So I think the whole point is being a strong partner. When you put these AI systems in place, they are sometimes mixed-use systems. So they would be used for both training and inference.",

          "content": "Thanks, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. This is an incredibly exciting time for the industry as the widespread deployment of AI is driving demand for significantly more compute across a broad range of markets. Under this backdrop, we are executing very well as we ramp our data center business and enable AI capabilities across our product portfolio. Looking at the first quarter, revenue increased to $5.5 billion. We expanded gross margin by more than 2 percentage points and increased profitability as Data Center and Client segment sales each grew by more than 80% year-over-year. Data Center segment revenue grew 80% year-over-year and 2% sequentially to a record $2.3 billion. The substantial year-over-year growth was driven by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct MI300X GPU shipments and a double-digit percentage increase in server CPU sales. We believe we gained server CPU revenue share in the seasonally down first quarter, led by growth in enterprise adoption and expanded cloud deployments. In cloud, while the overall demand environment remains mixed, hyperscalers continued adopting fourth-gen EPYC processors to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. There are now nearly 900 AMD-powered public instances available globally as Amazon, Microsoft and Google all increased their fourth-gen EPYC processor offerings with new instances and regional deployments. In the enterprise, we have seen signs of improving demand as CIOs need to add more general-purpose and AI compute capacity while maintaining the physical footprint and power needs of their current infrastructure. This scenario aligns perfectly with the value proposition of our EPYC processors. Given our high core count and energy efficiency, we can deliver the same amount of compute with 45% fewer servers compared to the competition, cutting initial CapEx by up to half and lowering annual OpEx by more than 40%. As a result, enterprise adoption of EPYC CPUs is accelerating, highlighted by deployments with large enterprises, including American Airlines, DBS, Emirates Bank, Shell and STMicro. We're also building momentum with AMD-powered solutions powering the most popular ERP and database applications. As one example of the latest generation of Oracle Exadata, the leading database solution used by 76 of the Fortune 100, is now powered exclusively by fourth-gen EPYC processors. Looking ahead, we're very excited about our next-gen Turin family of EPYC processors featuring our Zen 5 core. We're widely sampling Turin and the silicon is looking great. In the cloud, the significant performance and efficiency increases of Turin position us well to capture an even larger share of both first and third-party workloads. In addition, there are 30% more Turin platforms in development from our server partners compared to fourth-gen EPYC platforms, increasing our enterprise SAM with new solutions optimized for additional workloads. Turin remains on track to launch later this year. Turning to our broader Data Center portfolio, we delivered our second straight quarter of record data center GPU revenue as MI300 became the fastest-ramping product in AMD history, passing $1 billion in total sales in less than two quarters. In cloud, MI300X production deployments expanded at Microsoft, Meta and Oracle to power Generative AI training and inferencing for both internal workloads and a broad set of public offerings. For the enterprise, we're working very closely with Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro and others as multiple MI300X platforms enter volume production this quarter. In addition, we have more than 100 enterprise and AI customers actively developing or OpenAI for MI300X. On the AI software front, we made excellent progress adding upstream support for AMD hardware in the OpenAI Triton compiler, making it even easier to develop highly performant AI software for AMD platforms. We also released a major update to our ROCm software stack that expanded support for open source libraries, including vLLM, and frameworks, including JAKs, adds new features like video decode and significantly increases generative AI performance by integrating advanced attention algorithm support for sparsity and FPA. Our partners are seeing very strong performance in their AI workloads. As we jointly optimize for their models, MI300X GPUs are delivering leadership inferencing performance and substantial TCO advantages compared to H100. For instance, several of our partners are seeing significant increases in tokens per second when running their flagship LLMs on MI300X compared to H100. We're also continuing to enable the broad ecosystem required to power the next generation of AI systems, including as a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium, working to optimize the widely adopted Ethernet protocol to run AI workloads at data center scale. MI300 demand continues to strengthen. And based on our expanding customer engagements, we now expect data center GPU revenue to exceed $4 billion in 2024, up from the $3.5 billion we guided in January. Longer term, we are increasingly working closer with our cloud and enterprise customers as we expand and accelerate our AI hardware and software roadmaps and grow our data center GPU footprint. Turning to our Client segment, revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase of 85% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our latest-generation Ryzen mobile and desktop processors with OEMs and in the channel. Client segment revenue declined 6% sequentially. We saw strong demand for our latest-generation Ryzen processors in the first quarter. Ryzen desktop CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, and Ryzen mobile CPU sales nearly doubled year-over-year as new Ryzen 8040 notebook designs from Acer, Asus, HP, Lenovo and others ramped. We expanded our portfolio of leadership enterprise PC offerings with the launch of our Ryzen Pro 8000 processors earlier this month. Ryzen Pro 8040 mobile CPUs delivered industry-leading performance in battery life for commercial notebooks. And our Ryzen Pro 8000 series desktop CPUs are the first processors to offer dedicated, on-chip AI accelerators in commercial desktop PCs. We see clear opportunities to gain additional commercial PC share based on the performance and efficiency advantages of our Ryzen Pro portfolio and an expanded set of AMD-powered commercial PCs from our OEM partners. Looking forward, we believe the market is on track to return to annual growth in 2024, driven by the start of an enterprise refresh cycle and AI PC adoption. We see AI as the biggest inflection point in PC since the Internet, with the ability to deliver unprecedented productivity and usability gains. We're working very closely with Microsoft and a broad ecosystem of partners to enable the next generation of AI experiences, powered by Ryzen processors, with more than 150 ISVs on track to be developing for AMD AI PCs by the end of the year. We will also take the next major step in our AI PC roadmap later this year with the launch of our next-generation Ryzen mobile processors codenamed Strix. Customer interest in Strix is very high based on the significant performance and energy efficiency uplifts we are delivering. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 48% year-over-year and 33% sequentially to $922 million. First quarter semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle. In Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year and sequentially. We expanded our Radeon 7000 Series family with the global launch of our Radeon RX 7900 GRE and also introduced our driver-based AMD fluid motion frames technology that can provide large performance increases in thousands of games. Turning to our Embedded segment. Revenue decreased 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially to $846 million as customers remain focused on normalizing their inventory levels. We launched our Spartan UltraScale+ FPGA family with high I/O counts, power efficiency and state-of-the-art security features, and we're seeing a strong pipeline of growth for our cost-optimized embedded portfolio across multiple markets. Given the current embedded market conditions, we're now expecting second quarter embedded segment revenue to be flat sequentially, with a gradual recovery in the second half of the year. Longer term, we see AI at the edge as a large growth opportunity that will drive increased demand for compute across a wide range of devices. To address this demand, we announced our second generation of Versal adaptive SoCs that deliver a 3x increase in AI tops per watt and a 10x greater scalar compute performance compared to our prior generation of industry-leading adaptive SoCs. Versal Gen 2 adaptive SoCs are the only solution that combine multiple compute engines to handle AI preprocessing, inferencing and post-processing on a single chip, enabling customers to rapidly add highly performant and efficient AI capabilities to a broad range of products. We were pleased to be joined at our launch by Subaru, who announced they adopted Versal AI Edge series Gen 2 devices to power the next generation of their EyeSight ADAS system. Embedded Design win momentum remains very strong as customers adopt our full portfolio of FPGAs, CPUs, GPUs and adaptive SoCs to address a larger portion of their compute needs. In summary, we executed well in the first quarter, setting us up to deliver strong annual revenue growth and expanded gross margin, driven by growing adoption of our Instinct, EPYC and Ryzen product portfolios. Our priorities for 2024 are very clear: accelerate our Data Center growth by ramping Instinct GPU production and gaining share with our EPYC processors; launch our next-generation Zen 5 PC and server processors that extend our leadership performance; and expand our adaptive computing portfolio with differentiated solutions. Looking further ahead, AI represents an unprecedented opportunity for AMD. While there has been significant growth in AI infrastructure build-outs, we are still in the very early stages of what we believe is going to be a period of sustained growth, driven by an insatiable demand for both high-performance AI and general-purpose compute. We have expanded our investments across the company to capture this large growth opportunity, from rapidly expanding our AI software stack to accelerating our AI hardware road maps, increasing our go-to-market activities and partnering closely with the largest AI companies to co-optimize solutions for their most important workloads. We are very excited about the trajectory of the business and the significant growth opportunities ahead. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our first quarter results. Jean?",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth in our Data Center and Client segments in the fourth quarter and grew 230 basis points of gross margin expansion. For the first quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.5 billion, up 2% year-over-year as revenue growth in the Data Center and the Client segment was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segments. Revenue declined 11% sequentially as higher Data Center revenue resulting from the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs was offset by lower Gaming and Embedded segment revenues. Gross margin was 52%, up 230 basis points year-over-year, driven by higher revenue contribution from the Data Center and Client segments, partially offset by lower Embedded and Gaming segment revenue contribution. Operating expenses were $1.7 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, as we continued investing aggressively in R&D and marketing activities to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us. Operating income was $1.1 billion, representing a 21% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense and other was $120 million. For the fourth quarter of 2024, diluted earnings per share was $0.62, an increase of 3% year-over-year. Now turning to our Reportable segment, starting with the Data Center. Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.3 billion, up 80%, a $1 billion increase year-over-year. Data Center accounted for more than 40% of total revenue, primarily led by the ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs from both cloud and enterprise customers and a strong double-digit percentage growth in our server process revenue as a result of growth across our sample products. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 2%, driven by the ramp of our AMD Instinct GPUs, partially offset by a seasonal decline in server CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $541 million or 23% of revenue compared to $148 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up 266% year-over-year due to operating leverage even as we significantly increased our investment in R&D. Client segment revenue was $1.4 billion, up 85% year-over-year, driven primarily by Ryzen 8000 series processors. On a sequential basis, Client revenue declined 6%. Client segment operating income was $86 million or 6% of revenue compared to an operating loss of $172 million a year ago, driven by higher revenue. Gaming segment revenue was $922 million, down 48% year-over-year and down 33% sequentially due to a decrease in semi-custom and Radeon GPU sales. Gaming segment operating income was $151 million or 16% of revenue compared to $314 million or 18% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $846 million, down 46% year-over-year and 20% sequentially as customers continue to manage their inventory levels. Embedded segment operating income was $342 million or 41% of revenue compared to $798 million or 51% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $521 million in cash from operations, and free cash flow was $379 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $301 million to $4.7 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of data center and client products in advanced process nodes. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent and short-term investment was $6 billion. As a reminder, we have $750 million of debt maturing this June. Given our ample liquidity, we plan to retire that utilizing existing cash. Now turning to our second quarter 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $5.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect Data Center segment revenue to increase by a double-digit percentage, primarily driven by the Data Center GPU ramp; client segment revenue to increase; embedded segment revenue to be flat; and in the Gaming segment, based on current demand signals, revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage. Year-over-year, we expect our Data Center and Client segment revenue to be up significantly, driven by the strength of our product portfolio; the Embedded and the Gaming segment revenue to decline by a significant double-digit percentage. In addition, we expect second quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.8 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13% and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. In closing, we started the year strong. We made significant progress on our strategic priorities, delivering year-over-year revenue growth in our Data Center and Client segments and expanded the gross margin. Looking ahead, we believe the investments we are making will position us very well to address the large AI opportunities ahead.",

Results have been positive so far, and we currently see increased interest from both existing and new customers committing to MI300. This encourages us to raise our forecast from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. The market is dynamic, and we are engaging with over 100 customers in both development and deployment. Overall, the ramp is strong. Regarding the supply chain, I am pleased with how supply has increased. This is the fastest product ramp we have undertaken, despite the complexity involved with chiplets, CoWoS, 3D integration, and HBM. We have received great support from our partners, and we outperformed our initial expectations for the last quarter. I believe Q2 will also see significant ramping. We plan to increase supply every quarter this year. While we are currently tight on supply, there is strong demand for the product. We will continue to address these aspects throughout the year.

However, the demand for AI compute from our customers remains very robust, as evidenced by recent announcements from large cloud companies.  We maintain strong relationships with major AI companies, aiming to innovate collectively. When considering large language models and the requirements for training and inference, there will be a variety of solutions; no single solution will fit all needs. The GPU remains the favored architecture, particularly as algorithms and models advance, which benefits our architecture and our capability to optimize CPU with GPU.  I believe we are in a strong position with our partnerships and see a significant opportunity for collaborative innovation.

Everyone is increasing capacity as we progress through the year. Regarding visibility, we have good insight into the current situation, and we are engaged with our customers.

Second half, we do think the first half is the bottom of Embedded business and will start to see gradual recovery in the second half. And going back to your gross margin question, when you look at our gross margin expansion in both Q1 and the guide at Q2, the primary driver is the strong performance on the Data Center side. The Data Center will continue to ramp in the second half. I think that will continue to be the major driver of gross margin expansion in the second half.

Looks like you guys did drive a little bit more cloud instance adoption, but anything else that drove to a slightly better seasonal pattern in March for Data Center? Server?",

This relates to total cost of ownership for our customers, as well as our performance and energy efficiency, which typically results in a cost advantage for our customers. I think it's very important to say we are very supportive of the open ecosystem. We're very supportive of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. But I don't believe that, that is a limiter to our ability to build large-scale systems. I think Ethernet is something that many in the industry feel will be the long-term answer for networking in these systems, and we have a lot of work that we're doing with internally as well as with our customers and partners to enable that.",

So as we look out at these kinds of data centers, from an architectural standpoint, it's not a situation where winner takes all, where if somebody gets in, they kind of get all the sockets? Or will there reliance where your chip perhaps or your board can be placed right next to somebody else's board maybe on a separate line?

I think our view of that is, number one, we view that as a very attractive area for AMD. It's an area where we believe we have the technology to be very competitive there. And I think the desire would be to have optionality in terms of how you build those out. So obviously, a lot has to happen between here and there. But I think your overarching question of.

          "content": "Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered strong second-quarter financial results with revenue coming in above the midpoint of guidance and profitability increasing by a double-digit percentage driven by higher than expected sales of our Instinct, Ryzen, and EPYC processors. We continued accelerating our AI traction, as leading cloud and enterprise providers expanded availability of Instinct MI300X solutions, and we also saw positive demand signals for general-purpose compute in both our client and server processor businesses. As a result, second-quarter revenue increased by 9% year-over-year to $5.8 billion, as significantly higher sales of our data center and client processors more than offset declines in gaming and embedded product sales. We also expanded gross margin by more than 3 percentage points and grew EPS by 19%, as data center product sales accounted for nearly 50% of overall sales in the quarter. Turning to the segments, data center segment revenue increased 115% year-over-year to a record $2.8 billion, driven by the steep ramp of Instinct MI300 GPU shipments and a strong double-digit percentage increase in EPYC CPU sales. Cloud adoption remains strong as hyperscalers deploy fourth-gen EPYC CPUs to power more of their internal workloads and public instances. We are seeing hyperscalers select EPYC processors to power a larger portion of their applications and workloads, displacing incumbent offerings across their infrastructure with AMD solutions that offer clear performance and efficiency advantages. The number of AMD-powered cloud instances available from the largest providers has increased 34% from a year ago to more than 900. We are seeing strong pull for these instances with both enterprise and cloud-first businesses. As an example, Netflix and Uber both recently selected fourth-gen EPYC Public Cloud instances as one of the key solutions to power their mission-critical customer-facing workloads. In the enterprise, sales increased by a strong double-digit percentage sequentially. We closed multiple large wins in the quarter with financial services, technology, health care, retail, manufacturing, and transportation customers, including Adobe, Boeing, Industrial Light & Magic, Optiver, and Siemens. Importantly, more than one-third of our enterprise server wins in the first half of the year were with businesses deploying EPYC in their data centers for the first time, highlighting our success attracting new customers while also continuing to expand our footprint with existing customers. Looking ahead, our next-generation Turin family, featuring our new Zen 5 core, is looking very strong. Zen 5 is a ground-up new core design optimized for leadership performance and efficiency. Turin will extend our TCO leadership by offering up to 192 cores and 384 threads, support for the latest memory and I.O. technologies, and the ability to drop into existing fourth-gen EPYC platforms. We publicly previewed Turin for the first time in June, demonstrating our significant performance advantages in multiple compute-intensive workloads. We also passed a major milestone in the second quarter as we started Turin production shipments to lead Cloud customers. Production is ramping now ahead of launch, and we expect broad OEM and cloud availability later this year. Turning to our data center AI business, we delivered our third straight quarter of record data center GPU revenue, with MI300 quarterly revenue exceeding $1 billion for the first time. Microsoft expanded their use of MI300X Accelerators to power GPT-4 Turbo and multiple copilot services including Microsoft 365 Chat, Word, and Teams. Microsoft also became the first large hyperscaler to announce general availability of public MI300X instances in the quarter. The new Azure VMs leverage the industry-leading compute performance and memory capacity of MI300X in conjunction with the latest ROCm software to deliver leadership-inferencing price performance when running the latest frontier models, including GPT-4. Hugging Face was one of the first customers to adopt the new Azure instances, enabling enterprise and AI customers to deploy hundreds of thousands of models on MI300X GPUs with one click. Our enterprise and Cloud AI customer pipeline grew in the quarter, and we are working very closely with our system and cloud partners to ramp availability of MI300 solutions to address growing customer demand. Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and Supermicro all have Instinct platforms in production, and multiple hyperscale and tier-2 cloud providers are on track to launch MI300 instances this quarter. On the AI software front, we made significant progress enhancing support and features across our software stack, making it easier to deploy high-performance AI solutions on our platforms. We also continued to work with the open-source community to enable customers to implement the latest AI algorithms. As an example, AMD support for the Flash Attention 2 algorithm was upstreamed, providing out-of-the-box support for AMD hardware in the popular library that could increase training and inference performance on large transformer models. Last week, we were proud to note that multiple partners used ROCm and MI300X to announce support for the latest Llama 3.1 models, including their 405 billion parameter version that is the industry's first frontier-level open-source AI model. Llama 3.1 runs seamlessly on MI300 accelerators, and because of our leadership memory capacity, we're also able to run the FP16 version of the Llama 3.1 405B model in a single server, simplifying deployment and fine-tuning of the industry-leading model and providing significant TCO advantages. Earlier this month, we announced our agreement to acquire Silo AI, Europe's largest private AI lab with extensive experience developing tailored AI solutions for multiple enterprise and embedded customers, including Allianz, Ericsson, Finnair, Korber, Nokia, Philips, T-Mobile, and Unilever. The Silo team significantly expands our capability to service large enterprise customers looking to optimize their AI solutions for AMD hardware. Silo also brings deep expertise in large language model development, which will help accelerate optimization of AMD inference and training solutions. In addition to our acquisitions of Silo AI, and Nod.ai, we have invested over $125 million across a dozen AI companies in the last 12 months to expand the AMD AI ecosystem, support partners, and advance leadership AMD computing platforms. Looking ahead from a roadmap perspective, we are accelerating and expanding our Instinct roadmap to deliver an annual cadence of AI accelerators, starting with the launch of MI325X later this year. MI325X leverages the same infrastructure as MI300 and extends our generative AI performance leadership by offering twice the memory capacity and 1.3 times more peak compute performance than competitive offerings. We plan to follow MI325X with the MI350 series in 2025 based on the new CDNA 4 architecture, which is on track to deliver a 35x increase in performance compared to CDNA 3. And our MI400 series powered by the CDNA Next architecture is making great progress in development and is scheduled to launch in 2026. Turning to our AI solutions work, Broadcom, Cisco, HP Enterprise, Intel, Google, Meta, and Microsoft all joined us to announce Ultra Accelerator Link, an industry standard technology to connect hundreds of AI accelerators that is based on AMD's proven infinity fabric technology. By combining UA-Link with the widely supported ultra-Ethernet consortium specification, the industry is coming together to establish a standardized approach for building the next generation of high-performance data centers and AI solutions at scale. In summary, customer response to our multi-year Instinct and ROCm roadmaps is overwhelmingly positive and we're very pleased with the momentum we are building. As a result, we now expect data center GPU revenue to exceed $4.5 billion in 2024, up from the $4 billion we guided in April. Turning to our client segment, revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of 49% year-over-year driven by strong demand for our prior-generation Ryzen processors and initial shipments of our next-generation Zen 5 processors. In PC applications, Zen 5 delivers an average of 16% more instructions per clock than our industry-leading previous generation of Ryzen processors. For desktops, our upcoming Ryzen 9000 series processors drop into existing AM5 motherboards and extend our performance and energy efficiency leadership across productivity, gaming, and content creation workloads. For notebooks, we announced our Ryzen AI 300 series that extends our industry-leading CPU and GPU performance and introduces the industry's fastest NPU with 50 TOPS of AI compute performance for Copilot Plus PCs. The first Ryzen AI 300 series notebooks went on sale over the weekend to strong reviews. And more than 100 Ryzen AI 300 series premium, gaming, and commercial platforms are on track to launch from Acer, ASUS, HP, Lenovo, and others over the coming quarters. Customer excitement for our new Ryzen processors is very strong, and we are well positioned for ongoing revenue share gains based on the strength of our leadership portfolio and design win momentum. Now turning to our gaming segment, revenue declined 59% year-over-year to $648 million as semi-custom SoC sales declined in line with our projections. Semi-custom demand remains soft, as we are now in the fifth year of the console cycle, and we expect sales to be lower in the second half of the year compared to the first half. In gaming graphics, revenue increased year-over-year driven by improved sales of our Radeon 6000 and 7000 series GPUs in the channel. Turning to our embedded segment, revenue decreased 41% year-over-year to $861 million. The first quarter marked the bottom for our embedded segment revenue. Although second-quarter revenue was flat sequentially, we saw early signs of order patterns improving and expect embedded revenue to gradually recover in the second half of the year. Longer-term we are building strong design win momentum for our expanded embedded portfolio. Design wins in the first half of the year increased by more than 40% from the prior year to greater than $7 billion, including multiple triple-digit million-dollar wins combining our adaptive and x86 compute products. We announced our Alveo V80 accelerators that deliver leadership capabilities in memory-intensive workloads and entered early access on next-generation Edge AI solutions with more than 30 key partners on our upcoming second-gen Versal adaptive SoCs. Last week, we also announced Victor Peng, President of AMD, would retire at the end of August. Victor has made significant contributions to Xilinx and AMD, including helping scale our embedded business and leading our cross-company AI strategy. On a personal note, Victor has been a great partner to me in sharing the success of our Xilinx acquisition and integration. On behalf of all of the AMD employees and board, I want to thank Victor for all of his contributions to AMD success and wish him all the best in his retirement. In summary, we delivered strong second-quarter results and are well positioned to grow revenue significantly in the second half of the year, driven by our data center and client segments. Our data center GPU business is on a steep growth trajectory as shipments ramp across an expanding set of customers. We're also seeing strong demand for our next-generation Zen 5 EPYC and Ryzen processors that deliver leadership performance and efficiency in both data center and client workloads. Looking ahead, the rapid advances in generative AI and development of more capable models are driving demand for more compute across all markets. Under this backdrop, we see strong growth opportunities over the coming years and are significantly increasing hardware, software, and solutions investments with a laser focus on delivering an annual cadence of leadership data center GPU hardware, integrating industry-leading AI capabilities across our entire product portfolio, enabling full-stack software capabilities, amplifying our ROCm development with the scale and speed of the open-source community, and providing customers with turnkey solutions that accelerate the time to market for AMD-based AI systems. We are excited about the unprecedented opportunities in front of us and are well positioned to drive our next phase of significant growth. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our second-quarter results.",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter. We're very pleased with our overall second-quarter financial results that came in above expectations. On a year-over-year basis, data center segment revenue more than doubled. Client segment revenue grew significantly, and we expanded the gross margin by 340 basis points. For the second quarter of 2024, revenue was $5.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year, as revenue growth in the data center and the client segments was partially offset by lower revenue in our gaming and embedded segments. Revenue increased 7% sequentially, primarily driven by growth in the data center and the client segments. Gross margin was 53%, up 340 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher data center revenue. Operating expenses were $1.8 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in R&D to address the significant AI growth opportunities ahead of us and enhanced go-to-market activities. Operating income was $1.3 billion representing a 22% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense, and other was $138 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.69, an increase of 19% year-over-year. Now turning to our reportable segment. Starting with the data center. Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $2.8 billion, up 115%, a $1.5 billion increase in year-over-year. The Data Center segment accounted for nearly 50% of total revenue, led primarily by the steep ramp of AMD Instinct GPUs and strong double-digit percentage EPYC Server revenue growth. On a sequential basis, revenue increased 21%, driven primarily by strong momentum in AMD Instinct GPUs. Data center segment operating income was $743 million or 26% of revenue compared to $147 million or 11% a year ago. Operating income was up more than 5 times from the prior year, driven by higher revenue and operating leverage, even as we significantly increase our investment in R&D. Client segment revenue was $1.5 billion, up 49% year-over-year and 9% sequentially driven primarily by AMD Ryzen processor sales. Client segment operating income was $89 million or 6% of revenue compared to operating loss of $69 million a year ago. Gaming segment revenue was $648 million, down 59% year-over-year and 30% sequentially. The decrease in revenue was primarily due to semi-customer inventory digestion and the lower-end market demand. Gaming segment operating income was $77 million, or 12% of revenue compared to $225 million or 14% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $861 million, down 41% year-over-year, as customers continue to normalize their inventory levels. On a sequential basis, embedded segment revenue was up 2%. Embedded segment operating income was $345 million or 40% of revenue compared to $757 million or 52% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $593 million in cash from operations and free cash flow was $439 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $339 million to $5 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of a data center GPU product. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $5.3 billion. In the second quarter, we returned $352 million to shareholders repurchasing 2.3 million shares, and we have $5.2 billion of authorization remaining. During the quarter, we retired $750 million of debt that matured this past June utilizing existing cash. Now turning to our third quarter, 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $6.7 billion plus or minus $300 million. Sequentially, we expect revenue to grow approximately 15%, primarily driven by strong growth in the data center and the client segment. We expect embedded segment revenue to be up and the gaming segment to decline by a double-digit percentage. Year-over-year we expect revenue to grow approximately 16%, driven by the steep ramp of our AMD Instinct processors and strong server and client revenue growth to more than offset the declines in the gaming and embedded segments. In addition, we expect third-quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 53.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $1.9 billion. Non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%. And the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. Also, during the third quarter, we expect to close the acquisition of Silo AI for approximately $665 million in cash. In closing, we made significant progress during the quarter toward achieving our financial goals. We delivered record MI300 revenue that exceeded $1 billion and demonstrated solid traction with our next-gen Ryzen and EPYC products. We expanded gross margin significantly and drove earnings growth while increasing investment in AI. Looking forward, opportunities ahead of us are unprecedented and we will remain focused on executing to our long-term growth strategy while driving financial discipline and operational excellence.

          "content": "Yes. Great, Ben. Thanks for the question. So first of all on MI300 and the customer evolution, we are very happy with how MI300 has progressed. When we started the year, I think the key point for us was to get our products into our customers' data centers, to have them qualify their workloads, to really ramp in production and then see what the production capabilities are especially performance and all of those things. And I can say now being more than halfway through the year, we've seen great progress across the board. As we look into the second half of the year, I think we would expect that MI300 revenue would continue to ramp in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we are continuing to expand both current deployments with our existing customers, as well as we have a large pipeline of customers that we are working through that are getting familiar with our architecture and software and all that stuff. So I'd say overall, very pleased with the progress, and really continuing right on track to what we expected from the capabilities of the product. As we go into next year, I mean one of the important things that we announced at Computex was increasing and expanding our roadmap. I think we feel really good about our roadmap. We are on track to launch MI325 later this year. And then next year, our MI350 series, which will be very competitive with Blackwell Solutions. And then we're well on our way to our CDNA Next as well. So I think overall we remain quite bullish on the overall AI market. I think the market continues to need more compute. And we also feel very good that our hardware and software solutions are getting good traction, and we are continuing to expand that pipeline.",

We have seen broad adoption across cloud platforms as well as strong focus on enterprise and third-party cloud instances. We are starting to see good traction in enterprise among both new and existing customers, and we are also witnessing an increase in third-party cloud adoption. Overall, our EPYC portfolio has been successful. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we feel optimistic. The market appears to be improving, with signs of increased spending in both enterprise and cloud sectors. Additionally, we are in the process of launching Turin, which began production in the second quarter, and we expect to roll it out widely in the second half of the year, contributing to our revenue.

Does the greater than $4.5 billion, does that include any revenue from 325? And can you talk a little bit more about 350? Obviously, we are seeing a big rack-scale or shift toward rack-scale systems for the competition's product. And I'm wondering if that's what 350 is going to look like. Is it going to have liquid cooling and is it going to have a rack-scale aspect to it? Thanks.",

From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter, but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities. And 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year. And then as we look at the 350 series, what we are seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled. In spending time with our customers, I think there are people who certainly want more rack-level solutions, and we are certainly doing much more in terms of system-level integration for our products. You will see us invest more in system-level integration. But we also have many customers who want to use their current infrastructure. I think the beauty of the MI350 series is, it actually fits into the same infrastructure as the MI300 series. And so it would lend itself to, let's call it, a pretty fast ramp if you've already invested in 300 or 325. So we see the range of options, and that's part of the expansion of the roadmap that we are planning.",

So we just actually launched the first Strix-based notebooks over the weekend. They went on sale. You may have seen some of the reviews. The reviews are very positive. Our view of this is the AI PC is an important add to the overall PC category. As we go into the second half of the year, I think we have better seasonality in general, and we think we can do, let us call it above-typical seasonality, given the strength of our product launches and when we are launching. And then into 2025, you're going to see AI PCs across sort of a larger set of price points which will also open up more opportunities. So overall, I\u2019d say, the PC market is a good revenue growth opportunity for us. The business is performing well. The products are strong.

And I remember when the Naples product launched, there was a lot of, I\u2019d say, reaction positively and negatively and sort of sentiment around where your roadmap might go to relatively small perturbations in what the volumes were, super early. But if I remember back to that, what was the most important was that was the toehold into the market for long-term engagement, both on the software side and the hardware side with your customers two, three, four generations forward. So is that an accurate parallel to where you guys are with MI300?

Our software has been deployed in various environments, and it has matured significantly. ROCm has seen great improvements in features, functions, and out-of-box performance, boosting our confidence through this process. We are also continuing to invest in the networking aspects of building out the rack scale and system-level components. Engaging in long-term discussions across multiple generations is essential.

And then relative to the various choices for the size of the market, I firmly believe that there will be multiple solutions, whether you are talking about GPUs or you are talking about custom chips or ASICs, there will be multiple solutions. In our case, I think we've demonstrated a really strong roadmap and the ability to partner well with our customers. And from the standpoint of that deep engagement, hardware, software co-optimization is so important in that. And for large language models, GPUs are still the architecture of choice.

We continue to see line of sight to continue increasing supply as we go through the second half of the year. But I will say that the overall supply chain is tight and will remain tight through 2025. So under that backdrop, we have great partnerships across the supply chain. We've been building additional capacity and capability there. And so we expect to continue to ramp as we go through the year.

Over time, in the longer term, we do believe gross margin will be accretive to corporate average. From a profitability perspective, AMD always invests in platforms. If you look at our Data Center platform especially both the Server and the Data Center GPU side, we are ramping the revenue. The business model can leverage very significantly even from the GPU side. Because the revenue ramp has been quite significant, the operating margin continued to expand. We definitely want to continue to invest as the opportunity is huge.

When considering our second quarter revenue, it is almost entirely from AI, specifically the MI300X for large AI, hyperscalers, and OEM customers targeting enterprise and Tier 2 data centers.  In terms of what we're doing, regarding memory, there is a lot of noise in the system that I wouldn't focus on. We've experienced an incredible ramp, and I'm genuinely proud of the team for achieving the fastest product ramp to over $1 billion in the second quarter, with continued growth in the third and fourth quarters. We have multiple suppliers qualified on HBM3, and while memory can be tricky, we've managed it effectively and are also qualifying HBM3E for future products with various memory suppliers. The exciting part is how much better the ROCm capability has improved due to extensive customer usage. We focus on out-of-box performance and how quickly customers can get started with the MI300. Depending on the software used, particularly with higher-level frameworks like PyTorch, customers can be up and running in just a few weeks, which is fantastic for expanding our overall portfolio. We will keep investing in software, which is why we acquired Silo AI, bringing in 300 skilled scientists and engineers with experience in AMD hardware to assist customers.  We view this as an opportunity to grow our customer base with talent from Silo AI and Nod.ai, which provided substantial compiler expertise, while we continue to hire organically.

          "content": "Yes, Chris, thank you for your question. We have made significant progress this year in expanding our gross margin, increasing it from 50% in 2023 to an expected 53.5% for Q3. The main reason for this growth is the rapid expansion of our Data Center business, which has increased its revenue contribution from 37% in Q4 of last year to nearly 50% now. This growth is a key factor in our gross margin improvement. In the second half of the year, we anticipate that the Data Center will continue to be the primary contributor to our revenue growth and help with margin expansion, although there are various factors to consider. As Lisa mentioned, the PC business is expected to perform better in the second half, typically driven more by consumer demand during this season, which introduces different dynamics. Additionally, we expect our Embedded business to show sequential growth each quarter, but its recovery will be gradual. Given these factors, the pace of our gross margin expansion may vary, but we do expect continued growth in gross margins. Regarding the MI300, we are confident that it will positively impact our overall average in the long term, and we believe that the Data Center business will remain a strong driver for our gross margin expansion.",

          "content": "Thank you, Mitch, and good afternoon to all those listening today. We delivered strong top- and bottom-line growth in the third quarter with revenue coming in above expectations, driven by record Instinct and EPYC product sales and robust demand for our Ryzen PC processors. Third quarter revenue increased 18% year-over-year to a record $6.8 billion as significantly higher Data Center and Client Processor sales more than offset declines in Gaming and Embedded product sales. We expanded gross margin by 2.5 percentage points and increased earnings per share by 31% year-over-year as Data Center segment revenue more than doubled. Turning to the segments. Data Center segment revenue increased 122% to a record $3.5 billion. We believe we gained server CPU share in the quarter as Enterprise wins accelerated. Cloud providers expanded their use of EPYC CPUs across their infrastructure, and we began the initial ramp of fifth-gen EPYC processors. EPYC has become the CPU of choice for the modern data center and our multi-generation product portfolio delivers leadership performance and significant total cost of ownership advantages across virtually every enterprise and cloud workload. In cloud, EPYC CPUs are deployed at scale to power many of the most important services, including Office 365, Facebook, Teams, Salesforce, SAP, Zoom, Uber, Netflix, and many more. Meta alone has deployed more than 1.5 million EPYC CPUs across their global data center fleet to power their social media platforms. Cloudflare selected general-purpose X processors with our industry-leading 3D chiplet stacking technology to power their next-generation servers that support twice as many requests per second and deliver 60% higher performance per watt compared to their prior generation. Public cloud instances increased 20% year-over-year to more than 950 as Microsoft, AWS, and others launched or expanded their EPYC processor-powered offerings in the quarter. EPYC instance adoption with Enterprise customers also grew in the quarter, highlighted by wins with Adobe, Boeing, Micron, Nestle, Slack, Synopsys, Tata, and others. In the Enterprise, sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year for the fifth straight quarter as EPYC CPU adoption accelerated and sell-through momentum grew. Dell, HPE, Lenovo, and others have expanded the number of fourth-gen EPYC platforms they offer by 50% in the last year. There are now more than 200 different EPYC solutions available that are optimized for a broad range of enterprise and edge workloads. We are building strong momentum with large Enterprise customers, highlighted in the third quarter by wins with large technology, energy, financial services, and automotive companies including Airbus, Daimler Truck, FedEx, HSBC, Siemens, Walgreens, and others. We launched our next-generation Turin family earlier this month that delivers absolute performance and total cost of ownership leadership across both Enterprise scale up and Cloud-native scale-out workloads. Turin has already set more than 130 performance records for virtualization, database, AI, business applications, and energy efficiency, with the full EPYC portfolio accounting for more than 500 performance world records. More than 130 fifth-gen EPYC enterprise platforms are in development from all the leading server OEMs and ODMs. These new servers complement existing fourth-gen EPYC platforms providing a top-to-bottom stack of platforms optimized for a broad range of business applications. In Cloud, Google and OCI announced plans to launch fifth-gen EPYC instances early next year, and we expect broad adoption with our largest cloud customers based on the significant performance and efficiency advantages of Turin. As an example, Oracle's Turin instances delivered 35% higher performance per core, 33% faster memory speeds, and double the networking bandwidth delivering a level of compute performance and capability that is only possible with EPYC CPUs. Looking ahead, we are very well positioned for continued growth in share gains based on the strength of our broad EPYC portfolio and the momentum we have built with Cloud and Enterprise customers. We also took a major step in the quarter to advance the x86 architecture, forming an ecosystem advisory group with Intel, several industry luminaries, and the largest cloud PC and enterprise leaders to accelerate innovation by driving consistency and compatibility across both the x86 instruction set and architectural interfaces and ensuring we evolve x86 as a compute platform of choice for developers and customers. Turning to our Data Center AI business, Data Center GPU revenue ramped as MI300X adoption expanded with cloud, OEM, and AI customers. Microsoft and Meta expanded their use of MI 300X accelerators to power their internal workloads in the quarter. Microsoft is now using MI 300X broadly for multiple co-pilot services powered by the family of GPT-4 models. Meta announced they have optimized and broadly deployed MI 300X to power their inferencing infrastructure at scale, including using MI300X exclusively to serve all live traffic for the most demanding Llama 405B frontier model. We are also working closely with Meta to expand their Instinct deployments to other workloads where MI300X offers total cost of ownership advantages, including training. MI300X public cloud instance availability expanded in the quarter with Microsoft, Oracle Cloud, and multiple AI-specialized cloud providers now offering Instinct instances with leadership performance and total cost of ownership for many of the most widely used models. Instinct cloud instance adoption is strong with multiple start-ups and industry leaders adopting MI300 instances to power their models and services, including Essential AI, Fireworks AI, Luma AI, and Databricks. On the AI software front, since launching MI300 10 months ago, we have expanded functionality at every layer of the ROCm stack and increased the number of models that run out of the box on Instinct accelerators to more than 1 million, enabling customers to get up and running as fast as possible with maximum out-of-the-box performance. With the release of ROCm 6.2 last quarter, MI300X inferencing performance has improved 2.4 times since launch, and trading performance has increased by 80%. We are working closely with a growing number of marquee Cloud and Enterprise customers to fine-tune their specific inferencing workloads for MI300, with many customers seeing 30% higher performance compared to competitive offerings. We continue to expand our work with the open-source community, broadening support for key frameworks like JAX, libraries like vLLM, and hardware-agnostic compilers like Triton. At our advancing AI event earlier this month, we were excited to be joined by the creators and leaders of some of the most important AI software technologies who have added foundational support for ROCm into Triton, the Llama Stack, SGLang, vLLM, and TensorFlow and are working to enable broader open-source community work with Instinct platforms. With this growing support from the broader AI software ecosystem and the significant advances we have made in our software stack, ROCm now provides AI developers with a truly open software alternative that has been deployed and validated at scale. To expand our AI systems capabilities, we announced a definitive agreement to acquire ZT Systems, one of the leading providers of AI infrastructure to the world's largest hyperscale computing companies. The ZT team complements our silicon and software capabilities with critical systems expertise needed to deliver rack and cluster-level solutions. With ZT we will be able to design and validate our next-gen AI silicon and systems in parallel, greatly accelerating time to deploy instant accelerators at data center scale. Customer feedback has been very positive as the ZT acquisition enabled hyperscale customers to rapidly deploy AMD AI infrastructure at scale and provides OEMs and ODMs with optimized board and module designs for a wide range of differentiated Enterprise solutions. On the regulatory front, we made good progress as we recently passed the HSR waiting period required for U.S. approval. We remain on track to close the acquisition in the first half of 2025. As a reminder, we plan to divest ZT's industry-leading U.S.-based data center infrastructure manufacturing business at the close of the transaction and are pleased that we have received significant interest from a number of parties to date. Looking ahead, we launched our next-gen MI325X GPU earlier this month that extends our memory capacity and bandwidth advantages and delivers up to 20% higher inferencing performance compared to H200 and competitive training performance. Customer and partner interest for MI325X is high. Production shipments are planned to start this quarter with widespread system availability from Dell, HP, Lenovo, Super Micro, and others starting in the first quarter of 2025. Longer term, we have successfully accelerated our product development pace to deliver an annual cadence of new Instinct products. Our next-gen MI350-series silicon is looking very good and is on track to launch in the second half of 2025 with the largest generational increase in AI performance we have ever delivered. Development on our MI400 series based on the CDNA Next architecture is also progressing very well towards a 2026 launch. We have built significant momentum across our data center AI business with deployments increasing across an expanding set of Cloud, Enterprise, and AI customers. As a result, we now expect Data Center GPU revenue to exceed $5 billion in 2024, up from $4.5 billion we guided in July and our expectation of $2 billion when we started the year. Turning to our Client segment. Revenue was $1.9 billion, an increase of 29% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for our latest generation Zen 5 notebook and desktop processors. Desktop channel sales grew by a significant double-digit percentage led by the launch of our Ryzen 9000 series processors that deliver leadership productivity, gaming, and content creation performance. We are seeing strength across our Ryzen desktop portfolio and are on track to launch our next-gen Ryzen 9,000 X3D processors in November with leadership gaming performance. In mobile, Ryzen AI 300 Series sales ramped significantly from the prior quarter as Acer, HP, Lenovo, Asus, and others announced new consumer and commercial notebooks with leadership compute and AI performance. We made good progress expanding our presence in the commercial PC market in the quarter, closing multiple large deals with AstraZeneca, Bayer, Mazda, Shell, Volkswagen, and other Enterprise customers. We also launched our Ryzen AI Pro 300 Series family, the first CPUs with enterprise-class security, manageability, and AI capabilities for CoPilot Plus PCs. HP and Lenovo are on track to more than triple the number of Ryzen AI Pro platforms they offer in 2024, and we expect to have more than 100 Ryzen AI Pro commercial platforms in market next year, positioning us well for share gains as businesses refresh the hundreds of millions of Windows 10 PCs that will no longer receive Microsoft technical support starting in 2025. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 69% year-over-year to $462 million. Semi-custom sales declined as Microsoft and Sony reduced channel inventory. Sony announced the PS5 Pro with significant increases in graphics and ray tracing performance and AI-driven upscaling, featuring a new AMD semi-custom SoC that extends our multigenerational partnership. In Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year as we prepare for a transition to our next-gen Radeon GPUs based on our RDNA 4 architecture. In addition to a strong increase in gaming performance, RDNA 4 delivers significantly higher ray tracing performance and adds new AI capabilities. We are on track to launch the first RDNA 4 GPUs in early 2025. Turning to our Embedded segment, third quarter revenue decreased 25% year-over-year to $927 million. Embedded demand continues recovering gradually, led by strength in test and emulation offset by ongoing softness in the industrial market. Momentum continues building for our differentiated Versal family of adaptive SoCs, led by strong demand for our Versal premium VP 1902, which is the world's largest adaptive SoC in FPGA that is powering multiple platforms for all three of the largest EDA vendors. Our Versal portfolio is also being adopted broadly across multiple aerospace customers. As one example, SpaceX recently launched their latest generation broadband satellites powered by Versal AI Core adaptive SoCs. To build on this momentum, we taped out Telluride last quarter, the first product in our second-gen Versal family that delivers up to 10 times more compute and enables AI application acceleration on a single chip. Design win momentum is very strong across our portfolio, tracking to grow more than 20% year-over-year in 2024 and positioning us well to grow our embedded business faster than the overall market in the coming years. In summary, the business accelerated in the third quarter, and we expect strong demand for our Instinct EPYC and Ryzen processors to result in another quarter of significant year-over-year growth. Taking a step back, this month marks my 10th anniversary as AMD's CEO. In the last 10 years, we have successfully completed multiple arcs. First, by turning the Company around and setting the solid financial and operational foundation required for sustained growth. And then by transforming AMD into the high-performance and adaptive computing leader. While I'm incredibly proud of what we've accomplished, I'm even more excited about the unprecedented growth opportunities in front of us. Looking out over the next several years, we see significant growth opportunities across our Data Center, Client, and Embedded businesses driven by the nearly insatiable demand for more compute. Each of these opportunities is amplified exponentially by the rapid adoption of AI, which is enabling new experiences that will make high-performance computing an even more essential part of our daily lives. In the Data Center alone, we expect the AI accelerator total addressable market will grow at more than 60% annually to $500 billion in 2028. To put that in context, this is roughly equivalent to annual sales for the entire semiconductor industry in 2023. Beyond the Data Center, we are adding leadership AI capabilities across our product portfolio and partnering deeply with a broad ecosystem of partners to deliver differentiated AI solutions at scale. This is an incredibly exciting time for AMD as the breadth of our technology and product portfolios combined with our deep customer relationships and diversity of markets we address provide us with a unique opportunity as we execute our next arc and make AMD the end-to-end AI leader. Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our third quarter results.",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We are very pleased with our strong third quarter financial results. On a year-over-year basis, Data Center segment revenue more than doubled and the Client segment revenue grew 29%. We expanded gross margin by 250 basis points and drove earnings per share growth of 31%. For the third quarter of 2024, revenue was $6.8 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and the revenue growth in our Data Center and Client segment was partially offset by lower revenue in our Gaming and Embedded segment. Revenue increased 17% sequentially, primarily driven by growth in our Data Center and Client segment. Gross margin was 54%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by higher data center segment revenue. Operating expenses were $1.96 billion, an increase of 15% year-over-year as we continue to invest in R&D and go-to-market activities. Operating income was $1.7 billion, representing a 25% operating margin. Taxes, interest expense, and other was $211 million. Diluted earnings per share was $0.92, an increase of 31% year-over-year and 33% sequentially. Now turning to our reportable segments. Starting with the Data Center, Data Center delivered record quarterly segment revenue of $3.5 billion, up 122%, nearly a $2 billion increase year-over-year and an increase of 25% sequentially. Growth in revenue was led primarily by the strong ramp of AMD Instinct GPU shipment and growth in AMD EPYC CPU sales. The Data Center segment accounted for 52% of total revenue in the third quarter. Data Center segment operating income was $1 billion or 29% of revenue compared to $306 million or 19% a year ago. Data Center segment operating income more than tripled compared to the prior year, driven by higher revenue and operating leverage. Client segment revenue was $1.9 billion, up 29% year-over-year and 26% sequentially, driven primarily by strong demand for our Zen 5 AMD Ryzen processors. Client segment operating income was $276 million or 15% of revenue compared to operating income of $140 million a year ago or 10% of revenue, primarily driven by higher revenue, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Gaming segment revenue was $462 million, down 69% year-over-year and 29% sequentially, primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue. Gaming segment operating income was $12 million or 2% of revenue compared to $208 million or 14% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $927 million, down 25% year-over-year as customers continue to normalize their inventory levels. Revenue increased 8% sequentially as demand improved in several end markets. Embedded segment operating income was $372 million or 40% of revenue compared to $612 million or 49% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $628 million in cash from operations and the free cash flow was $496 million. Excluding certain nonrecurring payments related to acquisitions from operating cash flows, our free cash flow was $619 million. Inventory increased sequentially by $383 million to $5.4 billion, primarily to support the continued ramp of Data Center segment products. At the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investment was $4.5 billion. In the third quarter, we returned $250 million of cash to shareholders, repurchasing 1.8 million shares, and we have $4.9 billion of authorization remaining. Now turning to our fourth quarter of 2024 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $7.5 billion, plus or minus $300 million, up 22% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our Data Center and Client segment, more than offset by declines in the Gaming and Embedded segments. We expect revenue to be up approximately 10% sequentially, driven primarily by growth across Data Center, Client, and the Gaming segment. In addition, we expect fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.05 billion. Non-GAAP other net income to be $17 million, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. In closing, we're pleased with our strong execution in the third quarter. We delivered record revenue, along with the strong year-over-year expansion in gross margin and earnings per share growth. Looking ahead, we are very well positioned to deliver another record quarter of revenue in the fourth quarter, driven by continued momentum in our Data Center and Client segments. Importantly, we are making a strategic investment to position AMD as the end-to-end AI infrastructure leader and drive long-term profitable growth.

In general, when you look at 2024, our gross margin improvement has been primarily driven by the mix, especially Data Center business continue to be the strong growth driver of our business, accounting for more than 50% of our revenue mix, which helps us to improve gross margin. Looking to 2025, we're not going to guide specifically. But as you mentioned, the outputs and takes that will help us going forward, I would say first is, going forward, the largest growth driver is our Data Center business, both the CPU side and the GPU side, and you are absolutely right, we see our Enterprise Server business continue to expand. That will be a tailwind on gross margin side. And secondly, Embedded business is recovering gradually, but that will also help us with our gross margin. At the same time, we are also seeing our client business expansion nicely. Client business today is more focused on the consumer side, which tends to be below corporate average. That's something headwind we'll deal with. And lastly, I would say our team has done a great job to continue to improve operational efficiency. When we scale the Company next year, you can see we're going to benefit from economies of scale to continue to drive our operational efficiency to improve gross margin.",

Over the past few quarters, we have achieved several key customer milestones, including scaling in data centers and meeting reliability requirements, along with optimizing for specific workloads to ensure top-notch out-of-the-box performance. We've gained significant confidence as we've seen customers ramp up, and while everyone hopes for quicker results, we believe things are progressing well. We're now looking at exceeding $5 billion in revenue for 2024, which makes us optimistic. Heading into 2025, we feel positive about the market, which remains a strong area for capital expenditure. Our product portfolio is improving, drawing on insights from the MI300 ramp. We've enhanced customer support and engagement, out-of-the-box performance, and our open-source ecosystem, all critical for enabling customers to operate at scale and performance while optimizing their total cost of ownership. These factors give us a solid opportunity to grow with our existing customers across various workloads. For example, Meta mentioned expanding from inference on their large language models with Llama 3.1 to training workloads, and Microsoft has been an excellent partner in this journey. We are actively collaborating with major customers to fine-tune their software for our hardware, which presents exciting opportunities ahead.",

And we have with our accelerated road map actually closed a good part of that gap. I think MI325 is a great product. It's going to compete very well with H200, and the MI350 series will compete very well with Blackwell. In the overarching view of the world, frankly, the market continues to be constrained, particularly in the newer product generations. It takes a long time to go from shipping your first samples to actually ramping in volume production workloads. And I think one of the advantages that we have with our portfolio is that from a data center retrofit standpoint, it's actually a much easier ramp, just the infrastructure is the same.

We actually saw some of our highest sell-through, so it was a strong sell-through quarter. And obviously, it shows in the revenue results. I think on the notebook standpoint, our business tends to be more heavily consumer-weighted and so that is more of a second half story. There is good momentum around AI PCs. I mean we've looked at some of the activation rates of our newest risen AI300 processors and the activation rates are good. It's still very early in the AI PC cycle, but we are seeing some good momentum there. So, I think we'll see both units up and the ASPs will depend a little bit on the mix between Consumer and Enterprise and Desktop and Notebooks.

As you may recall, our EPYC progression from Zen 1 through Zen 4 has been strong, even during the Rome period. Building trust and familiarity with the product takes time, especially since, while both are GPUs, there are notable differences in the software environment. Customers need to feel comfortable with the workload ramp. From my perspective, the ramp rate is very promising\u2014it's the fastest product ramp I've experienced. I view this as a multi-generational journey, and we've always acknowledged that. Next year will focus on expanding both our customer base and workload. With the MI400 series, we believe we have an outstanding product. Overall, the ramp is progressing well, and we will continue to gain the trust and partnership of these large customers. Customers are very receptive to AMD, and we see this consistently; everyone is giving us a fair chance to earn their business, which is our goal.",

          "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon to all those listening today. 2024 was a transformative year for AMD. We successfully established our multi-billion dollar data center AI franchise. Launched a broad set of leadership products and gained significant server and PC market share. As a result, we delivered record annual revenue, grew net income 26% for the year, and more than doubled free cash flow from 2023. Importantly, the data center segment contributed roughly 50% of annual revenue, as Instinct and EPYC processor adoption expanded significantly with cloud, enterprise, and supercomputing customers. Looking at our financial results. Fourth quarter revenue increased 24% year-over-year to a record $7.7 billion, led by record quarterly data center and client segment revenue, both of which grew by a significant double-digit percentage. On a full year basis, annual revenue grew 14% to $25.8 billion as data center revenue nearly doubled and client segment revenue grew 52%, more than offsetting declines in our Gaming and Embedded segments. Turning to the segments. Data center segment revenue increased 69% year-over-year to a record $3.9 billion. 2024 marks another major inflection point for our server business, as share gains accelerated, driven by the ramp of fifth-gen EPYC Turin and strong double-digit percentage year-over-year growth in fourth-gen EPYC sales. In cloud, we exited 2024 with well over 50% share at the majority of our largest hyperscale customers. Hyperscaler demand for EPYC CPUs was very strong, driven by expanded deployments powering both their internal compute infrastructure and online services. Public cloud demand was also very strong with a number of EPYC instances increasing 27% in 2024 to more than 1,000. AWS, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft, and Tencent launched more than 100 AMD general purpose in AI instances in the fourth quarter alone. This includes new Azure instances powered by a custom-built EPYC processor with HBM memory that delivers leadership HPC performance based on offering 8x higher memory bandwidth compared to competitive offerings. We also built significant momentum with Forbes 2000 Global Businesses using EPYC in the cloud, as enterprise customers activated more than double the number of EPYC cloud instances from the prior quarter. This capped off a strong year of growth as enterprise consumption of EPYC in the cloud nearly tripled from 2023. Turning to enterprise on-prem adoption. EPYC CPU sales grew by a strong double-digit percentage year-over-year, as sales increased, and we closed high-volume deployments with Akamai, Hitachi, LG, ServiceNow, Verizon, Visa, and others. We are seeing growing enterprise pull based on the expanding number of EPYC platforms available and our increased go-to-market investments. Exiting 2024, there are more than 450 EPYC platforms available from the leading server OEMs and ODMs, including more than 120 Turin platforms that went into production in the fourth quarter from Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Super Micro, and others. Looking forward, Turin is clearly the best server processor in the world with more than 540 performance records across a broad range of industry standard benchmarks. At the same time, we are seeing sustained demand for both fourth and third gen-EPYC processors as our consistent roadmap execution has made AMD the dependable and safe choice. As a result, we see clear growth opportunities in 2025 across both cloud and enterprise based on our full portfolio of EPYC processors, optimized for leadership performance across the entire range of data center workloads and system price points. Turning to our data center AI business. 2024 was an outstanding year, as we accelerated our AI hardware roadmap to deliver an annual cadence of new Instinct accelerators, expanded our ROCm software suite with significant uplifts in inferencing and training performance, built strong customer relationships with key industry leaders, and delivered greater than $5 billion of data center AI revenue for the year. Looking at the fourth quarter, MI300X production deployments expanded with our largest cloud partners. Meta exclusively used MI300X to serve their Llama 405B frontier model on meta.ai and added Instinct GPUs to its OCP-compliant Grand Teton platform, designed for deep learning recommendation models and large-scale AI inferencing workloads. Microsoft is using MI300X to power multiple GPT 4-based Copilot services and launched flagship instances that scale up to thousands of GPUs for AI training and inference and HPC workloads. IBM, Digital Ocean, and several other AI-focused CSPs have begun deploying AMD Instinct accelerators for new instances. IBM also announced plans to enable MI300X on their Watson X AI and data platform for training and deploying enterprise-ready generative AI applications. Instinct platforms are currently being deployed across more than a dozen CSPs globally, and we expect this number to grow in 2025. For enterprise customers, more than 25 MI300 series platforms are in production with the largest OEMs and ODMs. To simplify and accelerate enterprise adoption of AMD Instinct platforms, Dell began offering MI300X as a part of their AI factory solution suite and is providing multiple ready-to-deploy containers via the Dell Enterprise Hub on Hugging Face. HPC adoption also grew in the quarter. AMD now powers five of the 10 fastest and 15 of the 25 most energy-efficient systems in the world, on the latest top 500 supercomputer list. Notably, the El Capitan system at Lawrence Livermore National Labs debuted as the world's fastest supercomputer, using over 44,000 MI300 AI APUs to deliver more than 1.7 exaflops of compute performance. Earlier this month, the high-performance computer center at the University of Stuttgart launched the Hunter supercomputer that also uses MI300A. Like El Capitan, Hunter will be used for both foundational scientific research and advanced AI projects, including training LOMs in 24 different European languages. On the AI software front, we made significant progress across all layers of the ROCm stack in 2024. Our strategy is to establish AMD ROCm as the industry's leading open software stack for AI, providing developers with greater choice and accelerating the pace of industry innovation. More than 1 million models on Hugging Face now run out of the box on AMD, and our platforms are supported in the leading frameworks like PyTorch and JAX, serving solutions like VLLM and compilers like OpenAI Triton. We have also successfully ramped large-scale production deployments with numerous customers using ROCm, including our lead hyperscale partners. We ended the year with the release of ROCm 6.3 that included multiple performance optimizations, including support for the latest flash attention algorithm that runs up to 3 times faster than prior versions and SG Lang runtime that enabled day-zero support for state-of-the-art models like DeepSeek V3. As a result of these latest enhancements, MI300X inferencing performance has increased 2.7 times since launch. Looking forward, we're continuing to accelerate our software investments to improve the out-of-the-box experience for a growing number of customers adopting Instinct to power their diverse AI workloads. For example, in January we began delivering biweekly container releases that provide more frequent performance and feature updates and ready-to-deploy packages, and we continue adding resources dedicated to the open-source community that enable us to build, test, and launch new software enhancements at a faster pace. On the product front, we began volume production of MI325X in the fourth quarter. The production ramp is progressing very well to support new customer wins. MI325 is well-positioned in the market, delivering significant performance and TCO advantages compared to competitive offerings. We have also made significant progress with a number of customers adopting AMD Instinct. For example, we recently closed several large wins with MI300 and MI325 at Lighthouse AI customers that are deploying Instinct at scale across both their inferencing and training production environments for the first time. Looking ahead, our next-generation MI350 series featuring our CDNA 4 architecture is looking very strong. CDNA 4 will deliver the biggest generational leap in AI performance in our history, with a 35 times increase in AI compute performance compared to CDNA 3. The silicon has come up really well. We were running large-scale LLMs within 24 hours of receiving first silicon, and validation work is progressing ahead of schedule. The customer feedback on MI350 series has been strong, driving deeper and broader customer engagements with both existing and net new hyperscale customers in preparation for at-scale MI350 deployments. Based on early silicon progress and the strong customer interest in the MI350 series, we now plan to sample lead customers this quarter and are on track to accelerate production shipments to mid-year. As we look forward into our multi-year AMD Instinct roadmap, I'm excited to share that MI400 series development is also progressing very well. The CDNA next architecture takes another major leap, enabling powerful rack-scale solutions that tightly integrate networking CPU and GPU capabilities at the silicon level to support Instinct solutions at data center scale. We designed CDNA next to deliver leadership AI and HPC flops while expanding our memory capacity and bandwidth advantages and supporting an open ecosystem of scale-up and scale-out networking products. We are seeing strong customer interest in the MI400 series for large-scale training and inference deployments and remain on track to launch in 2026. Turning to our acquisition of ZTE Systems. We passed key milestones in the quarter and received unconditional regulatory approvals in multiple jurisdictions, including Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. Cloud and OEM customer response to the acquisition has been very positive, as ZTE's Systems expertise can accelerate time to market for future Instinct accelerator platforms. We have also received significant interest in ZTE's manufacturing business. We expect to successfully divest ZTE's industry-leading U.S.-based data center infrastructure production capabilities shortly after we close the acquisition, which remains on track for the first half of the year. Turning to our client segment. Revenue increased 58% year-over-year to a record $2.3 billion. We gained client revenue share for the fourth straight quarter, driven by significantly higher demand for both Ryzen desktop and mobile processors. We had record desktop channel sell-out in the fourth quarter in multiple regions, as Ryzen dominated the best-selling CPU list at many retailers globally, exceeding 70% share at Amazon, Newegg, and numerous others over the holiday period. In mobile, we believe we had a record OEM PC sell-through share in the fourth quarter as Ryzen AI 300 Series notebooks ramp. In addition to growing share with our existing PC partners, we were very excited to announce a new strategic collaboration with Dell that marks the first time they will offer a full portfolio of commercial PCs powered by Ryzen Pro processors. The initial wave of Ryzen-powered Dell commercial notebooks is planned to launch this spring with the full portfolio ramping in the second half of the year, as we focus on growing commercial PC share. At CES, we expanded our Ryzen portfolio with the launch of 22 new mobile processors that deliver leadership compute, graphics, and AI capabilities. Our Ryzen processor portfolio has never been stronger with leadership compute performance across the stack. For AI PCs, we are the only provider that offers a complete portfolio of CPUs, enabling Windows Copilot+ experiences on premium ultrathin, commercial, gaming and mainstream notebooks. Looking into 2025, we are planning for the PC TAM to grow by a mid-single-digit percentage year-on-year. Based on the breadth of our leadership client CPU portfolio and strong design win momentum, we believe we can grow client segment revenue well ahead of the market. Now turning to our Gaming segment. Revenue declined 59% year-over-year to $563 million. Semi-custom sales declined as expected as Microsoft and Sony focused on reducing channel inventory. Overall, this console generation has been very strong, highlighted by cumulative unit shipments surpassing $100 million in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, we believe channel inventories have now normalized and semi-custom sales will return to more historical patterns in 2025. In Gaming Graphics, revenue declined year-over-year, as we accelerated channel sellout in preparation for the launch of our next-gen Radeon 9000 series GPUs. Our focus with this generation is to address the highest volume portion of the enthusiast gaming market with our new RDNA 4 architecture. RDNA 4 delivers significantly better ray tracing performance and adds support for AI-powered upscaling technology that will bring high-quality 4K gaming to mainstream players when the first Radeon 9070 series GPUs go on sale in early March. Now turning to our Embedded segment. Fourth quarter revenue decreased 13% year-over-year to $923 million. The demand environment remains mixed, with the overall market recovering slower than expected as strength in aerospace and defense and test and emulation is offset by softness in the industrial and communications markets. We continue expanding our adaptive computing portfolio in the quarter with differentiated solutions for key markets. We launched our Versal RF series with industry-leading compute performance for aerospace and defense markets, introduced our Versal premium series Gen 2, as the industry's first adaptive compute devices supporting CXL 3.1 and PCI Gen 6, and began shipping our next-gen Alveo card with leadership performance for ultra-low latency trading. We believe we gained adaptive computing share in 2024 and are well-positioned for ongoing share gains based on our design win momentum. We closed a record $14 billion of design wins in 2024, up more than 25% year-over-year, as customer adoption of our industry-leading adaptive computing platforms expands and we won large new embedded processor designs. In summary, we ended 2024 with significant momentum, delivering record quarterly and full-year revenue. EPYC and Ryzen processor share gains grew throughout the year, and we are well-positioned to continue outgrowing the market based on having the strongest CPU portfolio in our history. We established our multibillion-dollar data center AI business and accelerated both our Instinct hardware and ROCm software roadmaps. For 2025, we expect the demand environment to strengthen across all of our businesses, driving strong growth in our data center and client businesses and modest increases in our gaming and Embedded businesses. Against this backdrop, we believe we can deliver strong double-digit percentage revenue and EPS growth year-over-year. Looking further ahead, the recent announcements of significant AI infrastructure investments like Stargate, and latest model breakthroughs from DeepSeek and the Allen Institute highlight the incredibly rapid pace of AI innovation across every layer of the stack, from silicon to algorithms to models, systems and applications. These are exactly the types of advances we want to see as the industry invests in increased compute capacity, while pushing the envelope on software innovation to make AI more accessible and enable breakthrough generative and agentic AI experiences that can run on virtually every digital device. All of these initiatives require massive amounts of new compute and create unprecedented growth opportunities for AMD across our businesses. AMD is the only provider with the breadth of products and software expertise needed to power AI from end to end across data center, edge, and client devices. We have made outstanding progress building the foundational product, technology, and customer relationships needed to capture a meaningful portion of this market. And we believe this places AMD on a steep long-term growth trajectory, led by the rapid scaling of our data center AI franchise from more than $5 billion of revenue in 2024 to tens of billions of dollars of annual revenue over the coming years. Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jean to provide some additional color on our fourth quarter and full year results. Jean?",

          "content": "Thank you, Lisa, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. AMD executed very well in 2024, delivering record revenue of $25.8 billion, up 14%, driven by 94% growth in our data center segment and a 52% growth in our client segment, which more than offset headwinds in our gaming and embedded segments. We expanded gross margin by 300 basis points and achieved earnings per share growth of 25% while investing aggressively in AI to fuel our future growth. For the fourth quarter of 2024, Revenue was a record $7.7 billion, growing 24% year-over-year as strong revenue growth in the data center and client segment was partially offset by lower revenue in our gaming and embedded segments. Revenue was up 12% sequentially, primarily driven by the growth of client, data center, and gaming segments. Gross margin was 54%, up 330 basis points year-over-year due to a favorable shift in revenue mix with higher data center and client revenues and lower gaming revenue, partially offset by the impact of lower embedded revenue. Operating expenses were $2.1 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year, as we invest in R&D and marketing activities to address our significant growth opportunities. Operating income was a record of $2 billion, representing a 26% operating margin. Taxes, interest and other was a net expense of $249 million. For the fourth quarter of 2024 diluted earnings per share was $1.09, an increase of 42% year-over-year, reflecting the significant operating leverage of our business model. Now turning to our reportable segment, starting with the data center segment. Revenue was a record of $3.9 billion, up 69% year-over-year driven by strong growth, both AMD Instinct GPU and the fourth and the fifth generation AMD EPYC CPU sales. Data Center segment operating income was $1.2 billion or 30% of revenue compared to $666 million or 29% a year ago. Client segment revenue was a record of $2.3 billion, up 58% year-over-year, driven by strong demand for AMD Ryzen processors. Client segment operating income was $446 million or 19% of revenue compared to operating income of $55 million or 4% of revenue a year ago, driven primarily by operating leverage due from higher revenue. Gaming segment revenue was $563 million, down 59% year-over-year, primarily due to a decrease in semi-custom revenue. Gaming segment operating income was $50 million or 9% of revenue compared to $224 million or 16% a year ago. Embedded segment revenue was $923 million, down 13% year-over-year, as end-market demand continues to be mixed. Embedded segment operating income was $362 million or 39% of revenue compared to $461 million or 44% a year ago. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $1.3 billion in cash from operations and a record $1.1 billion for free cash flow. Inventory increased sequentially by $360 million to $5.7 billion. In the end of the quarter, cash, cash equivalent, and short-term investments were $5.1 billion. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased 1.8 million shares and returned 256 million to shareholders. For the year, we repurchased 5.9 million shares and returned 862 million to shareholders. We have a $4.7 billion remaining in our share repurchase authorization. Before I turn to our financial outlook, let me cover our financial segment reporting. Beginning with our first quarter fiscal year 2025 financial statement disclosures. We plan to combine the client and gaming segment into one single reportable segment to align with how we manage the business. Therefore, reporting three segments: data center, client with gaming, and the embedded. We'll continue to provide distinct revenue disclosures for our data center, client, gaming, and embedded businesses, consistent with our current reporting. Now turning to our first quarter of 2025 outlook. We expect revenue to be approximately $7.1 billion plus or minus $300 million, up 30% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in our data center and client businesses. More than offsetting a significant decline in our gaming business and a modest decline in our embedded business. We expect revenue to be down sequentially approximately 7%, driven primarily by seasonality across our businesses. In addition, we expect first quarter non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 54%. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $2.1 billion. Non-GAAP other net income to be $24 million, non-GAAP effective tax rate to be 13%, and the diluted share count is expected to be approximately 1.64 billion shares. In closing, 2024 was a strong year for AMD, demonstrating our disciplined execution to deliver revenue growth and expand earnings at a faster rate than revenue, all while investing in AI and the innovation to fuel long-term growth. Looking ahead, we will build on the momentum to drive double-digit percentage revenue growth and further accelerated earnings in 2025 and beyond.",

We would expect the client business and the embedded business to be down more than that, just given where seasonality is for those businesses. And then we would expect gaming business will be down a little less than that. And that's a little atypical from a seasonality standpoint, but we are coming off a year when there was a lot of, let\u2019s call it inventory normalization.

I think what we look at is certainly for the first year of the data center GPU business, we wanted to give some clear progression as it was going. The business is now at scale, actually now at over $5 billion. And as we go into 2025, I think our guidance will be more at the segment level with some color as to some qualitative color as to what's going on between the two businesses. And relative to your question about long-term growth rates, you are absolutely right. I mean I believe that the demand for AI compute is strong. And we've talked about a data center accelerator TAM upwards of $500 billion by the time we get out to 2028. I think all of the recent data points would suggest that there is strong demand out there. Without guiding for a specific number in 2025, one of the comments that we made is we see this business growing to tens of billions, as we go through the next couple of years. And that gives you a view of the confidence that we have in the business and particularly our roadmap is getting stronger with each generation, right? So MI300 was a great start. MI350 series is stronger and addresses a broader set of workloads including both inference as well as training. And then as we get into MI400 series, we see significant traction and excitement around what we can do there with rack-scale designs, and address the innovation that's going on there. So yes, we are bullish on the long-term, and we'll certainly give you progress as we go through each quarter in 2025.",

Like is there something so disruptive in what they have done, that reduces the overall market opportunity.

          "content": "Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Vivek. Yes, it's been a pretty exciting first few weeks of the year. I think the DeepSeek announcements, Allen Institute as well as some of the Stargate announcements talk about just how much the rate and pace of innovation that's happening in the AI world. So specifically relative to DeepSeek. Look, we think that innovation on the models and the algorithms is good for AI adoption. The fact that there are new ways to bring about training and inference capabilities with less infrastructure actually is a good thing because it allows us to continue to deploy AI compute and broader application space and more adoption. I think from our standpoint, we also like very much the fact that \u2013 we are big believers in open source. And from that standpoint, having open source models, looking at the rate and pace of adoption there, I think is pretty amazing. And that is how we expect things to go. So to the overall question, of how should we feel about it. I mean, we feel bullish about the overall cycle. And similarly, on some of the infrastructure investments that were announced with OpenAI and Stargate and building out, let's call it, massive infrastructure for next-generation AI. I think all of those say that AI is certainly on the very steep part of the curve. And as a result, we should expect a lot more innovation. And then on the ASIC point, let me address that because I think that is also a place where there is a good amount of discussion. I've always been a believer in you need the right compute for the right workload. And so with AI, given the diversity of workloads, large models, media models, small models, training, inference when you are talking about broad foundational models or very specific models, you're going to need all types of compute. And that includes CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs. Relative to our $500 billion plus TAM going out in time, we've always had ASIC as a piece of that. But my belief is, given how much change there is still going on in AI algorithms that ASICs will still be the smaller part of that TAM because it is a more, call it, specific workload optimized, whereas GPUs will enable significant programmability and adjustments to all of these algorithm changes. But when I look at the AMD portfolio, it really is across all of those pieces. So CPUs, GPUs. And we are also involved in a number of ASIC conversations, as well as customers want to really have an overall compute partner.",

And from a first half, second half statement, as I mentioned, we have some new important AI design wins that are going to be deployed with and MI300 and MI325 in the first half of the year.

So we should go through that. We don't believe there is some substantial inventory buildup. We actually think that what we're seeing is very strong adoption of our new products. So on the desktop side, we saw our highest sell-out in many years, as we went through the holiday season, launching our new gaming CPUs, frankly, they have been constrained in the market, and we've continued shipping very strongly through the month of January as we are catching up with some demand there. So desktop business was very strong. And on the notebook side, we also saw a number of our OEM partners launching new AI PCs with the slew of new bulk mobile part numbers that we announced at CES. We have our strongest PC portfolio on the mobile side with top to bottom Copilot+ PC compatible products, and those are playing very well into the market. So I think Q4 was strong. I know that there was some commentary about whether there were pull-ins relative to tariffs. We didn't see that in the fourth quarter. I think, as I said, we saw strong sellout. Going into the first quarter, we do expect seasonality in there. But the part of our business that is performing better than seasonality is the desktop portion of the business. And the mobile portion of the business is, let's call it, more typical seasonality. But overall, I think we are very bullish on our prospects to grow clients in 2025.

And then to your question on enterprise, I do believe we are seeing some strong traction in the enterprise. I think what's helping us there is, frankly, we've invested a lot more in go-to-market and the go-to-market investments are paying-off. The enterprise sales cycle is often a 6-month to 9-month sales cycle. But as we've invested more resources in it throughout 2024, we've seen that convert into a significant number of new POCs that are now converting into volume deployments. And as we go through into 2025, from a competitiveness standpoint, we have a very strong portfolio across every price point, every core count, every workload.

So in each of those points, we are increasing with a number of proof points. I think people want to see more clusters of ours. Certainly, on inference, we've shown great performance and total cost of ownership. We are now also have a number of training systems that we are putting on board. And the important part there is the networking. We have worked very closely with our partners on Ethernet. We believe that this is the right technology for the future. In addition to third-party networking solutions, we are also with our Pensando team developing our own in-house AI NIC that Forrest mentioned at our Q4 advancing AI event. And as we look forward, working with our customers, we are actually standing up full rack solutions at both the MI350 level as well as in the MI400 series.

The fact that this hardware has been successfully launched, and what we've learned from the initial MI300 deployments, are positive indicators given the overall deployment landscape. Regarding ASICs, there hasn't been a major change in discussions. Customers appreciate our work in inference but want to see us as a robust training option, which aligns with our planned roadmap for those solutions. On the software front, we've made significant investments in our training libraries, and the focus is on entering data centers and increasing the deployment of GPUs. Overall, we're making solid progress. I want to emphasize that while ASICs are part of the solution, they are also an integral component of AMD's offerings.

For some of the models currently available, the Q3 data center GPU numbers may be somewhat lower than expected, which could require some adjustments. Therefore, it wouldn't be correct to interpret it as you suggested. If we consider the growth from the second half of '24 to the first half of '25, it appears to be roughly flat, plus or minus.

We've expanded the design points for each of the core generation so that we have cloud native and then we have enterprise optimized low core count, high core count, highest performance, best perf per dollar. And I think as we do those things, I think we\u2019re continuing to grow share across both cloud and enterprise. And look, it is always very competitive. We take every design win with very seriously, but we are winning our fair share. And I think that's the strength of the product portfolio. And also, I think there is a good amount of trust for our delivery capability as we've built up our sort of our franchise over the last number of years.",

I'm curious what some of the major puts and takes are and those are the things that we should be cognizant of going into Q2 and more importantly, the second half. Given your data center commentary skewed more to the second half, I would expect margins to improve in the second half. But yes, if you can kind of run through the pluses and minuses, that would be really helpful. Thank you.",

Our gross margin is primarily driven by our revenue mix, I think when you look at looking to 2025, Q1 guide, not only data center continued to grow significantly year-over-year. At the same time, client business is also growing year-over-year. So overall, the revenue mix is quite consistent with the Q4. So the gross margin guide is 54%. I think for the first half, if the revenue mix is at this level, we do feel the gross margin will be consistent with 54%. But going into second half, we do believe the data center is our fastest growth driver for the company and that will drive the gross margin to step up in the second half.",

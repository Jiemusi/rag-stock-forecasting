          "content": "Thank you, Peter. Welcome, everyone. I will first review the first quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2022. Net sales came in at \u20ac3.5 billion, which is at the high end of guidance. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized \u20ac591 million revenue from three systems this quarter. Net system sales of \u20ac2.3 billion, which was nicely balanced between logic at 50% and 50% from memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.2 billion, as guided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at the guidance of 49.0%. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at \u20ac739 million, and SG&A expenses at \u20ac208 million. R&D was below guidance, as fund rates in the quarter were lower than planned and will move to Q2. We still expect to be around 14% of sales for the year. Net income in Q1 was \u20ac695 million, representing 19.7% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac1.73. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at a level of \u20ac4.7 billion. Moving to the order book, Q1 net system bookings came in at \u20ac7.0 billion, including \u20ac2.5 billion for 0.33 EUV NA systems and multiple EUV 0.55 NA system, EXE:5200. Another very strong DPV order intake of \u20ac4.5 billion this quarter, reflecting the continued strong demand for advanced and mature nodes. Total net system bookings were driven by logic with 66% of the bookings and memory accounting for the remaining 34%. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2022. We expect Q2 total net sales to be between \u20ac5.1 billion and \u20ac5.3 billion. This excludes around \u20ac800 million of net delayed revenue for Q2 as a result of more fast shipments at the end of Q2 than at the end of Q1. We expect our Q2 installed base management sales to be around \u20ac1.2 billion. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 49% and 50%. Relative to last quarter, we expect a positive margin impact from higher volume for both EUV and DPV, offset by lower EUV ASP, DPV mix, and continued cost pressure in the quarter. The expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around \u20ac790 million and SG&A is expected to come in at around \u20ac220 million. In the current environment, it is also appropriate to address how we may be impacted by rising costs this year. We're not immune to rising costs. There is pressure on labor costs as the global job market for engineers is tight, and there is competition for talent. Costs related to components in the supply chain are also increasing due to higher material costs, including additional fees to secure parts. Transportation costs have increased due to rising fuel costs and changing flight routes. Energy contracts and renewable energy help limit the increased energy cost impacts. We clearly see pressure on margins due to these cost increases, which we expect to translate roughly to a 1% impact on gross margin for the full year 2022. We expect the second half of the year to be strong with expected gross margins of around 54%, primarily driven by higher EUV and DPV volume as well as improved margin from the installed base business. In summary, we currently expect gross margin to be closer to 52% for the year. Our estimated 2022 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. In Q1 2022, ASML acquired 3.6 million shares for a total amount of around \u20ac2.1 billion as part of our current program. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",

          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, revenue and profitability for the quarter came in as guided with system revenue balanced between logic and memory. We expect a step-up in sales in Q2 as revenue from fast shipments in Q1 will be recognized. While supply chain challenges are still present, we will continue to utilize fast shipments as a means to get systems to customers as soon as possible. Although the current macroeconomic environment creates uncertainty, we believe the fundamental growth drivers remain intact. We continue to see unprecedented customer demand across all market segments from both advanced and mature nodes, driving demand across our entire product portfolio. We are running at maximum capacity and expect demand to exceed supply well into next year. Our view of the full year revenue, therefore, remains unchanged with year-on-year growth of around 20% over 2021. As mentioned last quarter, this 20% sales growth does not include the full shipment value of systems out for this year due to a number of fast shipments, which will result in delayed revenue into 2023. For our EUV business, we still expect to ship around 55 systems this year. And as we plan to do fast shipments on a number of these systems, including systems in Q4, we expect some revenue to be deferred to 2023. This translates to an expected system revenue of around \u20ac7.8 billion this year. In our deep UV and applications business, we expect significant growth in both immersion and dry systems, as well as continued demand for metrology and inspection systems. In addition to advanced nodes, we see growing demand for deep UV systems supporting mature market segments, such as analog, power, and sensors. These market segments are part of the secular growth drivers in support of digital infrastructure, which includes automotive and green energy applications. We expect revenue growth of over 20% for non-EUV system revenue. For the Installed Base Management business, service revenue will continue to scale with the growing installed base of systems. Customers continue to look at all methods to add wafer capacity, including productivity upgrades. In these times of very high fab utilization, some of these upgrades are hardware-intensive and require systems to be taken offline for installation. Therefore, available system time will dictate their ability to install these types of upgrades. As we mentioned in previous quarters, the quickest way to add wafer capacity is to install software productivity packages. These upgrades require less system downtime and have now been installed in most of our customer fabs. We currently expect 2022 installed base revenue to be up around 10% year-on-year. Looking at the market segments in 2022, our view on growth is similar to last quarter. We still expect logic system revenue to be up more than 20% year-on-year, and memory system revenue to be up around 25% year-on-year. On High-NA EUV, we're making good progress. And we have currently started the integration of the first High-NA system in our new clean room in Veldhoven. We received multiple orders for our EXE:5200 system in Q1. We also received additional EXE:5200 orders this month, April. With these bookings, we now have High-NA orders with three Logic and two Memory customers. The EXE:5200 is ASML's next model High-NA system and will provide the next step for lithography performance and productivity. The global market trends that we talked about at our Investor Day last year are broadening the application space and providing secular growth drivers for future demand. The strong demand this year and beyond is reflected in the significant bookings over the past several quarters, resulting in a backlog of around \u20ac29 billion, which is an all-time high. We expect the strong order intake to continue as demand will continue to exceed supply also going well into next year. With multiple countries pursuing technological sovereignty, we are now seeing a number of announcements from customers for new fabs in the coming years in support of this global trend. These announced investments are expected to have a positive impact on medium-term demand. As this unprecedented demand is exceeding our capacity, ASML and its supply chain partners are planning to actively add capacity to meet future customer demand, as communicated during Investor Day last year. But at that time, we talked about the current capacity ramp is expected to deliver an output capability of over 70 EUV, 0.33 NA systems and around 375 deep UV systems by 2025. As mentioned last quarter, we see a need to further increase our output beyond this level in order to meet the stronger and longer market demand to support an industry that is expected to at least double by 2030. With the goal of adding more capacity, we're investigating the feasibility of increasing our annual capacity by 2025 to around 90 EUV 0.33 NA systems and 600 deep UV systems. For deep UV, we're planning to increase capacity for both immersion and dry, with a heavier weighting towards dry. We're also discussing with our supply chain partners to secure a capacity of around 20 EUV 0.55 High-NA systems in the medium term. Bear in mind that this translates to what we currently feel our maximum capacity goal should be and may therefore not be a final output plan. We discussed our goal recently with our supply chain partners and asked them to come back in the coming quarters, with confirmation on the feasibility of our request. Once we complete this analysis, we also expect to revisit our 2025 scenarios and growth opportunities beyond 2025. We plan to provide an update to the capital markets in the Q4 time frame. It is clearly a dynamic, challenging, but also exciting period in our industry, and it only increases our confidence in our long-term growth opportunity. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",

Based on some simple calculations, it seems that your backlog for DUV is around 500 tools, while you\u2019re shipping about 60 tools per quarter for DUV. Does this imply that the waiting period for DUV tools is currently over two years? Additionally, regarding your plans to increase DUV capacity, what would be your target for reducing that waiting time? Would you hope to get it back down to nine months in an ideal situation, or do you think we are facing a new reality where the backlog might remain for a considerable time?",

          "content": "Yes, two good questions, Rob. One, the DPV backlog is quite significant. You mentioned 500; it's actually a bit more. We're currently shipping around 60 units, but it's important to understand that we're increasing our shipping capability. Although we're not yet at the 600 units we mentioned, we expect to boost deep UV shipments this year and next year because we're making significant improvements in cycle time reduction and process efficiency. I believe that number will increase, so it won't remain stable. However, if you're looking to order a deep UV tool now, you'll be waiting until the second half of next year. This is due to the fact that the purchase order lead time is no longer relevant; it's about capacity lead time. We need to expand our capacity to fulfill more orders, and we anticipate that it will take at least two more years to increase our capacity by 20% to 25%. After that, we hope to return to a nine-month or shorter purchase order lead time. This is also why we currently see demand in deep UV, but we can only fulfill about 60% of that demand this year, constrained by our maximum capacity. Anything beyond that is truly a matter of capacity lead time, not just order time.",

As I mentioned earlier, we believe there is a very good chance that our customers\u2019 industry will more than double by the end of the decade, which means we will need additional capacity, a notion agreed upon by our suppliers. While we do want to support our suppliers, sometimes their financial limitations could arise, and we might step in to assist, as we've done in the past. This situation isn\u2019t a major concern, but it\u2019s about ensuring prompt execution. Generally, our suppliers are large enough to fund their own capital expenditures, so I don't foresee this being a significant problem. Regarding pricing, I believe the cost increases we've observed are primarily short-term. We follow a value pricing model rather than a cost-plus approach. However, the value of the wafers produced by our customers will also increase over time, which will be influenced by these cost increases. Consequently, going forward, our value pricing strategy will adjust the prices charged to our customers. This isn't just a short-term situation; it's intricately linked to the next 12 to 24 months, as we will see new volume purchase agreements reflecting these changes when the current ones expire.",

If we are going to assist suppliers, it may depend on their financial capabilities or any financial limitations they might encounter, and we might need to intervene as we've done previously, although this is not a significant concern. While it doesn't eliminate risk, it can help ensure quicker execution. Generally, our suppliers are large enough to manage their capital expenditures on their own, so I don\u2019t anticipate this being a major issue. Regarding pricing, the cost increases we have observed are primarily short-term. We implement value pricing rather than simply adding costs to our services. Moreover, the value of the wafers produced by our customers will increase over time, making the cost rise part of that dynamic. This means that going forward, value pricing will result in different pricing structures for our customers. Everything is interconnected, not just in the short term, but certainly over the next 12 to 24 months as existing volume purchase agreements expire, and we will have new agreements in place that reflect these changes.",

From my calculations, it seems your backlog for DUV tools is approximately 500 units, while you're currently shipping about 60 units per quarter.

While we haven't reached the 600 units we previously discussed, we expect to increase deep UV shipments throughout this year and next year.

This is because the lead time for purchase orders is no longer relevant; it\u2019s all about capacity lead-time. We need to build our capacity to fulfill more orders, and we estimate that it will take at least another two years to increase capacity by 20% to 25%. Once we achieve that, we expect to return to a lead-time of nine months or less for purchase orders. This situation also explains why, despite the current demand for deep UV tools, we can only fulfill about 60% of that demand this year due to our maximum capacity.

          "content": "Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2022. Net sales came in at \u20ac5.4 billion, slightly above our guidance. We shipped 14 EUV systems and recognized \u20ac2.0 billion revenue from 12 EUV systems this quarter. Net system sales of \u20ac4.1 billion were driven by Logic at 71%, with the remaining 29% from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.3 billion, above guidance. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 49.1%, which is at the lower end of our guidance, primarily due to increasing inflationary costs. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at \u20ac789 million and SG&A expenses at \u20ac222 million, as guided. Net income in Q2 was \u20ac1.4 billion, representing 26.0% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac3.54. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at \u20ac4.4 billion. Q2 net system bookings came in at a record \u20ac8.5 billion, reflecting continued strong customer demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Strong order intake of \u20ac5.4 billion for EUV 0.33 NA and EUV 0.55 NA systems and \u20ac3.1 billion for non-EUV systems. The total net system bookings were driven by Logic with 60% of the bookings and Memory accounting for the remaining 40%. Moving to our expectations for the third quarter of 2022, we are experiencing increasing supply chain constraints that resulted in delayed system starts and require us to increase the number of fast shipments in Q3 to supply our customers with systems in production as quickly as possible. We expect Q3 total net sales to be between \u20ac5.1 billion and \u20ac5.4 billion. This excludes around \u20ac1.1 billion of net delayed revenue for Q3 as a result of more fast shipments at the end of Q3 than at the end of Q2. We expect installed Base Management sales to be around \u20ac1.4 billion. Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 49% and 50%, similar to the prior quarter. The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around \u20ac810 million and SG&A is expected to come in at around \u20ac235 million. Our estimated 2022 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. In Q2, ASML paid a final dividend of \u20ac3.70 per ordinary share. Together with the interim dividend paid in 2021, this resulted in a total dividend for 2021 of \u20ac5.50 per ordinary share. We plan to grow our dividend and will move from a biannual to a quarterly dividend payout starting in Q3 this year. This will provide more timely return of cash to our investors and more evenly balance our cash across the year. The first quarterly interim dividend over 2022 will be \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share and will be made payable on August 12, 2022. In Q2 2022, we repurchased around 2.3 million shares for a total amount of around \u20ac1.2 billion. Total shares bought under the 2021-2023 program until the end of Q2 is around 12.4 million shares for a total amount of around \u20ac7.9 billion.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, revenue and profitability for the quarter basically came within guidance. We expect sales in Q3 to be in a similar guided range as Q2. Looking at the more near-term market dynamics, we see a couple of mixed messages. Some customers are indicating they are seeing signs of slowing demand in certain consumer-driven market segments, primarily PCs and smartphones. Other market segments like high-performance computing and automotive are still seeing strong demand. Litho tool utilization at our customers is still at very high levels while we are also seeing chip inventory levels trending towards pre-COVID levels. The demand for our systems still significantly exceeds supply this year and we see no change to this demand picture. We are planning to ship a record number of systems but we are faced with an increasing number of supply constraints, which seem likely to continue throughout the year. In an effort to recover from these delays, we are increasing the number of fast shipments to get systems to customers as quickly as possible. A fast shipment process skips some of the testing in our factory. Final testing and formal acceptance then takes place at the customer site. This leads to a deferral of revenue recognition for those shipments until formal customer acceptance but does provide our customers with earlier access to wafer output capacity. As fast shipments delay revenue recognition to subsequent quarters, we are seeing more delayed revenue that will move into next year. The value of fast shipments in 2022 leading to revenue recognition in 2023 is expected to increase from around \u20ac1 billion, as previously communicated, to around \u20ac2.8 billion, an increase of \u20ac1.8 billion. This results in \u20ac1.8 billion lower revenue recognition in 2022 and we now expect year-on-year revenue growth of around 10%. We began the year expecting a revenue growth of around 20%, or approximately \u20ac22.3 billion, but we are now expecting a revenue growth of around 10%, which is approximately \u20ac20.5 billion, and \u20ac2.8 billion value of fast shipments at the end of the year. For our EUV business, we still expect to ship 55 systems this year. As a result of the higher number of fast shipments, we now expect recognized EUV revenue this year on 40 systems to be around \u20ac6.4 billion, which is similar to revenue last year. Compared to last quarter's view, the number of EUV fast shipments in 2022 that will now be recognized as revenue in 2023 has increased by 9 systems to a total of 15 systems with a sales value of around \u20ac2.4 billion. We still expect significant growth in both immersion and dry systems in our deep UV and Applications business, as well as continued strong demand for metrology and inspection systems. Due to a higher number of fast shipments on deep UV systems, we now expect a revenue of around \u20ac8.6 billion or an increase of over 15%. We still expect 2022 installed base revenue to grow around 10% year-on-year. Regarding the market segments, there has been no change in customer demand. As the majority of the additional \u20ac1.8 billion of delayed revenue is EUV and therefore relates to the Logic segment, we now expect Logic system revenue to be up around 5% year-on-year and Memory system revenue to be up around 20% year-on-year. On gross margin, we started the year with an expectation of a gross margin for 2022 of around 53% and we adjusted this to 52% last quarter due to increased inflationary costs. There are a few developments that have further impact our expected gross margin for the year. First, the higher delayed revenue, an increase of \u20ac1.8 billion, relates to our higher margin EUV and immersion systems. Secondly, the supply chain issues lead to delayed system starts, and therefore we will have lower fixed cost coverage on a lower number of system starts this year compared to what we had planned last quarter. Fixed costs also increased due to our plans to ramp capacity faster in preparation for what is still expected to be a good growth year in 2023. Lastly, strong inflationary effects relating to material costs, freight, and labor continue to impact our cost of sales. A combination of these effects results in an expected 2022 gross margin between 49% and 50%. We are currently in discussions with our customers and suppliers to find a fair way to share in these inflationary cost increases. The reasons for the lower margin guidance are a result of short-term shocks in our ecosystem and can be adjusted over time in collaboration with our ecosystem partners. Therefore, our longer-term gross margin ambition of 54% to 56% in 2025, as communicated during Investor Day last year, is still valid. The global megatrends driving our industry are still in place and fueling demand for both advanced and mature nodes. The expanding application space for semiconductors and secular trends are driving long-term structural demand. The growth in the automotive market is strong as semiconductor content scales with increasing automation and electrification. Customers are indicating increasing demand for semiconductors as part of the green energy transition and build-out of the smart grid. The demand for more mature technology nodes is driven by the Internet of Things fueling demand for sensors, power ICs, and actuators. Customers are seeing very strong growth due to demand from high-performance computing applications. As applications require higher performance at a lower power, we see the energy-efficient path to transistor growth driving the need for larger die sizes. Finally, there are a number of fabs being planned or already in progress driven primarily by technological sovereignty investments and subsidy schemes next to increased foundry competition. Growth in semiconductor end markets and increasing lithography intensity are pushing the demand for our products and services. This is evident in our quarterly order flow of over \u20ac6 billion the past five quarters and a record order intake of \u20ac8.5 billion this past quarter. Our backlog has grown to over \u20ac33 billion and we expect continued high order intake this quarter. Almost 85% of this backlog is for EUV and immersion which is planned for advanced nodes. Demand for our products this year and next continues to exceed supply. There is clear concern in the market regarding recessionary fears and the impact this could have on demand. If we were to go into a significant recession, we would not be immune to this, but we don't expect our 2022 business to be impacted. For 2023, given our backlog, we believe that we are well covered. Customers keep stressing that they will not cut CapEx for litho despite current market conditions and uncertainties. Assuming that we have the supply chain issues addressed by the end of the year, or early next year, we remain optimistic about turning the envisaged capacity for 2023 of more than 60 EUV systems and more than 375 deep UV systems into another healthy growth year for ASML. We are actively engaging with our supply chain to add capacity so that we will be able to have a shipment capacity in 2025 of around 90 EUV 0.33 NA systems and around 600 deep UV systems. Our 2025 capacity targets and updates to our longer-term scenarios will be addressed at our Investor Day later this year. In summary, although we are currently experiencing obvious supply chain challenges, we are still working to maximize output to meet the strong customer demand through fast shipments. We expect demand to exceed supply this year and next. Even though there are currently clear macroeconomic concerns, we expect strong continued demand for semiconductors in support of the ongoing digital transformation. We are working to increase our capacity next year and further increase this by 2025. We remain confident in the opportunity this provides for our future growth, which we plan to update you during our Investor Day on November 11th.",

          "content": "Thank you, Peter, and welcome everyone. I will first review the third quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the fourth quarter of 2022. Net sales came in at \u20ac5.8 billion, above our guidance, due to faster completion of installations, triggering earlier revenue recognition, a release of deferred income on a factory option which has now been accepted at customer sites, as well as higher installed base business. We shipped 13 EUV systems and recognized \u20ac2.2 billion revenue from 12 systems this quarter. Net system sales were \u20ac4.3 billion, which was again driven by Logic at 68% and the remaining 32% from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.5 billion, above guidance, due to higher upgrade revenue. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.8%, which is above our guidance, primarily due to the pull-in of revenue from both the release of deferred income on a factory option as well as additional upgrade business. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at \u20ac819 million and SG&A expenses of \u20ac236 million as guided. Net income in Q3 was \u20ac1.7 billion, representing 29.4% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac4.29. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at a level of \u20ac3.4 billion. Moving to the order book, Q3 net systems bookings came in at a record \u20ac8.9 billion, reflecting the continued strong customer demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Strong order intake of \u20ac3.8 billion for EUV systems, including NA, as well as \u20ac5.1 billion for non-EUV systems, which include DTV and metrology and inspection systems. Total net systems bookings were driven by Logic, with 77% of bookings and Memory accounting for the remaining 23%. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of '22. We expect Q4 total net sales to be between \u20ac6.1 billion and \u20ac6.6 billion. This excludes around \u20ac100 million of net delay revenue for Q4, as a result of more expected fast shipments at the end of Q4 and the end of Q3. We expect our Q4 installed base management sales to be around \u20ac1.6 billion. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be around 49%. The improved margin effect of higher volume relative to Q3 is more than offset by negative margin effects primarily from DTV mix, pulling of revenue recognition on higher-margin factory options from Q4 into Q3, and inflation costs hitting us this quarter. This translates to an expected gross margin approaching 50% for the full year. The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around \u20ac880 million and SG&A is expected to be around \u20ac265 million. The higher R&D guidance is primarily due to additional headcount and labor cost increases. Higher SG&A is mainly due to additional headcount and IT spending. There are also some small negative foreign exchange effects on both R&D and SG&A. Our estimated 2022 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be around 15%. In Q3, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share. The second quarterly interim dividend will be \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share and will be payable on November 14, 2022. In Q3, 2022 we repurchased around 2.1 million shares for a total amount of around \u20ac1 billion. We have now completed our 2021-2023 share buyback program. On November 11, 2022, we will hold our Investor Day where we will provide an update on our long-term business plan, including a new share buyback program. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Peter.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, revenue and profitability for the quarter came in above guidance. We expect sales in the fourth quarter to be higher, as we continue to work through supply chain issues and reduce cycle times. Relative to last quarter, we now expect stronger revenue growth for the year, with full year 2022 sales of \u20ac21.1 billion, using the midpoint of the Q4 guidance. This includes a higher EUV system revenue of around \u20ac6.8 billion, as well as higher rates of base revenue. Due to fast shipments, we also expect delayed revenue of around \u20ac2.2 billion into 2023. The total business volume for 2022 is basically unchanged from the start of the year. Looking at the current market environment, there's clearly a lot of uncertainty due to a number of global macro concerns regarding inflation, consumer confidence, and the real chance of a recession. As we have shown in the past, in such an environment, we need to maintain flexibility in our supply chain, our workforce, and our manufacturing capability. You would also expect an impact on customer confidence around their CapEx spending. In fact, we do see some customers running at lower tool utilization levels and revising their CapEx plans for next year. While some customers are adjusting the desired timing of their demand, the vast majority of our customers is still requesting shipments of the litho systems as soon as possible. This is clearly driven by the strategic nature of these investments in support of technology transitions and capacity additions, which require time for wafer output to materialize, as well as governments' global investments in pursuit of technology sovereignty. Our 2023 shipment demand is still significantly above our build and shipment capacity for next year, supported by the record bookings this quarter of \u20ac8.9 billion and our largest backlog ever of over \u20ac38 billion. Almost 85% of this backlog is for EUV and immersion, which is used for advanced nodes and related wafer capacity expansions. Regarding our supply chain, we need to continue managing risks, but over the past quarter, we have seen an improvement in the predictability of the move rates in the supply chain. As a result, we now foresee a further improvement in our output capability in Q4. Moving to net sales in the quarter and deferred revenue from fast shipments, you see an increase in shipment value over the year starting with \u20ac4.9 billion in Q1, \u20ac5.7 billion in Q2, then \u20ac6 billion in Q3, and we expect around \u20ac6.4 billion in Q4. Building on this progress, we feel we are well-positioned to further increase our capacity next year. Looking to next year and bearing in mind the current environment, it's too early to provide specific guidance. With demand expected to remain significantly above supply, and based on discussions with our customers, we're planning to increase our system output next year, assuming we address the supply chain issues in the coming quarter. We're planning to ship over 60 EUV systems and over 375 DPV systems in 2023, with around 25% of the DPV systems being emerging. Regarding gross margin, as Roger mentioned, we expect to approach 50% this year. As discussed last quarter, we are in discussions with customers to share the extraordinary inflationary costs from freight, labor, as well as system components. These discussions are progressing, and in general, customers understand our request to share this extraordinary cost increase. We expect to receive a reasonable level of inflation compensation over the course of next year. Assuming successful progress on this item, based on current macroeconomic conditions and inflation levels, and considering that next year, we will likely have less gross margin impact from fast shipments than in 2022, we expect gross margin to improve next year. We will continue to make the required investments as we need to ramp our capacity in anticipation of leading to long-term growth in our industry. These investments might put some pressure on our gross margin next year, but are essential if we want to maintain the longer-term growth profile of the company. That said, we see clear gradual progress from today towards our longer-term gross margin ambition of 54% to 56% by 2025. Longer term, the expanding application space for semiconductors and secular trends are driving structural demand, and this is why we're actively adding capacity and planning to further increase our EUV and DPV shipments in future years to meet customer demand. As announced earlier today, we welcome a new member to the Board of Management, our strategic sourcing and procurement officer, underscoring the significance of working with our supply chain to drive future capacity growth. Regarding our capacity for 2025 and beyond, we're actively working with our supply chain to achieve the earlier communicated targets of 90 units for 0.33 of low NA EUV and 600 units for DPV, along with a medium-term target of high NA EUV. Next month, at our Investor Day on November 11, we will provide updates on how we see changes in the end market growth driving increased demand for our litho systems, the implications for our capacity plans, and longer-term financial scenarios for 2025 and 2030. Finally, regarding the announcement from the US government around export control restrictions, we have performed our initial assessment and expect the direct impact on ASML's overall shipment plan for 2023 to be limited. However, there could be an indirect impact due to the inability of other equipment suppliers to shift their systems. Our current expectation of such an indirect impact will be around 5% of our backlog. This percentage is based on the share of our backlog of purchase orders from Chinese fabs that, in our current assessment, meet the technology criteria outlined in the updated US export control restrictions. We will continue to refine our assessments as the situation evolves. While ASML is fully committed to comply with all applicable regulations, the new regulations do not directly change US export controls on our equipment. As a European-based company with limited US technology in our systems, ASML can continue to ship all non-EUV lithography shipments to China from the Netherlands. Additionally, we can ship most US-origin spare parts to most customers in China working on mature nodes without needing a US export license. The new export control rules predominantly affect advanced nodes, and our business in China primarily targets mature nodes. Lastly, if for export control-related reasons we cannot ship to more advanced fabs in China, we have more than enough demand for these systems elsewhere globally, as demand continues to exceed supply. In summary, while the current environment presents a lot of uncertainty due to macro concerns, our customers' demand for our products continues to exceed supply. We are working to increase our capacity next year, planning to further boost this by 2025, as previously communicated, because we remain fully confident in the opportunities this provides for our future growth. We plan to provide updates during our Investor Day on November 11, and we certainly hope to see you there. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.",

If we assume that more than 40% maybe 50% of deep UV revenues is from Memory, can you help us reconcile your guidance and what your customers are seeing, for example, with maybe the wafer fab equipment Memory CapEx down more than 40% into next year? Just trying to think about the litho intensity excluding EUV.

          "content": "Yes, Xavier, thank you. When you look at the backlog of \u20ac38 billion, about one-fourth of this is Memory and about 75% is for our Logic customers. That backlog is based on what our customers are currently thinking about their lithography investments for 2023 capacity additions, which you need to remember is not only for mainstream capacity but also for advanced technology nodes. Having said that, some of our customers, and that would not exclude Memory customers, have indeed looked at their CapEx guidance for next year and taken it down. But those same customers tell us they need those machines, and these are the machines that they need for 2023 because they are strategic and long-term in nature. If you ship in 2023, it will only be for 2024 output due to the long lead time and character of our systems. These are strategic tools, and we have stated that we never look at WFE as an indicator because it is a lagging indicator. Customers will do what they need to do. We really focus on discussions with our customers regarding their strategic roadmap and the expansion of capacity, and that drives our current order intake. I fully understand that it could mean that in a particular year, there might be anomalies in litho intensity numbers due to various reasons as we transition from downturns to upturns and vice versa. However, we prioritize the long-term investment profile of our customers and maintain close contact with them, indicating the validity of their orders even in a challenging environment.",

Yes, that could be a potential outcome, but I think it's too early to tell right now.

It includes consumer, industrial, automotive, and energy transition markets. The sheer application space has grown tremendously. The number of mask sets used in Logic from 20-nanometer upward to 28, 45, 65, and 90-nanometer has remained stable over the last 12 years, except for the past two years. Recently, there's been a significant increase in the number of mask sets, up to 30% to 40%, which indicates a growth in deep UV technology applications.

Wouldn't it be logical to assume that as we look towards 2023, there should be no reason why this steps up again, but above \u20ac0.1 billion? In other words, the \u20ac2.2 billion that's getting deferred into 2023, would it be fair to assume a significantly smaller portion might go out from 2023? Can we potentially use the \u20ac6.4 billion that you're doing in Q4 as a good basis for quarterly run rate as we look towards 2023?",

So, that's the normalization effect we should see. We're having discussions on whether we can recognize revenue differently upon shipment. As soon as we see potential changes in that regard, we will let you know. However, under the assumption that nothing changes, 2023 should more or less neutralize for the effect of fast shipments.",

You've got this \u20ac2.2 billion that is deferred into next year. For what I remember you said that you will have the capacity to do 60 EUV tools next year. If you consider that along with a higher capacity of deep UV next year, the revenue you can generate if all that is recognized next year is quite much higher than where consensus is looking for you for 2023. So maybe you can help us understand the puts and takes. Do you mean that the \u20ac2.2 billion that we enter 2023 will still be remaining in the pre-shipments, or is there a risk of pushing again into 2024?

With that in mind, I have two specific clarification questions on the things we've discussed a lot on the call today. The first one is regarding 2023, considering the Memory sector.

We shipped 18 EUV systems and recognized \u20ac2.3 billion in revenue from 13 systems this quarter. Net system sales of \u20ac4.7 billion, which was again driven by Logic at 64%, with the remaining 36% coming from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.7 billion, which was higher than guided due to additional upgrade revenue. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.5%, which is above our guidance, primarily due to the pull-in of additional upgrade business as well as an insurance settlement from the ASML Berlin fire, which occurred in early 2022. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at \u20ac906 million, above our guidance due to higher depreciation. SG&A expenses were \u20ac280 million, higher than guided due to increased IT and recruiting spending as part of our headcount growth plan. Net income in Q4 was \u20ac1.8 billion, representing 28.2% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac4.60. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at a level of \u20ac7.4 billion. Moving to the order book, Q4 net system bookings came in at \u20ac6.3 billion, which is made up of \u20ac3.4 billion for EUV bookings and \u20ac2.9 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections. Non-EUV bookings are a combination of deep UV and metrology and inspection. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 66% of the bookings, while Memory accounted for the remaining 34%. Looking at the full year, net sales grew 14% to \u20ac21.2 billion. EUV system sales grew 12% to \u20ac7 billion realized from 40 systems, while in total, we shipped 54 EUV systems in 2022. Deep UV system sales grew 13% to \u20ac7.7 billion. Our metrology and inspection system sales grew 28% to \u20ac660 million. Looking at the market segments for 2022, Logic system revenue was \u20ac10 billion, which is a 4% increase from last year. Memory system revenue was \u20ac5.5 billion, which is a 34% increase from last year. Installed Base Management sales were \u20ac5.7 billion, which is a 16% increase compared to the previous year. At the end of 2022, we finished with a backlog of \u20ac40.4 billion, an increase of 67% compared to the end of 2021. Our R&D spending increased to \u20ac3.3 billion in 2022, as we continue to invest in innovation across our full product portfolio. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2022 sales were about 15%. SG&A increased to \u20ac946 million in 2022, which was about 4% of sales. Net income for the full year was \u20ac5.6 billion, 26.6% of net sales, resulting in an EPS of \u20ac14.14. Improvements in working capital contributed to a free cash flow generation of \u20ac7.2 billion for 2022, mainly driven by customer down payments following the very significant order intake this year. We continue to invest in support of our roadmap and planned capacity ramp. Excess cash will be returned to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2023. We expect Q1 net sales to be between \u20ac6.1 billion and \u20ac6.5 billion. Per customer requests, we prioritized resources towards the acceleration of deep UV shipments at the end of 2022. As a result, we expect lower revenue in Q1 and higher revenue in the following quarters. We expect our Q1 Installed Base Management sales to be around \u20ac1.5 billion. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 49% and 50%. The lower margin relative to last quarter is primarily due to lower upgrade revenue and deep UV mix effect. The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around \u20ac965 million, and SG&A is expected to be around \u20ac285 million. The higher R&D guidance is primarily due to additional headcount and labor cost increases. These investments are in support of our continuous innovation as we further expand our deep UV, EUV, and applications roadmap and, at the same time, work to improve our installed base performance. Higher SG&A is mainly due to additional headcount and IT spending. Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. In Q4, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share. The third quarterly interim dividend will be \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share and will be made payable on February 15, 2023. Recognizing this interim dividend and the two interim dividends of \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share paid in 2022, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of \u20ac1.69 per ordinary share. In Q4 2022, we purchased around 0.6 million shares for a total amount of around \u20ac300 million. ASML announced a new share buyback program during our Investor Day on November 11, 2022, to be executed by December 31, 2025. We intend to purchase shares up to an amount of \u20ac12 billion. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Peter.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had a year of record sales in a dynamic environment. Demand remains strong, and we finished the year with a record backlog. Looking to 2023, there continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the market due to several global macro concerns around inflation, rising interest rates, recession, and the geopolitical environment, including export controls. Customers are still seeing demand weakness in consumer-driven end markets, most notably with PCs and smartphones, with some indication of softening or lower growth rates in data center demand. Meanwhile, the demand strength continues in other markets such as automotive and industrial. Customers are telling us they expect a rebalancing of semiconductor inventories over the first half of 2023, with business expected to rebound in the second half of the year. A potential driver of this recovery in the second half of the year could also be the post-COVID opening of China. This could have a positive effect on both supply and demand. To help rebalance inventory levels, customers are running their lithography systems at lower utilization levels, and some have lowered their CapEx plans for this year. Based on this, we concluded that most of our customers have made the assessment that the duration of a potential recession is significantly shorter than our average delivery lead time. Additionally, lithography investments are strategic in nature, which means that the demand for our systems remains strong. For instance, this year, demand still exceeds our capacity, and we enter the year with a backlog of \u20ac40.4 billion, so our focus will still be on maximizing system output. We've experienced several quarters of very strong bookings, which now provides backlog coverage significantly beyond 2023, which is almost twice the expected 2023 system sales. Based on discussions with our customers and continued improvements in the capability of our supply chain, we are planning to increase our output capability this year. We are planning to ship around 60 EUV systems and around 375 deep UV systems in 2023, with around 25% of the deep UV systems to be immersion. We still plan a significant number of fast shipments this year, which, under the current way of working, will result in a similar amount of delayed revenue out of 2023 that came into 2023. Looking at the growth of the business for the full year 2023 compared to 2022, we expect EUV revenue growth of around 40% and non-EUV revenue growth of around 30%. For the Installed Base Management business, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of around 5%. As we are coming off a strong growth year in 2022 and customers are adjusting their utilization levels, we currently expect to see a slightly lower demand in our upgrade business in 2023. In summary, for the full year 2023, based on how we see the world today, we expect another year of strong growth with a net sales increase of over 25% and a slight improvement in gross margin. On the geopolitical front, relating to export control, this continues to be a geopolitical discussion with different government entities, a process where ASML is not in control; however, we continue the discussion with governments to ensure that the consequences of proposals are well understood. As of today, export control policy related to lithography equipment has not changed. We are still not able to ship EUV systems to China but are able to ship deep UV, as well as metrology and inspection systems to China. As our Prime Minister recently stated, this is a multinational discussion, not only with the U.S. but with several countries. He reiterated that multiple companies in the semiconductor industry, including their supply chains, are involved, and that the matter is complex and sensitive. It needs careful handling with precision. He reminded us that there is a lot of interest at stake, and it's important to find the right balance. Therefore, we will not speculate about the possible outcome; we will have to wait for the outcome of ongoing government discussions. Looking longer term, we talked at our Investor Day last year about the global megatrends, where the broadening application space is fueling demand for advanced and mature nodes. Secular growth drivers in semiconductor end markets and increasing lithography intensity on future technology nodes are driving the demand for our products and services. ASML and its supply chain partners are actively adding capacity to meet future customer demand as confirmed at Investor Day, with our capacity plans of 600 deep UV, 90 EUV low-NA systems by 2025-'26 and 20 EUV high-NA systems by '27-'28. Also presented during our Investor Day last November, we see an opportunity based on different market scenarios to reach an annual revenue in 2025 between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac40 billion and in 2030, an annual revenue between \u20ac44 billion and \u20ac60 billion. Part of our long-term growth opportunity, we also remain committed to our ambitious ESG sustainability goals. On February 15, 2023, our 2022 annual report will be published. As part of this report, we plan to provide you with an update on how we collaborate with our stakeholders to deliver on the ambitions of our ESG Sustainability strategy, which we can summarize as follows: Our ambition is to achieve carbon neutrality with net-zero emissions in our operations, Scope 1 and 2 by 2025; we aim to achieve net-zero emissions in our supply chain, Scope 3, by 2030; and net-zero emissions from the use of our products by our customers, Scope 3, by 2040. In addition, our goal is to have zero waste from operations to landfill and incineration by 2030. Socially, our ambition is to ensure that responsible growth benefits everyone. To maintain our fast pace of innovation and ensure our long-term success as a company, we need to attract and retain the best talent and provide the best possible employee experience. We aim to be a valued and trusted partner, improving the quality of life for all people in our communities. In summary, while there is a lot of near-term uncertainty in the current environment, our customers' demand for our products continues to exceed supply. We're working to increase our capacity to meet our customers' future demand, and we're fully confident in the opportunity this provides for our future growth. With that, we would be happy to take your questions.",

Looking at recent order intake, Memory appears to be doing well, with an increase in the quarter and healthy performance for the year. This suggests that Memory buyers are making strategic investments in anticipation of a market recovery, which is reflected in the order intake. However, considering the dynamics I've mentioned, we felt it was not useful to provide guidance for the full year on this.",

So this is just a matter of discussions with customers about a fair distribution of the burden. We're fairly advanced in that discussion. A number of customers have already made commitments to us on how they're going to contribute, with most other customers who are fairly advanced and we think that we're going to find a solution. Only a minority of customers are not open to this conversation. The lion's share is open to the conversation. But it is really in the spirit of finding a fair distribution of the inflation burden. So that has helped. We're only putting into the backlog those inflation adjustments that have been explicitly agreed with customers. More of that is to come because, as I said, we have a number of customers who are still in negotiations. In terms of quantifying it, last year, we said we were having about a 1.5% drag on the gross margin coming from inflation. I would say most of that we expect to recover during the year. Thus, most of the inflation we incurred over 2022, we will recover. But of course, there will be inflation in 2023, which will remain a drag on the gross margin. So the gross margin impact of inflation will be less than it was last year, but in comparison to 2021, you will still see a bit of a drag on the gross margin.",

Last year, we kept informing you that the demand significantly exceeded our build capacity, and while that demand did come down, the cumulative demand is still higher than what we can produce. Average expectations on the duration of the inventory downturn are significantly shorter than our lead times. This gives us good visibility into 2024. We have over \u20ac40 billion in the backlog, which is almost double the system sales we expect to fulfill this year.

          "content": "Thank you, Peter; and welcome, everyone. I will first review the first quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2023. Let me start with our first quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at \u20ac6.7 billion, which was above our guidance due to higher than expected EUV and Deep UV revenue from faster installation and earlier acceptance of systems in the quarter. We shipped 9 EUV systems and recognized \u20ac2.9 billion revenue from 17 systems this quarter. Net system sales were at \u20ac5.3 billion, which was again driven by logic at 70% with the remaining 30% coming from memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.4 billion, which was lower than guided due to less upgrade revenue. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 50.6%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by additional EUV and Deep UV immersion revenue in the quarter, which more than outweighed the impact of lower-than-expected upgrade business. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at \u20ac948 million, which was below our guidance, primarily due to exchange rate effects and some one-offs. SG&A expenses were \u20ac260 million, also lower-than-guided, primarily due to lower IT spending and timing of headcount additions. Net income in Q1 was \u20ac2 billion, representing 29% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac4.96. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of \u20ac6.7 billion. Moving to the order book, Q1 net system bookings came in at \u20ac3.8 billion, which is made up of \u20ac1.6 billion for EUV bookings and \u20ac2.2 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by logic with 79% of the bookings, while memory accounted for the remaining 21%. Bookings are lower than in previous quarters, which is not unexpected given the current environment, particularly taking into account our backlog at the end of Q1 of around \u20ac39 billion, which is almost 2x this year's system sales. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2023. We expect Q2 net sales to be between \u20ac6.5 billion and \u20ac7 billion. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management sales to be around \u20ac1.3 billion. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around \u20ac990 million, and SG&A is expected to be around \u20ac275 million. The higher R&D guidance is primarily due to investments in support of our continuous innovation as we further extend our product roadmaps and improve our installed base performance. Higher SG&A is mainly due to additional headcount and associated infrastructure support. Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. In Q1, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share. Recognizing the three interim dividends of \u20ac1.37 per ordinary share each paid in 2022 and 2023, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the General Meeting of \u20ac1.69 per ordinary share. This will result in a total dividend for the year 2022 of \u20ac5.80 per ordinary share, which is a 5.5% increase compared to 2021. In Q1 2023, we purchased around 0.7 million shares for a total amount of around \u20ac400 million. In the current uncertain market environment, it is prudent that we continue to manage higher levels of cash as the entire value chain will likely create some pressure on our free cash flow. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",

          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had a good first quarter above our guidance in a very dynamic environment and there continues to be a lot of uncertainty in the market due to a number of global macro concerns around inflation, rising interest rates, recession and the geopolitical environment, including export controls. Customers continue to see demand weakness in consumer-driven end markets, causing the industry to actively reduce inventory and lower the utilization of their production base, while demand in other end markets, such as automotive and industrial, remains relatively strong. Specifically, memory customers are more aggressively lowering CapEx and are limiting wafer output to reduce inventory to more healthy levels. Logic customers are also moderating wafer output for some market segments, while demand continues to be strong in other markets, especially in markets requiring more mature nodes. Despite this, both logic and memory customers are still following their technology roadmaps and continue making strategic technology investments. As a result of this market dynamic, we do see customers making adjustments to demand timing relative to last quarter. However, we also see other customers more than willing to absorb this demand change, particularly in Deep UV. For example, domestic customers focusing on mid-critical and mature applications, which make up over 20% of our backlog at the end of Q1, are now expected to grow to a similar allocation of our system revenue this year. After taking these demand adjustments over the quarter into account, our system demand still exceeds our capacity for this year, albeit by a smaller margin than in the last quarter and as a reference, during 2022, the demand for Deep UV was 50% higher than our build capacity, while this gradually reduced from 30% at the end of Q4 2022 to 20% at the end of Q1 2023. As Roger mentioned, we saw orders moderate in Q1 after several quarters of very strong bookings. A moderation in the rate at which customers are adding orders is to be expected in the current environment, especially considering the long period in which our backlog can cover shipments, which extends well beyond our normal order lead times. With regard to our total system capacity, we are still planning to ship around 60 EUV systems and around 375 Deep UV systems in 2023, with around 25% of the Deep UV systems being immersion. We currently see no change in our full year outlook as provided last quarter. As a reminder, we expect EUV business growth to be around 40% over 2022 and non-EUV business growth of around 30%. For the Installed Base business, we still expect year-over-year revenue growth of around 5%. And, in summary, based on our view today, we continue to expect a year of strong growth with a net sales increase of over 25% and a slight improvement in gross margin. To summarize, our short to medium term business outlook is still very strong, supported by a backlog that represents almost two years of tool shipments continuously pushing our output capacity to the maximum and further underpinning our plan to expand our capacity. On the geopolitical front, as it relates to export controls, we're still waiting for the Dutch government to publish further details on the export control restrictions. These new export controls focus on advanced chip manufacturing technology. Due to these upcoming regulations, ASML will need to apply for export licenses for shipments of the most advanced immersion Deep UV systems. And, as we've said earlier, we interpret most advanced to pertain to TWINSCAN NXT controls to be translated into legislation and take effect. Based on the announcement last month, our expectation of the Dutch government's licensing policy, the current market developments and the way we model our longer-term scenarios, we do not expect a material effect on our 2023 financial outlook, or on our longer-term scenarios as announced during our Investor Day in November last year. And despite the clear shorter-term cyclical concerns, the longer-term global megatrends we talked about at the Investor Day are broadening the application space and fueling demand for advanced and mature nodes. Secular growth drivers in semiconductor end markets and increasing lithography intensity on the future technology nodes are driving demand for our products and services. In summary, while there is clear uncertainty in the current environment, our customers' demand for our products continues to exceed supply. We had a good start to the year and based on our view today, we continue to expect another year of strong growth. ASML and its supply chain partners continue to work on the capacity ramp in support of our customers' demand and we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity.

Looking ahead to 2024, we see an increased demand for tool shipments and sales compared to 2023. A large portion of this demand is already booked, although some orders for the latter half of next year still need to be secured. I am confident that these will materialize within this year. While there are uncertainties like inflation, interest rates, and geopolitical issues, we do not anticipate a drastic recession. Our customers are managing the current conditions by carefully reducing inventory and adjusting their utilization rates while preparing for next year's demand, as they are investing in new fabs that require our tools. Though not all orders for 2024 are confirmed yet, our discussions indicate a clear rise in the number of tools needed, driven by technology transitions and our customers' commitment to managing their inventory in a stable macroeconomic environment. This gives us confidence that 2024 will see growth compared to 2023. While I can't specify an exact date for when these orders will come in, I firmly believe they will.

First, we anticipate a significant increase in EUV productivity throughout the remainder of this decade. Second, the introduction of High-NA will contribute to this growth as well. We're observing more EUV layers in chip designs, not fewer, indicating an upward trend in EUV intensity. This insight is grounded in extensive discussions with our customers' R&D teams and serves as the foundation for our Capital Markets presentation from last year, which remains applicable today.

Clearly, your strong backlog is supporting your revenues for 2023, and you've indicated it's significantly more than one full year of revenue. However, as net orders are weakening, how should we interpret the trend in EUV demand for 2024 with the backlog normalizing? Do you still anticipate that EUV shipments will increase in 2024, especially considering your visibility for the next two years regarding EUV? I'm just trying to understand your comments about the delays in relation to EUV demand for 2024 given the long visibility.",

          "content": "Yes. When we discuss a demand pushout, it's important to note that we have previously mentioned that demand significantly exceeds our production capacity. Therefore, we can address demand pushouts without impacting our production capacity, since our capacity is below the demand level. Currently, some of the demand that was expected in 2023 has shifted to 2024. Looking ahead to 2024, we anticipate an increase in our shipments, which is applicable both to our company overall and specifically to EUV. I have already provided reasons for this in response to the first question. This is particularly true for Deep UV as well. We experienced significant over-demand in 2022, and while it has decreased slightly in 2023, the situation remains similar. Demand fluctuations do not necessarily lead to changes in output because our production capacity is considerably limited. This is something to keep in mind. We also consider customer demand based on their expansion plans and their projected production capacity for the following year, which is influenced by their assessment of the current downturn's duration. However, customers currently expect to manage their inventory levels diligently and have reduced utilization to balance supply and demand in the chip sector. This approach suggests a short-term scenario rather than a long-term one, which implies that they are maintaining their 2024 demand levels with us as initially planned. Some of it still needs to be booked, particularly for the latter half of next year. We do need to secure those orders, but I am confident that we will do so, and we are planning for higher unit numbers for both Deep UV and EUV.",

The demand for these semiconductors is substantial. In conversations I've had with a Chinese end customer in the product manufacturing sector, specifically in electric vehicles, it's evident that the production of electric vehicles will require multiple 28 and 45-nanometer fabs, which are currently not available. This need is crucial. Many people underestimate the significant demand in the mid-critical and mature semiconductor markets. This demand will continue to grow, whether in automotive, energy transition, or industrial applications, and will include the sensors needed for AI systems. The mid-critical and mature semiconductor sector plays a vital role here, especially given China's strength in this area. Consequently, it's likely that this could account for 40% to 50% of our Deep UV backlog.",

You've mentioned some moderation there, could you provide insights on any changes in discussions with customers? You mentioned they are sticking to their tech roadmaps, but is this consistent across all customers or are there variations? I'd like to understand if there have been any notable changes in the logic end market. My second question pertains to capital allocation. I noticed in the annual report that you indicated your CapEx for this year might be \u20ac2.4 billion, which suggests a level of capital intensity higher than in the past, particularly the highest in the last 10 to 15 years that I can recall. Could you clarify if this is due to one-off factors? How should we view capital intensity and broader capital allocation for this year and beyond? Thank you.",

Regarding the first question about changes in the logic end markets and their roadmaps, I would say the advanced roadmaps are largely stable. The three roadmaps for the three, two, and sub-2 nanometer technologies are clearly outlined. Only three players are actively pursuing this, and I don't expect those roadmaps to shift. The main feedback from our customers in that area is for us to maintain our commitment to delivering the next generation to align with their introduction schedules. I don't see significant changes there. However, I do notice shifts in the mid-critical and mature systems. In these areas, customers are transitioning from mature to mid-critical levels, and from low-mid-critical to high-mid-critical, indicating a noticeable acceleration in roadmaps. This trend is more apparent in the mature and mid-critical sectors than in the advanced sector. The transition to EUV technology necessitates a significant boost in 20, 28, and 45 nanometer capabilities, presenting substantial opportunities. Consequently, we see the most substantial changes occurring within the logic segment.",

The main components of that figure include two key aspects: the preparations for High-NA and the ongoing efforts to increase our capacity to 90 and 600. For High-NA, part of this includes the prototypes we are developing, which will eventually be introduced to the market. As a result, there will be some reversal at a later stage, contributing to the relatively high figure we're seeing this year. Additionally, substantial construction work is happening worldwide to support the capacity expansion we've discussed. Looking at the longer term through 2025, it is reasonable to expect capital expenditures in the range of \u20ac1.5 billion to \u20ac2 billion, as these will be the years we continue building the capacity previously mentioned.",

And, secondly, a question we've received from investors is just on average selling prices, you obviously talked about some weakening semi fundamentals, which you've characterized as being shorter term in nature, but just curious to what degree that could limit your ability to increase the ASPs and offset some of those cost pressures you've talked about in recent quarters?

While software upgrades are easier, any extended downtime on a machine during a growth period is problematic for customers, and they want to avoid that. You're absolutely correct. In a downturn, however, we do see the opposite effect, as utilization decreases. At the start of such a downturn, customer budgets for upgrades will also decrease. This is why we anticipate an upside in the second half of the year; we believe it's a shorter-term downturn. Toward the year's end, we expect to see signs of recovery, and customers will begin to extend their plans. We will encourage them to proceed with upgrades, even if they aren't at 100% utilization yet, because it\u2019s likely they will reach it in one or two quarters. This is when we will emphasize the necessity of upgrades, and that represents an opportunity for us. If our customers can manage through the current inventory issues and notice the upcoming upturn with rising utilization rates, that\u2019s the moment they will seek upgrades, and we will be there to remind them.

So, we're still in discussions with someone we hope to be able to conclude those discussions actually in this quarter. So, by the end of Q2, we should be in a position to give you what the overall picture is, but I'm very helpful that the larger customers that we have are willing to share in the burden of inflation, which I think from a fairness perspective is the right thing to do.

          "content": "Yes, I believe that has always been the case. Customers will utilize the tools for the nodes where they need them, so it really depends on the size of the node. If the 3 nanometer or 5 nanometer node is either small or large, that will influence the demand for EUV tools. Customers, being business entities, will allocate their capital based on their assessments. The key factor is the size of those nodes. From our discussions with customers, it seems they perceive the 3 nanometer node as significant. Any shortfall in the 5 nanometer tools can be compensated by using the machines in the 3 nanometer node. Ultimately, the node size drives the need for EUV tools, and this aligns with the current customer demand we are observing. This also answers the questions I received earlier today. We still expect overall demand for EUV and Deep UV to rise next year, reflecting our customers' beliefs about their required capacity, which is determined by their expectations for node sizes and the end demand from their customers. Regarding your first question about pushing and pulling, that's particularly relevant for Deep UV, but not as much for EUV. In the Deep UV space, especially in memory, we've witnessed that while 3D NAND doesn\u2019t utilize EUV, the market conditions are not optimal. Therefore, we are seeing some pushbacks, but these tools will still be accepted by IDMs and our customers in regions like China. So, the pushing and pulling dynamics are primarily a Deep UV concern.",

During my recent trip to China, I engaged with numerous customers and end users who discussed their expansion plans. This is particularly relevant in areas like the EUV transition, the deployment of communication networks, and the energy transition, which are all in the mid-critical to mature stage. The volume of end products they intend to manufacture is substantial, but the semiconductor capacity needed to support this growth is still under construction. This supports my belief in its sustainability. I think we might be underestimating the demand for mature and mid-critical semiconductors. Their application is extensive, and while I may sound repetitive, my recent interactions with customers have reinforced my conviction that this demand is real. The expansion plans in key Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen indicate that the necessary manufacturing facilities will be established. The markets are ready, and there will be significant production aimed at serving the domestic Chinese market. So, in summary, I view this demand as sustainable, based on my recent observations.",

The 5% we mentioned in the previous call was related to the indirect impact of the October 7 rule, which allowed us to ship lithography tools to China. It's important to differentiate between the October 7 U.S. regulations and the new trilateral Dutch export control rules. We interpret advanced immersion technology, designated as NXT:2XXX, under the Dutch regulations, not the October 7 rules. We could ship all Deep UV immersion tools to China unless restrictions were applied to deposition and etch technologies, which could have indirectly impacted us, accounting for that 5%. Currently, most Chinese customers have adjusted their plans away from anything that falls under the October 7 U.S. regulations to avoid being impeded. They are reverting back to 20 nanometer processes and above, which is a very significant market. The demand for that product in the Chinese domestic market is substantial. As a result, they are not ordering the 2050s or 2100s but are going back to the 1980s. So, I think the 5% impact is not relevant anymore. The situation is now governed by the potential Dutch rules, which allows for the 1980 model to remain unaffected by export controls as we see them today. This means that the market is still open, and there's considerable demand for it.",

Ultimately, what influences demand is our customers' confidence in 2024 and 2025. They require that capacity. As I mentioned before, we're not anticipating a significant recession; instead, it's more of a typical downturn situation for the semiconductor industry, which we haven't seen in several years. Currently, supply exceeds demand, and we understand the factors influencing demand\u2014high inflation rates, reduced consumer confidence, and geopolitical uncertainties. These are contributing to lower end demand than initially expected. We find ourselves in a classic semiconductor downcycle, with customers diligently managing their output to achieve a balance in supply and demand, which is when we can expect a turnaround. The main question is the pace and angle of that recovery. While I can't predict it, I can say that no one is predicting a severe recession. We also observe that decreasing inflation rates might boost consumer confidence, and growth rates in China seem to be better than anticipated. All these factors could positively influence demand in 2024. We need to navigate through a couple more quarters like we are today, possibly extending for another one or two quarters. However, looking at ASML, our backlog, and longer lead times, this is not a major concern for us. We expect to see growth next year, and nothing I observe today raises significant alarms about our trajectory. I am confident that we will experience growth.",

And I think that is going to be indeed something that we're going to discuss with our customers and that's an expression of their confidence that they need those machines by the time.

          "content": "Thank you, Peter, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2023. Let me start with our second quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at \u20ac6.9 billion, which is at the high end of our guidance. We shipped 13 EUV systems and recognized \u20ac2 billion revenue from 12 systems this quarter. Net system sales of \u20ac5.6 billion, which was mainly driven by Logic at 84%, with the remaining 16% coming from Memory. The net sales value of our fast shipments not yet recognized in revenue in the first half of 2023 amounts to \u20ac1.4 billion. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.3 billion as guided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.3%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by additional DUV immersion revenue in the quarter, partly related to starting revenue recognition upon shipment for immersion systems that are fast-shipped. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at \u20ac1 billion and SG&A expenses came in at \u20ac281 million, both basically as guided. Net income in Q2 was \u20ac1.9 billion, representing 28.1% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac4.93. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of \u20ac6.3 billion. Moving to the order book, Q2 net system bookings came in at \u20ac4.5 billion, which is made up of \u20ac1.6 billion for EUV bookings and \u20ac2.9 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation correction. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 69% of the bookings while Memory accounted for the remaining 31%. At the end of Q2, we have around \u20ac38 billion in our backlog. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2023. We expect Q3 net sales to be between \u20ac6.5 billion and \u20ac7 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base Management sales to be around \u20ac1.4 billion. Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be around 50%, a little below last quarter due to deep UV mix. The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around \u20ac1 billion, and SG&A is expected to be around \u20ac285 million. Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. An interim dividend of \u20ac1.45 per ordinary share will be made payable in August 10, 2023. In Q2 2023, we purchased around 0.8 million shares for a total amount of around \u20ac500 million. As mentioned last quarter, in the current environment, we expect to see ongoing pressure on our free cash flow. As a result, we will be prudent in managing our cash flows and maintaining relatively higher levels of cash. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",

          "speaker": "Peter Wennink",
          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger mentioned, we delivered another solid quarter in a dynamic environment. There is still significant uncertainty in the market due to various global macro concerns such as inflation, rising interest rates, recession, and geopolitical factors, including export controls. Some end markets appear to be hitting the bottom of the cycle, but the semiconductor industry is facing high inventory levels, prompting customers to reduce wafer output as they work on balancing their inventories. To limit wafer output, customers are operating at lower litho tool utilization rates and are cautious because of the unpredictability surrounding the timing, shape, and slope of recovery. We experienced an increase in bookings this quarter, leading to a backlog of about \u20ac38 billion at the end of the second quarter. In our EUV business, there have been changes in demand timing primarily due to fab readiness issues and uncertainty around recovery. Demand for deep UV remains higher than supply. Although some customers have delayed deep UV demand, strong demand for tools at mature and mid-critical nodes, especially in China, has helped balance this out. Our Chinese customers have had a demand fill rate of less than 50% over the past two years, so they are seizing the opportunity to receive and install systems in their fabs as tool availability improves.  In our deep UV segment, we plan to ship more than 375 systems, with over 25% being immersion systems. For these immersion systems, we have reached an agreement with customers to simplify the acceptance test procedure, allowing for revenue recognition upon shipment. This adjustment means we anticipate an additional revenue of around \u20ac700 million in 2023, reducing the amount of revenue that will be delayed to 2024 from approximately \u20ac3 billion to about \u20ac2.3 billion. This incremental revenue from deep UV increases the expected year-over-year growth of our non-EUV business from around 30% last quarter to about 50%. In the EUV segment, due to adjustments by customers regarding demand timing linked to fab readiness delays and ongoing supply chain issues, we now expect to ship around 52 systems this year, leading to a year-over-year revenue growth of about 25% compared to our earlier expectation of roughly 40%.  Regarding our Installed Base business, given the current utilization rates and market uncertainties, customers are postponing productivity and performance upgrades on their litho systems. As a result, we now expect our Installed Base business this year to remain similar to last year instead of growing by around 5% as previously anticipated. Overall, based on our current outlook, with increased deep UV revenue somewhat offset by lower expectations for our EUV and Installed Base businesses compared to last quarter, we now expect net sales growth for the year to trend towards 30%, up from our earlier estimate of over 25%. We still expect a slight improvement in gross margin relative to 2022, consistent with our previous guidance, as the positive impact from increased deep UV immersion revenue is expected to be offset by lower upgrade revenue in 2023.  Concerning geopolitical matters related to export control, the final Dutch regulations published recently align with our earlier expectations. These regulations require ASML to apply for export licenses with the Dutch government for all shipments of its most advanced immersion deep UV lithography systems. It's important to note that EUV tool sales have already been restricted, and our business in China is primarily focused on mature and mid-critical nodes. The new Dutch export regulations will be effective starting September 1, 2023. Recent media reports have suggested additional U.S. export controls, but we cannot respond to speculation. Based on our current understanding, we do not foresee a change in our outlook. Therefore, we do not anticipate that the Dutch regulations or any potential U.S. measures will significantly impact our financial outlook for 2023 or our long-term scenarios discussed during our Investor Day last November.  Looking ahead to next year, our customers across various market segments are increasingly cautious due to ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties. Previously, customers anticipated a recovery in the latter half of this year, but now it seems more likely to be pushed into 2024, with the specifics of the recovery still unclear. However, given the current strong demand and a substantial backlog of around \u20ac38 billion, there are still growth opportunities available in 2024. Yet, due to existing uncertainties, it's premature to provide concrete forecasts for next year. We will continue to monitor market developments and provide updates in the upcoming quarters. Despite the short-term uncertainty, the long-term trends we discussed at our Investor Day are expanding the application space and driving demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Growth factors in semiconductor end markets like electrification and AI, along with increasing lithography intensity for future technology nodes, continue to drive demand for our offerings. In summary, while the current macro environment presents notable uncertainty, we are navigating a strong backlog and expect growth this year approaching 30%. In the near to medium term, customers are cautious as they adjust wafer output to lower inventory levels across the supply chain and seek to gain confidence in the recovery's timing and progress. ASML and our supply chain partners remain focused on enhancing capacity to meet future customer demand, and we maintain confidence in our long-term growth prospects. With that, we welcome your questions.",

It's important to note that our entire order book for 2024 isn't completely secured by purchase orders yet, so we still need those orders to come in. The demand we see for 2024 is closely linked to the outlook for 2025, which points to the launch and initial ramp-up of major advanced fabs in the Logic sector, including 2-nanometer and 3-nanometer fabs for leading customers. This contributes to the firm demand we are currently experiencing, suggesting we have significant growth opportunities in 2024. Still, we must acknowledge uncertainties related to macroeconomic conditions, particularly regarding the pace of recovery. Analysts and customers believe we may experience the bottom of this downcycle sometime this year, followed by a recovery. However, the nature of that recovery will be impacted by macroeconomic uncertainty, including whether fabs will increase capacity in 2024. There's a heightened level of uncertainty regarding which fabs will take on more machines in order to ramp up for 2025 as planned. Although our order book and demand appear strong, we prefer to wait for these conditions to translate into orders over the next few quarters.

If we decrease capacity, we might struggle to ship in 2025, considering that our lead times in the supply chain range from 12 to 18 months. Therefore, at this moment, we don't see any reason to change our capacity plans for 2024, as our outlook for 2025 influences this decision.

Capacity increases occur in step functions rather than gradually. To reach 600 units by 2025 or 2026, we need to integrate that step capacity into the supply chain by the end of 2024 and throughout 2025. The decision to place all orders depends on demand. However, our plans for 2025 and 2026 will set us up for the rest of the decade, as we remain confident in our long-term outlook for this market.

So, obviously, quite some of the bookings for EUV, that are currently coming in are also for the 3800. The 3800s, we promise you that on this call we would disclose the ASP and the ASP is at least north of \u20ac200 million. So that is a clear indication I think of how that indeed will also help in terms of revenue. It will also help in terms of gross margin ultimately because even though it's a more expensive machine to make, because bear in mind, there are commonalities. There is quite some commonality in parts between high-NA tool and the 3800 tool. It's a more expensive tool to make, but it's also a very healthy uptick in terms of ASP. So it will help both on the revenue side and also on the gross margin side starting in '24, but definitely in '25 when the lion's share of the tools there will be 3800s.",

The growth drivers for 2025 in terms of the gross margin, that's a number that I think are significant there. We just talked about one important one and that's the 3800. Of course, that's an important driver of gross margin improvement, definitely also in 2025. So that's one. The second one that I think is important in comparison to today, as you know, we are preparing both for capacity expansion on deep UV and low-NA, but we're also preparing significantly and putting a lot of money into getting everything ready for high-NA, both the manufacturing capacity here, we're building up teams in the field etc. That currently is a significant drag on our gross margin as we have it today, because all of the costs that we're incurring to prepare for that capacity ramp and for preparing for high-NA everywhere in the entire organization go straight to the gross margin today. That effect should be gone by 2025, because at that point in time, you would hope that you're actually going to be in a position to utilize at least a significant part of that incremental capacity that you built. And also by that time, you would see meaningful numbers of high-NA. So those are really important drivers of gross margin. And the only other one that I probably would give you is that is on the service side. As you know, we see a continued improvement of the EUV service margin in particular, but also in deep UV. And on both, we are driving to get the service margin up, both as a result of what we're doing on the revenue side, but also in terms of trying to further control the cost. So those are the main drivers why, looking at 2025, we believe the scenarios that we gave you there, the 54% to 56% is a tenable and reasonable aspiration for us to have.",

On average, where does utilization stand now? This will be a key factor in determining when customers might become more optimistic about placing orders in the coming quarters. Additionally, regarding China, it is clearly a significant factor in your sales this year. When we look at utilized revenue and consider the supply chain data, especially from logic companies in China, utilization appears to be just as bad, if not worse, than what we're seeing in other sectors. I\u2019m interested in understanding how sustainable these orders from China might be for next year, given that the end markets in China seem to be extremely weak right now.",

While some may argue that it's reaching a bottom, we don't identify a significant turning point. In Logic, it's still early, but we may be observing early signs of an inflection point today, though this is based on a short timeframe, so its sustainability remains to be seen. If you consider this, you might conclude that it is bottoming out, and it could be said that we've passed a turning point, although it is still too soon to tell. Regarding China, the sustainability of this situation is indeed a concern. The utilization trends in China mirror those observed worldwide. However, it is essential to understand that demand in China consists of two components. Firstly, there is the need to meet current demand, which we acknowledge is weak. The more critical aspect involves strategic investments, as factories are being developed for specific purposes. China's focus is primarily on mid-critical and mature semiconductors, which align with significant global trends. These trends include electrification in mobility, energy transitions, industrial IoT, telecommunications infrastructure development, and battery technology. China is at the forefront of these megatrends. Consequently, the Chinese semiconductor industry needs these specific semiconductors. In discussions with our Chinese clients, many expressed concern that due to rising geopolitical tensions, they prefer not to rely solely on domestic suppliers. Therefore, they plan to significantly increase their capacity for mid-critical to mature semiconductors to support these megatrends in which China excels. When we consider the overall market and the growing anxiety stemming from geopolitical issues, it becomes apparent that there is a strong motivation to build new fabs domestically. Many companies are emerging, committed to supplying these semiconductors necessary for the megatrends China is leading. This trend reflects not so much the current economic situation affecting demand but rather a strategic need, driven by the Chinese industry's dependency on imports. I believe this demand is sustainable for the coming years.",

And that is true, both within the portfolio of KrF of dry tools and also in wet tools. So, you're absolutely right, I mean, the new models that we're introducing, of course, give significant value to the customer and therefore command a significantly higher price than all the models.

In the first half, we had \u20ac2.7 billion and flat would mean that we're going to have \u20ac3 billion in the second half. So that would point at a recovery. And given the guidance that we've given for Q3, Q3 we indicated \u20ac1.4 billion, so it doesn't take a lot of compute power to calculate that, that would mean \u20ac1.6 million for Q4.

They are willing to take on the risk associated with the immersion tools upon shipment, and they prefer a shorter testing program for EUV. However, we have not reached that point yet. The question for next year will focus on the volume of fast shipments for EUV compared to standard shipments. This is the key question about EUV. The potential for tailwind in this regard will depend heavily on our plans for regular versus fast shipments. There are two factors to consider for next year. First, with the introduction of new technology, we typically want to conduct more extensive testing. The 3800 is a major advancement in our EUV offerings, so for certain tools, we will conduct more thorough testing and therefore will not fast ship them initially. We will proceed with regular shipments and complete the entire testing program. Second, it will also depend on the utilization of our capacity. Fast shipment allows us to deliver tools to customers sooner, but it also serves to optimize our capacity. These two factors will determine the type of shipments we make next year, which in turn will indicate whether we can expect any tailwind for EUV revenue.",

          "content": "Good question. We need to recognize the situation. The main reason for the delay is related to the readiness of the fabrication facilities, largely due to the availability of skilled construction workers. It may seem straightforward to hire a few workers and build a facility, but constructing a $20 billion fab for advanced processes like 5, 3, or 2 nanometers requires specialized skills. This expertise has been developed over decades, primarily in a few locations, notably Taiwan and Korea, with some presence in China. While we are still constructing these fabs in Korea, Taiwan, and other regions, including the U.S., the challenge lies in accessing the skilled labor necessary to keep construction on schedule, which is what our customers are indicating as the primary issue. Consequently, delays of a few months or a quarter are understandable. We need these advanced fabs ready by 2025, and it will take about 18 months to address the skills gaps. However, it's also possible that construction industry difficulties might recur towards the end of next year, depending on how fast they can train workers. This explains the changes in timing for demand, although there have also been a few supply chain issues this year affecting specific systems. Overall, the key reason behind the timing changes is fab readiness. I'm hopeful that the industry will quickly resolve these skill shortages, so by the end of 2024, we won\u2019t face these issues.",

This leads to a substantial demand for a wide range of mid-critical to mature semiconductors. Consequently, we see many semiconductor customers now focusing on various segments of the industry, whether it's memory, logic, or foundry.

The precision of the tool is crucial, as highlighted by the Dutch regulation, which focuses on technical specifications rather than specific types.

          "content": "Thank you, Peter, and welcome everyone. I will first review the third quarter financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the fourth quarter of 2023. Let me start with our third quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at EUR6.7 billion, which is around the midpoint of our guidance. We shipped 10 EUV systems and recognized EUR1.9 billion in revenue from 11 systems this quarter. Net system sales of EUR5.3 billion, which was mainly driven by Logic at 76% with the remaining 24% coming from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at EUR1.4 billion, as guided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.9%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by DUV product mix as well as some one-off cost effects. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at EUR992 million and SG&A expenses came in at EUR288 million, both basically as guided. Net income in Q3 was EUR1.9 billion, representing 28.4% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR4.81. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at a level of EUR5 billion. Moving to the order book, Q3 net system bookings came in at EUR2.6 billion, which is made up of EUR0.5 billion for EUV bookings and EUR2.1 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 80% of the bookings, while Memory accounted for the remaining 20%. As expected, we did see some moderation in orders this quarter. As the industry is working through a cycle, customers remain cautious in the current environment, managing cash flows and delaying purchase orders. In addition, there were no High-NA orders this quarter. While our bookings were lower than in previous quarters, our backlog at the end of Q3 remained strong at over EUR35 billion. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2023. We expect Q4 net sales to be between EUR6.7 billion and EUR7.1 billion. We expect our Q4 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR1.4 billion. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The positive impact of higher sales volume is more than offset by the dilutive impact from a change in DUV mix and one-off effects relative to last quarter. The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around EUR1.03 billion and SG&A is expected to be around EUR285 million. Our estimated 2023 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 15% and 16%. An interim dividend of EUR1.45 per ordinary share will be made payable on November 10th, 2023. In Q3 2023, we purchased shares for a total amount of around EUR100 million. As mentioned in previous quarters, in the current environment, we expect to see ongoing pressure on our free cash flow. As a result, we will be prudent in managing our cash flows and maintain relatively high levels of cash. With that I would like to turn the call over to Peter.",

        {
          "speaker": "Peter Wennink",
          "title": "CEO",
          "content": "Thank you, Roger. And I have a bit of a cold, so apologies. As Roger has highlighted, another good quarter, especially considering the current market environment. Uncertainty remains in the market, driven by global macro concerns around inflation, rising interest rates, lower GDP growth in certain economies and the geopolitical environment, including export controls. However, the industry seems to be passing through the cycle trough. There has been some improvement in end market inventory levels downstream. Although inventory levels upstream remain elevated. As a result, our customers continue to moderate wafer output by running at lower utilization levels. While lithography tool utilization is still running at levels lower than normal relative to last quarter, tool utilization in Logic continues to show signs of improvement, while Memory has yet to turn. We concur with our customers that still expect to see an inflection point, indicating the start of a recovery by the end of the year, although the shape and slope of the recovery remains uncertain. Looking further ahead to 2025, we expect a significant growth year since more than 50% of our EUV and DUV shipments will go to new fab projects. On top of this, we expect existing fabs will be adding capacity, driven by continued recovery cycle. Turning to our business, we now expect DUV revenue to grow towards 55% year-over-year, an increase from around 50% communicated last quarter, primarily driven by an increase in immersion revenue. China demand for DUV systems continues to be strong, a trend we talked about in previous quarters. For system shipments this year to Chinese customers, the majority of the orders were booked in 2022. The demand fill rate for our Chinese customers over the last two years was significantly less than 50%. So the Chinese customers were in fact receiving a much lower number of systems than they ordered. This was due to the fact that demand for our systems worldwide significantly exceeded supply. With current shifts in demand timing from other customers, we now have the opportunity to fulfill these orders to our Chinese customers. So supply is in fact catching up to demand, and we're shipping lithography systems for mature and mid-critical nodes to China, while of course complying with export control regulations. If you combine this with the fact that other customers are delaying their demand, this means indeed a higher sales percentage from China than we saw in previous years. In EUV for 2023, we continue to expect year-over-year revenue growth for EUV of around 25%, as communicated last quarter. For the Installed Base business in 2023, the current utilization rates, market uncertainty, particularly as it relates to the timing of the recovery, has led customers to continue to wait to perform productivity and performance upgrades on the litho systems. Therefore, we now expect our Installed Base business this year to be down around 5% from last year versus the flat growth previously communicated. In summary, based on our full year with higher DUV revenue offset somewhat by lower expectations on our Installed Base business relative to last quarter, we still expect net sales for the year to grow towards 30% with a slight improvement in gross margin compared to 2022. Overall, a very strong growth year, especially considering the industry being in a down-cycle. On the geopolitical front, as it relates to export controls, the US government published updated export control regulations. Part of the regulations is an update from last year's October communication and part is the implementation of the US regulation on the trilateral agreement between the Dutch, Japanese, and US governments. Given the length of the document, we need to review the final regulation thoroughly and make a detailed analysis, which will take some time. But based on our preliminary assessment, we do not expect these measures to have a material effect on our financial outlook for 2023. The export control measures could have an impact on the regional split of our shipments in the medium to long term, but we do not expect an impact on the global demand scenarios, as communicated during our Investor Day in November last year, since the long-term growth perspectives for our industry remain clearly unchanged. Looking towards next year, the semiconductor industry is currently working through the bottom of the cycle and our customers expect the inflection to be visible by the end of this year, as I mentioned before. Although there is an opportunity for some demand to be pulled back into the back half of 2024, we currently prefer to take a more conservative view for the full-year 2024, especially considering the inherent nature of the macroeconomic uncertainties. Therefore, based on our current view, we expect the revenue next year to be similar to 2023. As such, we see 2024 as a transition year, but also as an important year to prepare for the significant growth that we expect in 2025. Now, based on discussions with our customers, we currently expect 2025 to be a strong year, driven by a number of factors. First, the secular growth drivers in the semiconductor end markets, which we have previously discussed, such as energy transition, electrification, and AI. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes drives demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Secondly, the industry expects to be in the middle of a cyclical upturn in 2025, starting in 2024. Lastly, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for the significant number of new fabs that are being built across the globe. These fabs are spread geographically, are strategic for our customers, and are scheduled to take our tools. It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity to be ready for this ramp. In summary, despite going through an industry downcycle, we still expect very strong growth in our business this year, and while there are still significant uncertainties primarily driven by the macro environment, it appears that we're passing through the bottom of this specific cycle, and the shape of the recovery will ultimately determine the demand curve beyond 2023. In the near term, it's understandable that customers remain cautious as they moderate wafer output to help lower inventory levels in the supply chain and look to build confidence around the timing and slope of the recovery next year. In summary, we clearly view 2024 as a transition year as we prepare for future growth and expect a strong year in 2025 and beyond. We remain confident that we are well positioned for further long-term growth, as we discussed in the market scenarios for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November 2022. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.",

The 3800\u2019s average selling price is certainly significant, as it will play a crucial role in our EUV mix next year, especially with its higher ASP. We discussed generating more than EUR200 million last quarter from this, which will contribute positively to the gross margin. Additionally, we're making progress in EUV services, which is another positive factor.  On the flip side, as you noted, we anticipate challenges for next year as we gear up for a substantial year in 2025. As Peter mentioned in our video, we're preparing to significantly expand our capacity, which will temporarily impact gross margin due to the necessary training for new hires in 2024; they will mainly be productive in 2025. Similarly, while the revenue and output from High-NA will be minimal next year, we are training our workforce to support the ramp-up in 2025 and beyond, which will also affect the gross margin negatively in 2024.  There's also uncertainty surrounding our Installed Base business, which could positively or negatively influence the gross margin depending on the recovery of the upgrade business in 2024. Lastly, considering the various factors at play, including what Peter mentioned about China export controls, we might see a reduction in immersion tools sent to China, especially high-end models, which could also pose a challenge for gross margin. Overall, Joe, these are the factors I see today, and we should have clearer insights by our Q4 call in January next year.",

The orders were prepaid and we had the chance to deliver, but I don\u2019t expect that level of volume to repeat next year. Additionally, new export control regulations will affect some Chinese fabs, restricting our ability to ship immersion tools. While this is only a small number of fabs, it will impact sales we experienced in 2023 that we won\u2019t see in 2024. Therefore, we might see a decrease in DUV sales. If sales remain stable or similar while EUV grows, as Roger pointed out, we anticipate that rapid shipments in 2024 will be lower. This situation will likely create an accounting impact on our top line. Overall, we might see lower DUV unit sales, and while EUV units could also decline, we might still see revenue growth due to increased sales prices. This is the outlook for next year. As Roger mentioned, the January update after the fourth quarter results will provide more detailed information, but this is the general direction you can expect.",

Most of our shipments to China are focused on mid-critical to mature applications, which is the core of our business. There are a few fabs that have been identified as prepared for advanced semiconductor manufacturing, but these are exceptions. Generally, I don't expect this segment to level off. The reason for my outlook is the substantial demand for chips driven by China's investments, which exceed 50% of global funding in renewable energy, including wind and solar, as well as grid electrification and electric vehicle manufacturing. Additionally, the industrial Internet of Things and the ongoing expansion of telecommunications infrastructure are also significant contributors. With a population of 1.4 billion, China's semiconductor requirements are considerable. When we analyze the expansion strategies of our Chinese clients, we observe that they are concentrating their resources on these areas. In fact, China's semiconductor consumption outpaces its oil imports. Considering the rapid advancements in technology, China still faces a considerable gap to achieve self-sufficiency. As a result, it's understandable that they are investing in semiconductor technology for domestic needs. I anticipate that there won't be a peak in demand this year or the next, and moving forward, there will likely be significant demand from China for mid-critical and mature technology for the reasons I've outlined.",

Regarding Memory, we have not yet observed an upturn, so we need to monitor this closely to see when it will occur. Typically, an increase in Logic leads to a corresponding rise in Memory, as Logic without Memory doesn\u2019t work effectively. This likely comes down to timing, and we\u2019ll keep a close watch on it. Additionally, some recent articles from Korea indicated that NAND shipments have actually increased for the first time in a year, and we\u2019re seeing initial signs of rising DRAM spot prices.

I mean, it would still imply a significant recovery in 2025, but I just wanted to check if it's fair to assume given the current utilization rate in the industry and the pushout that you are also seeing on your side, if we should lean towards the low end of your guidance.

          "content": "Let me explain. Our industry is cyclical, and during a downturn, the more significant the downturn, the more substantial the upturn tends to be. This is due to the underlying need for capacity to support the ongoing trends we all recognize. Various factors can contribute to these downturns, such as macroeconomic issues. The cyclical nature of our industry over the past 30 years supports this observation.  In my earlier remarks, I outlined three reasons we believe 2025 will be a strong year. First, these underlying trends indicate that we will need to build capacity to support them. If we don\u2019t invest in this capacity during 2023 and 2024, which in the case of Memory actually started in mid-2022, we won\u2019t be prepared to meet the upcoming demand. Second, based on feedback from our customers, it seems we are either at the bottom of the cycle or very close to it, suggesting growth will start in 2024. While there may be debates about how quickly that growth will come due to macroeconomic uncertainties, customers are signaling to prepare for a growth trajectory into 2025.  Third, when we consider the number of new factories being built or expanded globally, particularly in Europe, the US, and Asia, more than half of our expected demand for 2025 comes from these new fabs. Given our lead times\u2014over 12 months for most tools, with EUV taking even longer\u2014we need to maintain close communication with our customers and understand their expansion plans.  With all these factors in mind, the discussions we have had with customers suggest that 2025 will be a robust year, which is inconsistent with the lower end of our guidance. For instance, if 2024 doesn\u2019t fully recover, the Memory segment could be facing a downturn for an extended period, which historically has always been followed by significant recovery. The same applies to Logic.  Considering these three critical points gives us confidence that 2025 will be strong. However, we must prepare during 2024, as we cannot wait until early 2025 to mobilize our resources due to long supply chain lead times. Thus, we need to view 2024 and 2025 together, as our discussions with customers indicate this is essential for our planning. Apologies for the lengthy response.",

The demand was quite solid in these areas. The shift in demand seemed to occur more in leading-edge markets rather than in mature sectors. It's important to note that leading edge also requires mature technology, like KrF and i-line, in addition to advanced DUV and immersion. If we break this down, the demand shift was likely more prominent in markets such as smartphones and PCs, where we\u2019ve seen inventory issues. Consequently, this is where demand fluctuations have occurred. However, the mature markets remained relatively healthy, particularly in China, where we had under-delivered to our customers.

As you indicated, the way we understand the regulations now is that the principle is that tools from the 1980s are subject to export control restrictions, but only when they are used for advanced semiconductor manufacturing. This advanced semiconductor manufacturing is only applicable to a limited number of fabs. Therefore, the 1980 tools are restricted for those specific fabs, but not for the majority of our Chinese customers, for whom we do not require an export control license and can ship freely. These shipments are for mature and lower mid-critical chips necessary for the transitions I just mentioned.",

When I look at the leading edge, we've had a couple of years of a slow start to three nanometer. As a matter of fact, the leading edge has been trending in a half pitch, and I was hoping that by next year, there will be a bigger demand for leading edge among Foundry and your Logic customer, but what I get from you is probably EUV unit shipment is going to decline. What I want to ask you or get a clarification is this a kind of a pause as we insert a gate-all-around? Is this something that happened when we went from planar to FinFET and we're going to see the repeat of that next year and then that would impact your EUV shipment? Any thought around gate-all-around would be appreciated.",

The expected pause or reduced unit shipments of EUV next year is a consequence of the cyclical downturn we are experiencing, where certain end markets do not require full capacity. The R&D roadmaps remain solid, and our key customers continue to affirm this. Therefore, while we anticipate a high-volume manufacturing ramp for the gate-all-around architecture, it contributes to my optimism for 2025 and 2026 being successful years. What's happening currently is unrelated to our roadmaps; it purely reflects the current downcycle we're in, and as we progress out of it, capacity utilization at the leading edge is not at full capacity. It's a matter of growing into that capacity as part of this cycle.",

You might have seen that on the hiring of people, we slowed down a little bit this year. So part of that is in response to what I've just mentioned on SG&A. It's also in response to the fact that in 2022, we hired 10,000 people. So on the 42,000 people that we have today, that's massive. So obviously you want a certain level of absorption to happen there, and that's exactly what we're doing, making sure that people are well absorbed, that the growth also on the R&D headcount is nicely absorbed. So that's why you see this slowing down a little bit on hiring, hiring people, but no, I mean, we continue to push down the accelerator on the R&D front because the opportunity is significant. And in order for us to achieve the growth trajectory that we've talked about in '25 and 2030, we simply need to do that. So, yes, we will be frugal.

You have a significant backlog of over $35 billion, including more than $19 billion on the EUV side. In light of a previous question about pushouts, do you perceive a risk when looking into 2024, particularly for your EUV segment? Is your uncertainty primarily regarding potential pushouts in the existing backlog, or is it more about the volume of orders you can secure in Q4 for shipment in 2024?

Right now, all of our customers are experiencing a downturn and believe we may be nearing a low point, or possibly witnessing some positive changes that could lead us out of this phase. Considering the customers' mindset, if they anticipate these positive changes towards the end of the year, they are likely to expect growth in 2024. Therefore, what we currently discuss with them reflects a minimum scenario, assuming that everything unfolds as we foresee with regards to these positive changes, they will experience growth. However, at this moment, they are not placing many orders; they are currently focused on their existing supplies and the essentials they require for 2024. They have indicated that we should also prepare for 2025 but see their minimum needs for 2024 as a cautious estimate. While a more optimistic scenario could suggest a turnaround in the latter half of 2024, we don't see any signs indicating that this will occur so soon. The conservative outlook they have shared with us suggests there is minimal downside risk. As for potential upside, that would imply that improvements expected in 2025 could actually materialize in the second half of 2024.

This could potentially change, but that risk has always existed regarding the expansion of export controls. This brings us back to how future geopolitical escalations will unfold, which remains uncertain. We have to operate with the current regulations, which stem from the October 7 proposal last year and a trilateral agreement involving the Netherlands, Japan, and the U.S. This has produced the current scenario with a limited number of facilities involved. It's important to note that this situation results from extensive discussions among governments rather than arbitrary decisions.

          "content": "Thank you, Peter and welcome, everyone. I will first review the fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the first quarter of 2024. Let me start with our fourth quarter accomplishments. Net sales came in at \u20ac7.2 billion, which is just above our guidance, primarily due to more installed base business. We shipped 10 EUV systems and recognized \u20ac2.3 billion revenue from 13 systems this quarter. Net system sales of \u20ac5.7 billion were primarily driven by Logic at 63%, with the remaining 37% coming from Memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in at \u20ac1.6 billion, which was higher than guided due to additional service and upgrade sales. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.4%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by installed base business. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in at \u20ac1.041 billion and SG&A expenses were reported at \u20ac284 million, both as guided. Net income in Q4 was \u20ac2 billion, representing 28.3% of net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac5.21. Turning to the balance sheet; we ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at a level of \u20ac7 billion. Moving to the order book; Q4 net system bookings came in at \u20ac9.2 billion, which consists of \u20ac5.6 billion for EUV bookings and \u20ac3.6 billion for non-EUV bookings. These values also include inflation corrections. Net system bookings in the quarter are more balanced between Logic and Memory relative to past few quarters, with Logic at 53% of the bookings, while Memory accounted for the remaining 47%. Looking at the full year, net sales grew 30% to \u20ac27.6 billion, with a gross margin of 51.3%. EUV system sales grew 30% to \u20ac9.1 billion, realized from 53 systems while, in total, we shipped 42 EUV systems in 2023. DPV system sales grew 60% to \u20ac12.3 billion. Our metrology and inspection system sales decreased 19% to \u20ac536 million. Looking at the market segments for 2023; Logic system revenue was \u20ac16 billion, which is a 60% increase from last year. Memory system revenue was \u20ac6 billion, which is a 9% increase from last year. Installed base management sales was \u20ac5.6 billion, which is a 2% decrease compared to the previous year. At the end of 2023, we finished with a backlog of \u20ac39 billion. Our R&D spending increased to \u20ac4 billion in 2023 as we continue to invest in innovation across our full product portfolio. Overall, R&D investments as a percentage of 2023 sales were about 14%. SG&A increased to \u20ac1.1 billion in 2023, which was about 4% of sales. Net income for the full year was \u20ac7.8 billion, representing 28.4% of net sales, resulting in an EPS of \u20ac19.91. We finished 2023 with a free cash flow generation of \u20ac3.2 billion. We returned \u20ac3.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in 2023. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2024. We expect Q1 net sales to be between \u20ac5 billion and \u20ac5.5 billion. We expect our Q1 installed base management sales to be around \u20ac1.3 billion. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 48% and 49%. Lower revenue and margin relative to Q4 is primarily driven by lower emerging volume, along with an unfavorable change in product mix. In addition, we also expect EUV volume and lower installed base business in Q1 relative to Q4. The relatively slow start to the year is a reflection of the current state of the industry coming out of a downturn. As it relates to gross margin, I would like to make a few more comments on the 2024 margin drivers as well as our longer-term ambitions of 54% to 56% by 2025. We finished 2023 with a full year gross margin of 51.3% and there are a number of developments that could impact the gross margin in 2024. For EUV, positive drivers include a higher ASP of the 3800E as well as improving EUV service margins. For DPV, we expect product mix to have a negative impact on margin in 2024. On our installed base business, we currently expect a similar gross margin as 2023 but the final impact will ultimately depend on the level of upgrades in 2024. And finally, as we have said before, we expect significant costs in 2024 related to the introduction of High-NA and to the ramp of our capacity to 90 EUV, 600 DPV levels that we have talked about before which will create pressure on the gross margin. When we assess the combined effects of these different developments, we expect a slightly lower gross margin in 2024 compared to 2023. We are still targeting our earlier communicated gross margin ambition of 54% to 56% by 2025. This increase in gross margin will be driven by a number of items. First, higher sales volume, both in EUV and DPV which improved fixed cost coverage. Second, a move to a higher-margin EUV 0.33 NA system as the vast majority of systems in 2025 are planned to be 3,800 E-Systems. Third, we expect reduced headwinds from capacity investments as we ramp volume, including High NA. Fourth, we will also be transitioning to a higher-margin EUV high NA system, the 5200 in 2025. Lastly, we expect our installed base business to have a positive impact on 2025 margins due to both improved EUV service margins as well as increased upgrade business volume. The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around \u20ac1.07 billion and SG&A is expected to be around \u20ac300 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%. In Q4, ASML paid the second quarterly interim dividend of \u20ac1.45 per ordinary share. ASML intends to declare a total dividend for the year 2023 of \u20ac6.10 per ordinary share. The third interim dividend of \u20ac1.45 per ordinary share will be made payable on February 14, 2024. Recognizing this third interim dividend and the two interim dividends of \u20ac1.45 per ordinary share paid in 2023, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of \u20ac1.75 per ordinary share. In Q4 2023, no shares were purchased. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we had another year of very strong growth in a very challenging environment. And we finished the year with a solid backlog of \u20ac39 billion. The uncertainty remains in the market due to a number of global macro concerns, while the semiconductor industry is currently working through the bottom of the cycle. Our customers are still not certain on the shape or slope of the recovery this year but there are some positive signs in the indicators that we have been monitoring. Industry end market inventory levels continue to improve, moving towards more healthy levels. Lithography utilization levels are still running lower than normal but are now improving in both logic and memory. We expect utilization levels to continue to improve over the course of this year. And lastly, as mentioned by Roger, we saw very strong order intake in the fourth quarter in support of future demand. To be able to follow the curve of the industry recovery, we are looking at the combined demand for 2024 and 2025. As mentioned last quarter, we view 2024 as a transition year in preparation for the expected strong demand in 2025. We, therefore, continue to make investments this year, both in capacity ramp and in technology to be ready for the upturn in the cycle. While we see some positive signs of recovery, we feel it might be a bit too early to change our perhaps conservative view as communicated last quarter and therefore, still stay with our previously communicated expectation of 2024 revenue to be similar to 2023. Looking at the market segments; customers are indicating they are seeing healthy growth this year, primarily driven by AI-related demand for both Logic and Memory but also expected from other end markets as inventory levels improve. And coming off a very strong year in 2023 with 60% growth in Logic revenue, we expect some pause in demand as customers digest the capacity additions and while utilization levels improve. Based on current demand, we see lower Logic revenue in 2024 versus 2023. For Memory, inventories are approaching normal levels and customers are expecting to see demand growth on a number of end markets this year. Lithography demand is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM in support of AI-related demand. We currently see revenue growth in our 2024 memory business versus 2023. Turning to our businesses for EUV; we are expecting revenue growth in 2024 and we are planning to recognize revenue on a similar number of EUV low-NA systems as 2023 which includes the fast shipments for 2023. Although we planned a similar number of systems as 2023, we will have higher ASPs from the NXE:3800E systems, more weighted towards the second half of the year. In addition, we expect revenue from one or two high-NA sectors. Based on the aforementioned, we expect our non-EUV business to be down in 2024, primarily driven by lower immersion sales relative to 2023. For our installed base business, based on our view today, we expect a similar level of revenue compared to last year, plus the recovery becomes more clear this year. Customers may likely look to upgrade their systems in preparation for 2025. This could provide future business opportunity this year. As a reflection of the current state of the industry coming out of a downturn and an expected recovery over the course of 2024, we expect a stronger second half relative to the first half of this year. On the geopolitical front, as communicated earlier, we do not expect to get export licenses for our most advanced immersion systems, the NXE:2000 and up for China in 2024. We have been in contact with the U.S. government on their export control regulations announced in October last year, and we can confirm the estimated financial impact as communicated in October. At that time, we stated that the impact of the Dutch and the U.S. export control regulations combined is 10% to 15% of our 2023 China system revenue. This impact is based on our presumption that as of 2024, we will not obtain export licenses for NXE:2000 and up immersion systems to Chinese customers. In the case of only a handful of Chinese fabs, this also includes NXE:1970 and 1980 systems. While the export regulations had an impact on our business, we continue to see strong demand for mid-critical and mature nodes in China. Looking longer term, while there are still significant uncertainties, primarily driven by the macro environment, it appears we are passing through the bottom of this specific cycle and expect an industry recovery over the course of 2024. Based on discussions with our customers and supported by our strong backlog, we currently expect 2025 to be a strong year driven by a number of factors. First, the secular growth drivers in the semiconductor end markets which we have previously discussed, such as energy transition electrification and AI. The expanding applications, along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes, drives demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Second, the industry expects to be in the middle of a cyclical upturn in 2025. And lastly, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for a significant number of new fabs that are being built across the globe in some instances clearly supported by several government incentive plans. These steps are spread geographically, are strategic for our customers, and are scheduled to take our tools. It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for further long-term growth as we discussed in the market scenarios for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November 2022. We plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024. In summary, although there are still near-term uncertainties with a positive outlook trend, we clearly remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity. And with that, we'd be happy to take your questions.",

Historically, both for our company and the industry, this indicates that we are entering a recovery cycle, which should persist throughout the year, suggesting that 2025 may be the first full year of recovery. That said, to evaluate the pace of recovery, we are taking a somewhat conservative stance, although this could change. If the recovery progresses more quickly than anticipated, some of the business we are preparing to ship or build in 2024 could actually be shipped in that year. While I don't expect this to happen in the first half, there are key areas where we might see system shipments move into 2024. Additionally, when this occurs, customers may notice it and find time to make upgrades and take advantage of the installed base business, which typically offers higher margins. These aspects represent the main areas where we foresee potential upside for 2024.",

That will actually drive higher utilization of our tools and will mean pull in of those machines because customers don't want to miss the market upturn.

But it's also fair to see that we are in ramping mode. We are preparing for a ramp in 2025, and that means we're taking in materials. We're building inventory for High-NA, et cetera, et cetera.

I believe we could aim for the middle or high end of that range, but I won't provide specific guidance, as it may be premature to discuss 2025 outlooks at this time. Nonetheless, I feel confident that the low end is too conservative since we expect 2025 to be a robust year. The order intake supports our previous statements, and I feel more assured. If 2025 unfolds as anticipated, we should see a stronger flow of orders in 2024. Our lead time for orders is 12 to 18 months, so we need to secure orders in the first half of 2024 to support our expectations for 2025.

And Peter just gave you that impact, the 10% to 15%. So I think fundamentally, it's pretty clear that the China demand remains very strong. As we said before, it's primarily driven towards mature and met critical nodes. I mean that's what it's all for. It's a bit too early to speculate exactly how the China demand is going to pan out because that's also dependent on how the demand for the rest of the world is going to pan out because as you know, from previous years, we have allocation questions, right? So for a number of tools, we're still supply constrained. So there you have to determine where the tool is going. And that will only be known once you have a complete picture of all the demand on a global basis.

So we were very skeptical about these targets of the \u20ac500 million of EUV bookings. Now you come this quarter with indeed this huge booking number in terms of EUV which basically puts you in a much better position into 2025. And indeed, it's clearly supporting your comments 3 months ago. But I would like to know this Q4 orders, we know that it's very lumpy. It's always moving from one quarter to another very significantly. To what extent Q4 orders are a pull-in effect? In other words, do you see still a healthy EUV activity? I don't expect the \u20ac5.6 billion every quarter. I'm not saying that. But should we \u2014 do you see already in Q1, the activity of EUV fairly healthy and in Q2?

But I have to warn you that trends in EUV order intake in our business with a few customers might be a very tricky thing to do to actually try to assess it, which is actually proven by the order intake in Q3 and in Q4. It's lumpy, as you said. And it has to do with a couple of things. I mean, in Q4, also clearly, the \u2014 as part of the EUV order intake had to do with the obvious technology transitions needed in the memory space to support AI. That will continue. But I think all in all, in 2025, when we look at a recovery of these \u2014 of the cycle and have a full year recovery. On top of that, the new fabs. Yes, we need to see a healthy order intake for EUV in the first half of this year of 2024. Just like I said earlier, we have 12 to 18 months or a lead time, so that needs to happen. And I think this is what we need to see. And then, I don't think that Q4 \u2014 yes, it was exceptionally high. It was a very good order intake. But for good reasons. It's basically moving the EUV orders now into the 2025 delivery timeline, orders that we're now getting are not for 2024, they're for 2025. So that will have to continue and in my mind, will continue in the first half of 2024. So yes, it may not be \u20ac9.2 billion again in Q1 2024.

I think that's just part of it today. We are going through this cycle. We just see the utilization rates of our memory tools going up. I think EUV is always in that sense, cash. You don't buy loosely extra EUV systems in the dynamic space. That's always going to be the gating item. Now if you then come to the conclusion that you need more EUV because DDR5 and HBM is where the external demand is, then there's not much to migrate. You just need more \u2014 so \u2014 and I think that's on the back of a cyclical recovery because inventories are being consumed. So that migration, having the space to do migration or the \u2014 that \u2014 I don't see that. It might be available in the non-EUV space but in the EUV space, that is actually scarce tool which you don't have available in abundance and that tool will be the first to be fully utilized. So I don't know whether it's answering your question but it's just \u2014 but I'm just trying to think of what you meant or what the other question meant. But I think the recovery in memory is cyclical. And on top of that, I think we have the technology transition into DDR and into HVM. And that drives memory.

The question is where that 90 is going to be enough. Now we have to realize we are selling wafer capacity which is not only a function of the number of units but also a function of the productivity of those tools. Now we have a pretty aggressive road map for the productivity in terms of wafers per hour. So it's a complex question that you're asking. But actually, we need to look at this especially against the math that we're seeing for little requirements in the area of AI, whether it's HBM or whether it is logic, whether the number of units and the roadmap on productivity which gives wafers because the combination is wafer capacity, whether that is sufficient. That is a constant thing we have to look at and that's going to be something that I think is going to be very central when we do our Capital Markets Day by the end of the year. I think we're going to give you \u2014 it also gives us a bit of time to engage with our customers to really understand those requirements and translate that into units and productivity.

So it's really very dependent on the specific situation of a specific fab. I think the intentions are very clear. We don't see any delay there. We could seek operational delays that will push things back 6 months or 9 months; that could happen. But generally, those fabs are there, those steps are there in the U.S. They're in Japan. They're in Taiwan, they're in Korea, they're in China, they're in Europe. I mean we don't see any indication or any customer messaging to us that those things won't happen.

          "content": "Thank you, Peter, and welcome everyone. I will first review the first quarter 2024 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the second quarter of 2024. Let me start with our first quarter accomplishments. Total net sales came in at EUR5.3 billion at the midpoint of guidance. We shipped 12 EUV systems and recognized EUR1.8 billion revenue from 11 systems this quarter. Net system sales reached EUR4 billion, driven by logic at 63%, with the remaining 37% coming from memory. Installed base management sales for the quarter came in at EUR1.3 billion as guided. Gross margin for the quarter stood at 51%, which is above our guidance, primarily driven by product mix or immersion in UV systems. On operating expenses, R&D expenses were EUR1.32 billion and SG&A expenses came in at EUR273 million, both slightly lower than guided due to a shift in spending to later in the year. Net income in Q1 was EUR1.2 billion, representing 23.1% of total net sales and resulting in an EPS of EUR3.11. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the first quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at EUR5.4 billion, which is lower than the previous quarter. We ended Q1 with negative free cash flow, primarily driven by lower down payments and higher inventory relative to last quarter. In the current environment, as customers work to return to profitability and strengthen cash positions, we continue to provide some support for our customers. The higher inventory is a result of increased material intake, including High NA as part of planned capacity ramp in preparation for stronger demand next year. Moving to the order book, Q1 net system bookings came in at EUR3.6 billion, made up of EUR656 million for EUV bookings and EUR2.9 billion for non-EUV bookings. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by memory at 59% and logic for the remaining 41% of the bookings. There is quite a bit of speculation around order numbers, so I will make a few comments here. In the past six months, we've had orders of almost EUR13 billion, which is quite significant. As we said in the past, our order flow can be lumpy and may not be evenly distributed over the year. Although we don't guide orders, an order rate a bit over EUR4 billion per quarter for the final three quarters of the year would provide full order coverage at the end of 2024 for a 2025 sales number that would be at the midpoint of our 2022 Investor Day scenarios. At the end of Q1 2024, we finished with a backlog of around EUR38 billion. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the second quarter of 2024. We expect Q2 total net sales to be between EUR5.7 billion and EUR6.2 billion. We expect our Q2 Installed Base Management sales to be around EUR1.4 billion. The relatively low first half of the year, compared to the expected strong second half, is in line with the expected industry recovery from the downturn. Gross margin for Q2 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. The expected R&D expenses for Q2 are around EUR1.70 billion, and SG&A is expected to be around EUR295 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%. In Q1, ASML paid a quarterly interim dividend of EUR1.45 per ordinary share. Recognizing the three interim dividends of EUR1.45 per ordinary share paid in 2023 and 2024, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the annual general meeting of EUR1.75 per ordinary share, which will result in a total dividend for the year 2023 of EUR6.10 per ordinary share, which is a 5.2% increase compared to 2022. In Q1 2024, we purchased around 0.5 million shares for a total amount of around EUR400 million. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Peter.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, a relatively slow Q1 as the start to the year is consistent with our guidance and expectations coming out of the downturn. Overall semiconductor inventory levels continue to improve, trending towards more healthy levels. We also see continued improvements in lithography tool utilization at both logic and memory customers, all in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn. Looking at the market segments, we see a similar environment as communicated last quarter with demand momentum from AI-related applications. Memory demand is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM. Logic customers continue to digest the significant capacity additions made over the past year. As many of you know, next week, April 24, is the General Meeting of shareholders and my last effective working day at ASML. Although this is not a big surprise anymore, it's still a significant event for me, Martin, and our families and it has been an enormous privilege to serve the company and its many stakeholders for so long. I have thoroughly enjoyed virtually every moment of it and the many interactions I have had with many of you, including these conference calls.

          "title": "Incoming CEO",
          "content": "Thank you, Peter. First of all, thank you for the last 10 years leading ASML and making it the great company we know today. I think some of our audience have been with you for the 40-plus quarters you led as CEO, but probably not many for the nearly 100 quarterly calls over your past 25 years in ASML. I am sure everyone on the call will miss you as much as we all will at ASML. I am myself very honored and privileged to succeed Peter, and I am very much looking forward to working with all of you. As Peter mentioned, our view on the market segment for 2024 has not changed relative to what we stated last quarter. We expect memory revenue growth this year, primarily driven by technology transition in support of advanced memory technology. We see lower logic revenue this year relative to last year as customers digest litho capacity installed over the past year. Turning to our businesses. For EUV, we continue to expect revenue growth in 2024. We plan to recognize revenue on a similar number of EUV 0.33 NA systems as in 2023. In addition, we expect revenue from one to two High NA systems. On our 0.33 NA system, we shipped the first NXE:3800E this quarter for qualification at the customer. The NXE:3800E has the capability to deliver a significant increase in performance with a productivity of 220 wafers per hour, which is a 37% increase over the NXE:3600D in its final configuration. The NXE:3800E also brings imaging and overlay improvements, which will make it the future tool of choice for memory and logic advanced nodes. Those performance increases will deliver better value for our customers, including cost of ownership, and will translate into higher ASPs and improved margins for ASML. EUV customers plan to transition to the NXE:3800E this year. As a result, the majority of our low NA EUV shipments in the second half of the year will be this system. Regarding high NA or 0.55 NA EUV, we shipped our first system to a customer, and this system is currently under installation. We started to ship the second system this month, and its installation is also about to start. During the SPIE Industry Conference in February, we announced first light on our high NA system located in our joint ASML-imec High NA in Veldhoven. We have since achieved first images with a new record resolution below 10 nanometers and expect to start exposing wafers in the coming weeks. All High NA customers will use this system for early access to process development. The customer interest for our system lab is high as this system will help both our logic and memory customers prepare for High NA insertion into their roadmaps. Relative to 0.33 NA, the 0.55 NA system provides finer resolution enabling an almost 3 times increase in transistor density at a similar productivity in support of sub-2 nanometer logic and sub-10 nanometer DRAM nodes. We expect our non-EUV business to be down in 2024, primarily driven by lower emerging system sales relative to 2023. For our Installed Base business, based on our view today, we expect a similar level of revenue compared to last year. As the recovery becomes more clear this year, customers may look to upgrade their systems in preparation for 2025, which could provide future business opportunity this year. Our outlook for the full year is unchanged with similar revenue compared to 2023. In line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn, we expect a stronger second half relative to the first half of the year. We view 2024 as a transition year and continue to make investments this year both in capacity ramp and in technology, to be ready for the upturn in the cycle. Looking longer term, while there are still significant uncertainties primarily driven by the macroenvironment, it appears we are passing through the bottom of this specific cycle, and we expect an industry recovery over the course of 2024. Based on discussions with our customers and supported by our strong backlog, we expect 2025 to be a strong year driven by a number of factors as mentioned last quarter. First, the secular growth driver in semiconductor end markets, which we have previously discussed, such as energy transition, electrification, and AI. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes, drive demand for both advanced and material nodes. Second, the industry expects to be in the middle of a cyclical upturn in 2025. And lastly, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for the significant number of new fabs that are being built across the globe, in some instances clearly supported by several government incentive plans. These fabs are spread geographically, are strategic for our customers, and are scheduled to take our tool. It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for further long-term growth as we discussed in the market scenarios for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November 2022. We plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024. In summary, also there is near-term uncertainty. We remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.",

And you said that you need to hit over EUR4 billion run rate to hit the midpoint of calendar 2025. But I'm just kind of curious, there's an expectation that it should be better than the midpoint of next fiscal year. Do you really need significant EUV orders to meet those calendar 2025 outlooks? And where do you think that's going to come from mainly? Is it the foundry logic vertical? And also just along the same path, how much of your memory bookings was from China?

          "content": "And a follow up. Many questions in one question, Krish. Very well done. I'll try and answer them as best as I can. But yes, Krish, I think you're absolutely right in our conclusion that indeed order intake is very lumpy. We've been saying that for many, many years. We said it last time when the orders came in very high. We say it today when from the vantage point of some, the orders come in pretty low. If you look at the past six months combined, you're looking at EUR13 billion, which is EUR6.5 billion per quarter, which we still continue. We still believe it's pretty significant. When I talk about the EUR4 billion needed to get to the midpoint of next year, I'm indeed talking about everything, so of course, that also includes EUV. And I think, as many of you have probably recognized, if you look at the intake in the past couple of quarters and also in the past quarter, it's pretty clear that there are a few usual suspects absent in the order intake. If we look at the plans of some of our large customers, particularly in the foundry sector, it's pretty clear that in the next couple of quarters, significant orders need to come in. Part of the EUR4 billion that you should see in order to get to this midpoint indeed has to include the orders from those customers. So again, this midpoint, does that mean that now all of a sudden, we're guiding midpoint? No, we're not. We're looking at a significant uptick in 2025, but we're not saying now you need to look at the midpoint of the guidance. In terms of your questions on memory and particularly then on China, of course, we typically do not disclose the geographic distribution of our order intake. But there is a healthy part in the order intake related to China, but it's not like the order intake is distributed over the globe. So the very high concentration that you saw in the sales for Q1, you don't see that reflected in the order intake. So the order intake is more distributed geographically than what you would see in the sales for Q1.",

Do you have any comments on China's trend, please? Then I have a follow-up.",

          "speaker": "Roger Dassen",
          "title": "CFO",
          "content": "Yes, I mean, China, relatively speaking, is high, but in absolute numbers, you would recognize that China is actually lower in Q1 than it was in Q4 of last year. So because if you do the math, then China was at EUR1.9 billion in this quarter. It was at EUR2.2 billion last quarter. So from that vantage point, it's gone down a bit, but it's still strong. The reason that China is strong both in absolute terms and relative terms is also because the rest of the world, the demand is, or at least the sales and the shipments in Q1 were relatively low, which was no surprise. I think it's very much in sync with our perspective on a market that is in recovery. A market being in recovery means that customers are first driving up the utilization of their tools, which is exactly what they're doing. If the utilization comes to a certain point, then they will start to order and will require shipments. That's exactly why we've also said on the call that we believe we're going to see momentum building up in the course of this year with a much stronger second half, as Peter also just mentioned. So, in terms of trends in China, a strong first quarter for sure, but not a record quarter, but a strong quarter. We expect China to continue to be strong this year. You have to see that in relation to the rest of the world that we believe is going to recover. We've also said on previous calls and I just want to reiterate that if you look at the demand for China, the demand in China continues to be strong. That is related to the fact that the demand for mature technology continues to be strong. We said during Capital Markets Day in 2022 that we believe that every single year between 2022 and 2030, we believe 380k wafer starts and capacity need to be added to mature. If we look at what has happened last year, what has been added in terms of that both in China and in the rest of the world, it's actually below that number. So, yes, China is strong. As a result of this, China's share in the global market share will over the years become larger than it is today. Their self-sufficiency will increase in comparison to today. We believe that what China is adding today in terms of mature capacity is rational and is in line with our expectation of what capacity and mature needs to be added in order to get to what the world needs in the second half of the decade.",

We are referring to 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer. When we look for the 2 nanometer capacity, it still has to come, and I think, as you probably are aware, we expect the ramp for that technology to start sometime next year. This will be the next most probably wave of EUV order and this is also back to the comment Roger made in answer to the first question. We are going to focus on EUV and logic foundry, mostly on 2 nanometer order intake, which, as Roger said, should come in the next few months. As for the number of layers, there is no change there. We've mentioned in the past that the EUV layer for 2 nanometer is very similar to what we had on 3 nanometer. 2 nanometer is mostly a device transition. Most customers will transition to get all around, which is a quite complex move. As a result, the focus of the change is on that.

But we do that in very close interaction with customers, understanding what they need, which I think is a big distinction. On the one hand, we\u2019re having very intense interactions with customers to understand what they need. On the other hand, the PO process, which is pretty bureaucratic and formal, has a lot of governance necessary in order to get there. So that gets you to the lumpiness.

I look forward to working more with Christophe. The first question I had is a bit on the lead times. You mentioned that the buildup of inventory doesn't impact so much the lead times if I read correctly. And when you said last quarter, you mentioned that you have 12 months or more than 12 months lead time on EUV. Now, when you look at 2025 targets or ranges, you need to have like 70 more EUV tools to get to this mid to high end? According to my calculation, I have around 30 EUV tools in the backlog for next year, which means that you would need more than 40 EUV tools still to satisfy your revenues for 2025. I'm surprised by the number of EUV tools you need. With the 12-month lead times, it seems risky for your customers to wait until the last moment. Can you help clarify that?",

However, we know quite well what customers want, and they know too. It's just a matter of those two worlds coming together and then ultimately leading to a PO. Is it a dangerous game for them?

This is a huge milestone for both our customers and ASML, because this single image proved that the technology we have been developing for many years is working. The next step is for customers to come see us to get access to the tool in our lab to start exposing their own verticals. We expect this will lead to order decisions for High NA.

To collect all that data, you need sensors in various examples, whether it\u2019s in cars or medical equipment; it's about sensing, which is the domain of mainstream semiconductors. This is crucial in the amalgamation of mainstream and advanced semiconductors. You cannot distinguish growth in one against the other.

The question is really, first can you tell us, roughly speaking, of your wafer capacity deployed in the industry. How much has transitioned to EUV yet, and how much do you think that could evolve as the industry adopts EUV for DDR5 and HBM? Related to that, I think in the past you had mentioned that over the longer term, I think 2030 was the sort of timeframe, the EUV unique breakdown could be 70-30 between logic and memory or DRAM. Do you think that the layer count increase we see with HBM could drive that to maybe a 50-50 split over the course of the next five or 10 years? Thank you so much.",

What I can share is the trend we see on DRAM, where our customers are calling for an increase node on node of the number of EUV layers. We've seen this development for a few nodes. The high bandwidth memory doesn't significantly change that because the device itself is very similar. What is changing is the ratio between the array and logic, which requires larger die and therefore more wafer capacity. We see a translation in volume, but that's not related to the number of EUV layers\u2014that's more related to the number of wafers you will need to do high bandwidth memory. Again, we are working hard to understand this better with our customers, with the intention to provide you a clearer outlook in November.",

          "content": "Thank you, Christophe, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the second quarter 2024 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the third quarter of 2024. Let me start with our second quarter accomplishments. Total net sales came in at EUR6.2 billion, which is just above guidance. Net system sales of EUR4.8 billion, which is made up of EUR1.5 billion of EUV sales and EUR3.3 billion of non-EUV sales. Net system sales were driven by Logic at 54%, with the remaining 46% coming from Memory. Installed base management sales for the quarter came in at EUR1.48 billion, slightly higher than guided. Gross margin for the quarter came in at 51.5%, which was above our guidance, primarily driven by more immersion systems than planned. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in slightly above guidance at EUR1.1 billion, due to higher R&D expenses regarding metrology and inspection, while SG&A expenses came in slightly below our guidance at EUR277 million as a result of lower IT spending. Net income in Q2 was EUR1.6 billion, representing 25.3% of total net sales, resulting in an EPS of EUR4.01. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at a level of EUR5.0 billion. We ended Q2 with free cash flow of EUR386 million, which is an improvement relative to last quarter. However, as mentioned last quarter, there continues to be pressure on free cash flow as we provide some support for our customers and operate at higher inventory levels. The latter being a result of the increased material intake, including High NA as part of our planned capacity ramp in preparation for strong demand next year. We expect a gradual return to normal cash conversion levels as the industry continues to recover. Moving to the order book. Q2 net system bookings came in at EUR5.6 billion, made up of EUR2.5 billion of EUV bookings and EUR3.1 billion of non-EUV bookings. Net system bookings in the quarter were mainly driven by Logic at 73% and Memory the remaining 27% of the bookings. At the end of Q2 2024, we finished with a backlog of around EUR39 billion. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the third quarter of 2024. We expect Q3 total net sales to be between EUR6.7 billion and EUR7.3 billion. We expect our Q3 Installed Base management sales to be around EUR1.4 billion. Gross margin for Q3 is expected to be between 50% and 51%. We still expect a slightly lower gross margin for the full year 2024 compared to 2023. Although margins for the second half of the year are expected to be positively impacted by higher volume and a more favorable EUV Low NA mix. We expect this to be offset by increased High NA costs relative to the first half of the year. The expected R&D expenses for Q3 are around EUR1.1 billion and SG&A is expected to be around EUR295 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%. In Q2, ASML paid a final dividend of EUR1.75 per ordinary share. Together with the interim dividends paid in 2023 and 2024, this resulted in a total dividend for 2023 of EUR6.10 per ordinary share. The first quarterly interim dividend over 2024 will be EUR1.52 per ordinary share and will be made payable on August 7, 2024. In Q2 2024, we purchased 106,000 shares for a total amount of EUR96 million. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Christophe.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, a good quarter with sales and profitability above guidance. Although macro uncertainty remains, overall semiconductor industry levels continue to improve, trending towards healthier levels. We also see continued improvement in lithography tool utilization levels at both Logic and Memory customers, all in line with the industry's continued recovery from the downturn. Our outlook for the full year is unchanged with revenue expected to be similar to last year. We currently see strong developments in AI driving most of the industry recovery and growth ahead of other end market segments. We still expect a stronger second half relative to the first half of the year. Logic customers continue to digest the significant capacity additions made over the past year. With this digestion, we see lower revenue from Logic this year relative to last year. In Memory, demand is primarily driven by DRAM technology node transitions in support of advanced memories such as DDR5 and HBM. In support of this transition, we expect growth in revenue from Memory this year relative to 2023. For our Installed Base business, we continue to expect a similar level of revenue compared to last year. As the recovery becomes clearer this year, customers may look to upgrade their system in preparation for 2025. Turning to our businesses. We expect EUV revenue growth in 2024. We plan to recognize revenue on a similar number of EUV systems as 2023 with expected revenue from one to two High NA systems. On our Low NA EUV system, we are deploying an additional NXE:3800E system this quarter as we continue to ramp production. As customers transition to advanced nodes in both Logic and Memory, we expect the majority of shipments in the second half of the year to be NXE:3800E system. Regarding High NA, we shipped the second system this quarter, and it is currently under installation. The first system shipped to a customer is running qualification wafers. Overall, the interest is high with EUV customers now using our High NA system in the joint ASML-imec demo lab in Veldhoven for their initial development. We have already exposed wafers for multiple Logic and Memory customers and have now achieved the imaging resolution specification of 8-nanometer. High NA will enable an almost three-time increase in transistor density relative to the Low NA system. So all-in-all, we see good momentum on High NA and are progressing well against customer expectations. We expect our non-EUV business to be down in 2024, primarily driven by lower emerging system sales relative to 2023. As we have stated over the last few quarters, we view 2024 as a transition year and continue to make investments this year, both in capacity ramp and in technology, to be ready for future demand. While the slope of the industry recovery is still uncertain, based on discussions with our customers and supported by our strong backlog, we expect 2025 to be a strong year, driven by a number of factors as mentioned last quarter. First, the secular growth driver in semiconductor end markets, which we have previously discussed, such as energy transition, electrification, and AI are still very much intact. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography on future technology nodes, drives demand for both advanced and mature nodes. Second, the industry expects to be in a cyclical upturn in 2025. And last, as mentioned earlier, we need to prepare for a number of new fabs that are being built across the globe, many of which are supported by several government incentive plans. These fabs are spread geographically and are strategic for our customers. They are all scheduled to take our tools. It is essential that we keep our focus on the future and build capacity in preparation for future long-term growth, as we discussed in the market scenario for 2025 and 2030 during our Investor Day in November 2022. We plan to update our view during our Investor Day this year on November 14, 2024. In summary, although there is near-term uncertainty, we remain confident in our long-term growth opportunity. With that, we will be happy to take your questions.",

In the booking for EUV, in the EUR2.5 billion, were there any 2-nanometer orders from foundry customers that you said you should expect in Q2 or Q3? Any High NA in the mix? And based on the bookings momentum and backlog, how do you think about calendar '25 revenues? Do you think it could be towards the upper end of the EUR30 billion to EUR40 billion range? Then I had a quick follow-up.",

So I think that gives you a pretty strong indication of who the buyers are and who is in the mix. So I think it is reasonable to assume that the foundry business at 2-nanometer is in the book. So that's one. High NA is not in there. So no High NA bookings in this quarter. So everything you see there on EUV is related to Low NA. As it relates to 2025, Krish, we're very consistent in our messaging and that's what we say. We confirm what we said in November of 2022, which is we expect 2025 to be between EUR30 billion and EUR40 billion. We've also said it's not the low point of that guidance. Last quarter, we provided a bit of an understanding of what it takes to be fully booked at the beginning of 2025 for the midpoint of the range. I think you can conclude with the bookings number that we've reported that we're nicely on track. But with that, we still confirm that our expectation is between the EUR30 billion and EUR40 billion and are not going to be more specific than what we've been so far.",

I think the point Roger and I have made in the last few quarters, which is still valid, is before you look at China, I think you have to look at the opportunity we see on the mature semiconductor market. That opportunity was defined as being significant in our Capital Market Day in November 2022. We still believe it's significant. In 2023, 2024, China has been investing a large part of this market. And this is why I think our revenue on China has been high. Moving forward, we still believe that this market is needed and therefore that the capacity from China has to come from somewhere. So that's a bit the position we take on that discussion. I think we always look at the end market, at what's the need of the end market. I think we are a bit less sensitive on where that capacity may be produced.",

And as a quick follow-up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that AI is driving most of the industry's recovering growth. Are you able to decompose? What specifically is driving this for ASML? To what extent do you see litho needs being driven by high bandwidth memory, data center processing, or edge AI? Is there any area that's surprising to the upside? Many thanks.",

We expect to observe positive effects for 2025, which we anticipate will continue into 2026 for both Memory and Logic. However, it's worth noting that other segments may lag in recovery. A significant portion of our capacity for Logic and DRAM is being allocated to AI products. As the other segments recover, we expect some of that capacity will be needed there as well. Therefore, we believe 2025 will be a strong year. While the pace of recovery is uncertain, the fundamentals surrounding AI and the overall recovery appear strong from our perspective.",

I think you're typically for this customer looking at a lead time of around a year. As we've said before, I think, putting in orders at this stage is consistent with that to the extent that there is a difference in timing or ramp. Again, I think that's a question that you might want to raise on a conference call tomorrow. But I think what we see here is pretty consistent with what we've also heard from them publicly about starting this in the second half of 2025. Christophe, on DRAM?",

Of course, it's always more difficult to make forecasts on nodes or technology that are still being defined by customers, but that logic is still in place. I think you have seen also in DRAM that at this point in time, all customers are using EUV in production. I think the last customer was very public about that recently. So you see a gradual basically adoption with different speeds, maybe per customer, but I would say very much in line with what we explained already for a few years. On High NA, we also see opportunity for DRAM at the horizon of '25, '26. As I mentioned in my commentaries, we see customers very eager to test the High NA tool in our lab, exposing their own wafers to validate that High NA can provide a nice opportunity both in performance and in cost savings. So they also, same as before, we believe that '25, '26 is about the time where we could see some insertion of High NA for DRAM.",

This was also with my comment about preparing also the capacity for that. So as Roger explained, when we prepare the capacity, taking into account the lead time we have for some of our factories, some of our suppliers, of course, the capacity is there to meet the market demand, in fact, beyond 2025. So this is what we wanted to prepare for. So this is also why we are still very comfortable with the long-term view of the market, because those things are going to come. And we could expect even more government funding moving forward, because as you also see it in the news, I think there is more and more wish from everyone to really invest in this business.

This figure comes from the expedited shipments we have made, and as our intention is to cease these expedited shipments by the end of this year, it contributes positively. Furthermore, we are shipping 3,800 tools for which we will recognize revenue after site acceptance testing by the customer. We are also shipping High NA tools, with revenue recognition occurring only at the moment of site acceptance testing.

However, it's important to note that the initial shipments of the 3,800 tools will not be fully configured right away. We will gradually enhance the 3,800s to reach the full specification of 220 wafers per hour. This means that not all of the tools shipped in the second half will generate the higher average selling price, as some revenue will be deferred until the tools are upgraded. Therefore, we may not fully benefit from the strong pricing of the 3,800s in the second half, although it will certainly provide some assistance. The impact will be more pronounced in 2025, when the share of the 3,800s will increase and all tools will meet the final specifications. Additionally, we will recognize some deferred revenue in Q4 from tools shipped in 2024. When considering gross margins for the second half, this will be one factor, along with positive contributions from higher volumes in 2025 and the second half of 2024. There will be a slight negative impact from the DVP mix, as the dry component will become more significant. Furthermore, we expect to see the first revenue from High NA tools in the second half. While this is a positive sign that customers are approving the tools, the gross margin for these tools is not high. As a result, we anticipate a slight decrease in gross margin for the second half compared to the first half of the year.",

I think the short answer is the data generation help. Again, we are exposing important wafers. We told you in the past, we are happy to get that amount of backlog on High NA because our customers were showing the trust in the technology without having any data at hand. So they were basically following our, I would say, analysis or our promise that this will help them moving forward. And they have been willing to invest in R&D quite heavily and, by the way, even down payment some of those systems. So this has a huge commitment from the industry. I think the data is helping tremendously because our customers can see data. I think that can be used also for potentially their customers to have a much better discussion around High NA. So I think the dynamic is good. And I would say the discussion is getting a lot more concrete. And I think we need to give a few more months to that discussion, so that everyone, based on data this time, has a bit of a better idea of what could be done moving forward with High NA and how quickly.",

But if we were to assume that there is some sort of AI, PC, and smartphone refresh cycle pushing volumes for those combined markets to maybe a high single-digit volume growth in calendar year '25 or calendar year '26, do you think that there is enough capacity in DRAM, maybe NAND, and maybe to a lesser degree in logic to deliver that potential uplift in volumes?",

I think what we have seen with AI is a major investment from many companies in supercomputers in the ability basically to train models. What we still miss in AI, I think, is the emergence of end product. So I think today, there's not much revenue made on AI. There's just a lot of investment. What we see is that still that investment requires a lot of capacity. I think you have seen some of our customers announcing also more capacity to be built before 2028. And as I said before, if the rest of the application were to recover, what has been done so far, which is to reallocate some of the capacity to HBM, may become more difficult. So overall, I think we still expect, as the rest of the market recovers, to see a need for more capacity. And that's, I think, also true for DRAM. Now to tell you at what speed, I think, this is still a bit difficult. I think we said it a few times. I think the recovery is something we are looking at every day and there is also a lot of uncertainty. So this is why you still see us being, I would say, strong in our view of 2025, but also a bit cautious because there's still a lot of uncertainty around these opportunities.",

We have seen very big progress there. We have measured 195 wafers per hour on the tool. We expect to see the final specification being measured also in the coming weeks. We don't see any hard showstopper, so we just see some work to be done. With the customer, I think some of the delay was also a choice we made to support the demand in the previous year. So if you remember, 2022 was a year where we saw a very strong demand from all customers on EUV. And we thought this would be wise to slow down a bit the ramp to the next product to not disrupt that demand. At this point in time, the tool also is getting at the customer. We made a choice, as has been explained before, to ship it initially at lower throughput, so that the qualification could start earlier at our customer, so that they can be ready for high-volume manufacturing next year when I think this is the real expectation for this tool to run in manufacturing. So from my point of view, maybe we said that the biggest element to help you is that technology-wise, there is no concern at all. And when it comes to qualification with our customer, I think this is underway. And of course, we are going to use the next few months to mature the system. It always takes a few months to do that.",

And also, we have High NA tools that, with the long lead times and given this is a very new technology, we're going to recognize revenue not upon shipment, but upon SAC. And that combination of things that we expect is around EUR1 billion to be added to the revenue in the second half. So that's the difference.

But we are not going to give any more color as to what our expectations for EUV sales are going to be. In November of 2025, we'll give you a more concrete picture. Just reiterating, between 30 billion and 40 billion, and it will not be the low point. I think that's the expectation that we've articulated before and that's where we still are.",

I mean, there have been a lot of conversations in the industry about whether litho is going to continue the kind of scaling it has done over the last 20 years, given the challenges with shrinking here from the current level. So maybe in terms of the adoption of High NA and litho itself, Christophe, maybe you can make any comments on your interactions with the foundries and the memory companies have been in terms of using litho as a critical driver of the scaling in semiconductors over the next few years because there has been a lot more conversation in the industry about the limitations of litho.",

          "content": "Well, I think it's two things that are well known. So, first, I think you're hinting to it. I think if we look at the last few years, the scaling, the shrink is slowing down. I think this is not new. And for a long time, litho had an impact on that. I think at this point in time, it's more fundamentals, basically, and related to all the innovation you need to put in place in order to be able to scale the transistors. Now, this being said, scaling is slowing down, so that's the reality we have been facing. What is not slowing down is the need for transistor density. So that curve, which is more slow, practically, is not slowing down. So customers are asking for more density at the same speed they have done for many, many years. And as scaling slows down, I would say shrink becomes even more valuable because shrink is still today the best way to save costs on density. Everything else requires you to just build more transistors with more steps. So shrink today, and that's true today, is still the best way to reduce cost. And sometimes, we say the less you can shrink, the more the value of shrink is going to be. That's one thing. The other thing, of course, is if you shrink less, you need more volume. And more volume can be obtained by exposing more wafers or exposing more stack on the wafer. But in both cases, this drives also more lithography. So we never really feared the reduction of shrink because this drives demand. This is one of the reasons why we have been building capacity. And at the same time, we know that every step we will be able to make in lithography will have huge value for our customers. So this is something also we believe continues to be important. And of course, most probably over time and we'll also talk a bit about that in November, we will look at more ways to help our customers to drive this density up. I will say, no news there. Scaling is slowing down. It's not a difficult thing to say for a litho person, it's just reality. Density does not. Therefore need for more volume, more value for shrink. And I think we can expect to see some opportunities to look at other applications to help our customers to raise this density at cost. We'll talk a lot about that in November because I think it's one of the things we want to explain again.",

It\u2019s essential to understand, as Christophe pointed out at the start of the call, that we assess demand for our tools without focusing on any specific region, including China.

          "content": "Thank you, Christophe, and welcome, everyone. I will first review the third quarter 2024 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the fourth quarter of 2024. Let me start with our third quarter accomplishments. Total net sales came in at EUR7.5 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance driven by more DEEP UV system sales as well as higher installed base management sales. Net sales came in at EUR5.9 billion, which is made up of EUR2.1 billion of EUV sales and EUR3.8 billion of non-EUV sales. Net system sales were driven by logic at 64%, with the remaining 36% coming from memory. Installed Base Management sales for the quarter came in above guidance at EUR1.54 billion due to higher service and upgrade revenue. Gross margin for the quarter came in within guidance at 50.8%. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came in slightly below guidance at EUR1.06 billion while SG&A expenses came in as guided at EUR297 million. In Q3, EUR2.1 billion represented 27.8% of total net sales and resulted in an EPS of EUR5.28. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at a level of EUR5.0 billion, similar to last quarter. We ended Q3 with a free cash flow of EUR534 million, which is somewhat improved relative to last quarter. However, as mentioned last quarter, there continues to be pressure on free cash flow, primarily due to a relatively lower level of order intake, leading to less down payments, and higher inventory levels. The higher inventory level is primarily attributable to EUV, both High NA and Low NA, driven by longer lead times in the build cycle as well as inventory in support of future ramp. Moving to the order book, Q3 net system bookings came in at EUR2.6 billion, which is made up of EUR1.4 billion of EUV bookings and EUR1.2 billion of non-EUV bookings. Net system bookings in the quarter were more or less balanced between memory at 54% and logic at 46%. The relatively low order intake reflects the slow recovery in the traditional end markets as customers remain cautious in the current environment. At the end of Q3 2024, we finished with a backlog of over EUR36 billion. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the fourth quarter of 2024. We expect Q4 total net sales to be between EUR8.8 billion and EUR9.2 billion. We expect our Q4 installed base management sales to be around EUR1.9 billion. Gross margin for Q4 is expected to be between 49% and 50%. I would like to make a few comments on the Q4 guidance. Net sales include the expected revenue recognition of two High NA systems. Installed base management revenue is higher than Q3, primarily as a result of achieving specific EUV performance milestones and some EUV productivity upgrades. Although Q4 revenue is higher than Q3, gross margin is expected to be slightly lower than Q3 as the positive impact from the higher upgrade revenue is more than offset by the dilutive gross margin impact from the expected revenue recognition of the two High NA systems. For the quarter, the dilutive effect on gross margin is approximately 3.5%. Based on the Q4 guidance, we expect 2024 revenue at around EUR28 billion, with a gross margin of around 50.6%, which is slightly lower than 2023 as expected. The expected R&D expenses for Q4 are around EUR1,090 million and SG&A is expected to be around EUR300 million. Our estimated 2024 annualized effective tax rate is expected to be between 16% and 17%. In Q3, ASML paid the first quarterly interim dividend over 2024 of EUR1.52 per ordinary share. The second quarterly interim dividend over 2024 will be EUR1.52 per ordinary share and will be made payable on November 7, 2024. In Q3 2024, no shares were purchased. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to you, Christophe.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger highlighted, it was a solid financial quarter, but there were also a number of market dynamics in the quarter. Starting with our technology, we continue to make good progress on both our new EUV products. On our Low NA technology, we continue to ramp the NXE:3800E system this quarter with EUV customers now rapidly shifting to this new model due to its higher performance, including over a 37% improvement in throughput compared to the NXE:3600D. We have demonstrated the full 220 wafer per hour throughput at the new record overlay in our factory, and we are on track to deliver full specification systems with new system shipment and upgrades from the beginning of next year. As customers transition to the NXE:3800E, the majority of shipments in Q4 are the NXE:3800E systems. Regarding High NA, the two shipped systems are now exposing wafers at our customer, and we expect to recognize the revenue from the system by the end of the year. The first system is in the process of being shipped to a second major customer. Momentum continues to grow with around 10,000 wafers now exposed from multiple logic and memory customers using the High NA system in the joint ASML-imec High NA lab and the systems in the field. At the recent lithography conference, we published new High NA data showing major performance benefits in imaging, overlay, and contrast. Those benefits also indicate significant cost reduction opportunities for both logic and DRAM customers. As a reminder of the value High NA provides, we have demonstrated the system's ability to print features at a resolution of 8 nanometers; compared to a Low NA system, this represents an improvement to nearly 3x in transistor density per exposure. All in all, we have seen continued momentum in EUV technology and we are progressing well relative to customer expectations. With regards to market conditions, while we continue to view AI as a key driver of the industry recovery with potential upside, we see other segments recovering more slowly than anticipated. The recovery will extend well into 2025, which is leading to customer cautiousness and some push outs in their investment. In logic, the slow recovery of end markets such as mobile and PC, together with specific competitive foundry dynamics, has resulted in a slower ramp of new nodes at certain customers who are therefore pushing out some of their fabs and changing their litho demand timing. In memory, the slower market recovery is also resulting in limited capacity addition with the focus still on technology transition, supporting the high bandwidth memory and DDR5 AI-related demand. Lastly, we expect the China business to revert to a more normalized percentage of our business in line with the percentage of China business in our backlog. In summary, while the long-term trends are still very strong and positive, the developments over the past few months combined with customer-specific circumstances have led to a reduced growth curve in 2025 and an overall reduction of our lithography demand. Due to these dynamics over the last quarter, we felt it would be appropriate to make some comments on 2025 at this time versus waiting until our Investor Day next month. With that, I will turn it back over to Roger.",

          "content": "Thanks, Christophe. As we discussed in our Investor Day in 2022, we provided market scenarios for 2025 of between EUR30 billion and EUR40 billion, with a gross margin of between 54% to 56%. Based on the recent market dynamics that Christophe just described, we now see 2025 revenues moving through the lower half of the range, so between EUR30 billion and EUR35 billion. In terms of logic, this is driven by a significant reduction in our expected Low NA shipments in '25 to fewer than 50. We also now expect our China sales to be around 20% of our total revenue next year, trending back towards our historical China percentage and in line with its share of the backlog. With regard to gross margin, one of the key drivers of the expected improvement was Low NA, driven by both an increase in the number of systems as well as a move to the higher margin 3800E system. While the improvement in gross margin for the 3800E has been achieved, the large reduction in EUV unit numbers for next year is significantly margin diluted in comparison to earlier expectations. Also, the reduction of our China sales, which typically contain a high percentage of immersion sales, is dilutive to our gross margin. Therefore, based on the current outlook of lower and the less favorable mix in comparison to the 2022 Investor Day, we now expect a gross margin of between 51% and 53% in 2025. In comparison to 2024, the 2025 gross margin is expected to benefit from the higher gross margin on the 3800E, gradual margin improvement on High NA, and the improvement in EUV service margin, but we'll also see a dilutive margin effect of recognizing more High NA tools in revenue. On operational expenses for 2025, we expect total OpEx to be at the upper end of the bandwidth of EUR5.6 billion to EUR6.1 billion provided during Investor Day in 2022. We will continue with our R&D roadmap and have been able to absorb the significant wage inflation effects since 2022. With that, I once again hand it over to Christophe.",

As we look out longer-term, consistent with what we have previously stated, the secular growth drivers in the semiconductor end markets are still very much intact. AI, energy transition, electrification, and other applications continue to provide a very strong perspective to our industry and ASML business. The expanding application space, along with increasing lithography needs on future technology nodes, drives demands for both advanced and mainstream nodes. In line with most of our industry peers, we continue to see AI as an upside and continue to watch carefully how this will affect us both short and long-term. Despite some of the push outs we have discussed, we continue to prepare for a number of new fabs that are being built across the globe to address the future demand and needs of the industry. Those fabs are spread geographically, aligning our customer strategy with our schedule to take our system. We will therefore continue to build capacity in order to respond to the demand increase that we expect throughout the remainder of this decade. We will provide a more detailed assessment along with the scenarios for 2030 at our Investor Day on November 14, 2024. We look forward to seeing you there.

          "content": "Thanks, Joe. So when it comes to China, I think it's a combination of two things. As we've said before, in the past two years, we've been very much eating into our backlog for China, and that backlog has come to that level simply because in the years before that, we had a fairly low auto-fill rate for China. So as a result of that backlog build-up in the past because of the global market circumstances, we were able to deliver on that backlog. So that's why the China sales in 2023 and 2024 have been so high. So as a result, we indicated before that we expect at a certain point in time for that to normalize, and that is, I think, what you now see in the numbers. So that's one driver. Secondly, I think we all read newspapers, right? We all see that there is speculation around export controls. And also that is a driver for us to take a more cautious view on the China sales. So with that combined, we stated that we believe the China sales for next year are going to be around 20% of our expected sales level for next year. When it comes to DEEP UV and the non-China part of the DEEP UV business, if you do the math a little bit, our expectation is that the DEEP UV business next year will be lower than it is this year. So we believe DEEP UV will go down a bit. But you're right. I mean, with the China business going down, as we've indicated, that means that the non-China part of the DEEP UV business will go up. And the main reason is that if you look at the more advanced nodes and if you do the math on the growth that you might anticipate in the EUV business for next year, you will see that there is quite some growth there. In the combination of Low NA and High NA, you will see quite some growth there. I think what you're going to see is that the non-China part of the DEEP UV business is sort of following that trend. So the attach rate, if you want to call it like that, of the DEEP UV business to the EUV business will be similar. So the growth rate you will see in EUV, you will sort of see back also in the growth rates for the non-China part of the DEEP UV business.",

I can certainly appreciate the lower mix of Low NA, but for total revenue it would still be kind of within the low end of the target range. I think it would still imply that your immersion shipments may be down year-over-year, it sounds like still better you're thinking about from the target model, which I think would be a positive for in terms of offsetting just some of the mix. So maybe can you help us unpack that a little bit of just how do we think about the immersion relative to what you were thinking about at the Analyst Day in 2022 and that mix effect?",

I think the immersion expectation has gone up a bit, but with everything I just told you, including our view on chart, I think immersion has come down a bit, and all in all, I think our immersion view is not dramatically different from what we held out at the Investor Day. The line, if you simply contrast the gross margin that we have that we now articulate for 2025 and compare that to the gross margin that we articulated three years ago, it really is to a very large extent, it is driven by EUV. And there are two elements in EUV that do this. One element is volume, so the volume that we have on EUV now in our model with 50 is substantially below the numbers that you saw in the Investor Day of November \u201822, but there is also a mixed effect in there, because in 2022 we were looking at the high end of the mix, i.e., the 3800 was going to dominate. The fact we were expecting a few 4000 in there as a result of the dynamics in the market, you actually, quite a few, 3600 in 2025 as well. The 3800 will dominate, but it will clearly be 3600 in there as well. So there is also an ASP and gross margin mix effect in there. It's that combination of particularly a significantly lower number of EUV units and also the mix effect in the EUV that is primarily driving down the gross margin expectation in comparison to what we were looking at in November of \u201822. And the unit effect is by far the biggest effect in that explanation.",

I think, that we have to, of course, over time reconfirm the dynamic of the market, I will say for the second half of '25 and '26. So if you think about mathematically, we have talked about push out, because we really see our customer delaying basically their fabs. We don't see a customer basically changing their mind on those fabs. So that's why we refer to push out. Of course, '26 is an opportunity to see those tools back, but like I say, there's still a long way until 2026, and we will continue to watch the market dynamic there.",

But for the rest, I think our customer continues to confirm that when it comes to power, when it comes to PC and automotive, the recovery is not what I think A1 had wished for. And that affects, I would say, a large part of our customers on all segments and applications. I think we also indeed mentioned as well some competitive dynamics on logic. I think that also has been expressed at plans in the press in the last three months. I think that's not really new for you. And this also contributes to some of the push out. So, I think those two things are really the two dynamics that have come up in the last few months to a level where our customers basically started to really make, I would say, decisions that were in line with their expectations both on the total market, but also maybe in some cases on the share they may end up having in some of the logic market.",

So I think the interest is high indeed and increasing. The discussion on the 12 inches reticle is a bit of a discussion about what else could we do in the future to further improve the productivity of High NA first and potentially of the tool. So the conference you referred to is a bit of a technical conference. So people like to discuss basically what could come next. It was a good engagement. This was a sign indeed also of the fact that more are starting to count on High NA into the future. And that timeframe is not at all aligned with the 5000 or 5200. So I think there's absolutely no connection between what we do with High NA and what we may do in the future with the 12 inches A reticle. To give you an idea, that discussion may become more concrete towards the end of the decade or the beginning of the next one. So, it's really a long-term technical discussion we have engaged with our customers, and we are happy to discuss with them because this can provide a significant productivity improvement for High NA, but for lithography in general.

Now what I've also said in the introduction is when we look at the long term, when we listen to our peers, I think that the bullishness about the long-term opportunity in this market is strong. We share that, which means that at some point of time, the need for more capacity will be there. So what we do, we continue to execute on the long lead time items, things like building some equipment. On the other hand, because the short-term market is a bit softer than we expected previously, we are also slowing down basically any short-term investment. When it comes to people, material, etcetera, we don't have to do that today. We will do that when we have again visibility for larger demand. But the structure of our capability, we want to still drive, because I will say when a recovery takes more time to happen, if you believe in the long-term trajectory of the market, there is always a point where you have to deliver more tools, and we want to be ready for that as well.",

What was once uncertain has now shown that a certain level of demand from specific customers is unlikely to materialize. This realization led us to conclude that we could no longer maintain a large window of EUR30 billion to EUR40 billion globally. Consequently, we need to adjust that window to the lower half.

So I was just coming back and it seems to be really two customers that have been well in the press having some issues. So we would have thought that you would see some swap out in the orders in terms of customers. Did you see any sign of like upside risk into some orders at least a bit offsetting or interest related to these customer issues? Or is it a scenario that your customers gave you some too optimistic forecast in light of a big shortage of EUV you had in recent years and therefore the swap out will take much stronger than expected?

And the first one, I think you see yourself as you mentioned, the recovery on mobile and PC to be weaker than expected initially. This has an impact, I will say, on the capacity planning, but also maybe on expectation of capacity planning. So, I think we use the word cautiousness a few times in the call. When you become cautious, I think this means you are careful on the short-term, but also a bit on the midterm. So, you have a bit of a double hit if you want with the cautiousness. So that's the first one. On the second one, I think we also mentioned some upside on the AI, because we still believe that the overall demand for those applications is there and continues to increase. So, if we look at the server demand, we see there a very nice recovery, a lot of that has to do with AI application. So we talk about upside, which also means that the overall dynamic of the market is still playing, and we felt the need to hover an update for next year based on some of the development we have seen. I think in no way we are also saying that there is a complete understanding of how the entire market will continue to play out in the next few months.

And I think we are more in the second situation today. We continue to generate data. We talked about 10,000 wafers exposed. These are all to demonstrate basically the performance of the tool, on logic, memory, and all of that is helping our customers to, I would say, to make their plan of insertion and adoption a bit more concrete and start to define some very specific milestones. So, this is a bit where we are. We are very happy with the progress on High NA. We are very happy with the performance.

So that dynamic should also be considered. What we're looking at today, I would say, I think we're when it comes to EUV, because obviously that is relevant in this conversation. I think DEEP UV given the significantly lower order lead times is less relevant here. But when it comes to EUV, at this stage, I think it's fair to say that we're sort of fully booked for the low end of the guidance that we've provided. In order to get to the midpoint of the guidance, I would say that we need another, let's say, EUR2 billion in order to hit the midpoint of the guidance before the end of the year. So, EUR2 billion should then come in this quarter. When it comes to flexibility, I think there is some flexibility. To the extent that orders would come in Q1, I think we would still probably be able to cater to those orders in 2025. I think we build in sufficient flexibility to create that.",

And that's especially important to do that when you are the single supplier of EUV tools. I think that's the responsibility we have. I think the discussion on pre-build started when we saw a situation where we may not be able to meet the demand with the output of one year. And then to be consistent with my previous point, prebuild in the lower year is a way to do that. So, this means also that this number of pre-build tools will of course evolve with the market situation. And if we are in a situation where the market is low, we don't see the need to do that, except for specific requests of our customers. But what we have seen also in the past is that things tend to change, and I think the mix between our customers is also evolving back and forth over time.

I mean, in terms of your guidance for next year, I mean, when we look at the numbers, it looks like your growth in DUV outside China is going to be incredibly strong. I mean, and also when I've looked at ASML for so many years, I mean, the view is that ASML, when you give one-year guidance, you tend to be within that ballpark. You don't tend to be wrong in those terms. So I mean, how confident do you feel that the DUV outside China is going to see significant growth next year given that DUV does tend to have shorter lead times than EUV?

We're looking at about similar growth as we see it for EUV. So leave it to your own imagination how you want to qualify that. But it is the two things go hand-in-hand. We see quite a bit of DEEP UV demand also particularly I would say on the leading nodes. So therefore, I think assumptions on a strong correlation between capacity build on EV and capacity build on the non-Chinese part of the DUV, I think that is a realistic assumption. So therefore, with that very strong correlation as we see it, we believe that the underpinning for that demand increase, something we believe is robust.",

So that's the reason why we believe it was prudent to say we should be looking at the lower end. Of course, in the next couple of months, we're going to once again talk to customers and listen to their plans, etcetera, etcetera.

          "content": "Thank you, Christophe. And welcome everyone. I will first review the fourth quarter and full year 2024 financial accomplishments and then provide guidance on the first quarter of 2025. Let me start with our fourth quarter accomplishments. In the fourth quarter of 2024, total net sales were \u20ac9.3 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance, primarily due to installed base revenue. As expected, it also includes revenue recognition on two High NA EUV systems. Net system sales were at \u20ac7.1 billion, which includes \u20ac2.9 billion from EUV sales and \u20ac4.2 billion from non-EUV sales. Net system sales were driven by Logic at 61% with the remaining 39% coming from Memory. Installed Base management sales for the quarter were above guidance at \u20ac2.1 billion, primarily driven by additional upgrade business. Gross margin for the quarter was above guidance at 51.7% due to a combination of additional upgrade business and lower than planned costs associated with the new product introduction of High NA systems in the field. On operating expenses, R&D expenses came at \u20ac1.116 billion in line with guidance, while SG&A expenses came in above guidance at \u20ac318 million due to year-end payroll adjustments and a pull in of IT costs. The effective tax rate in Q4 was 21.5% as a result of a one-off tax expense related to a historic tax position, bringing the full year ETR to 18.6%. For 2025, we expect an annualized effective tax rate of around 17%. Net income in Q4 was \u20ac2.7 billion representing 29.1% of total net sales and resulting in an EPS of \u20ac6.85. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments at a level of \u20ac12.7 billion. We ended Q4 with a free cash flow of \u20ac8.839 billion, which is significantly higher relative to last quarter's, with the majority of cash coming in at the very end of the quarter. Moving to the order book, Q4 net system bookings came in at \u20ac7.1 billion which is made up of \u20ac3 billion of EUV and \u20ac4.1 billion of non-EUV. Net system bookings in the quarter were driven by Logic with 61% of the bookings with Memory accounting for the remaining 39%. At this point, I would like to briefly comment on the reporting of our bookings going forward. As we have said in the past, our order flow on a quarterly basis can be lumpy and does not necessarily reflect our business momentum accurately. Our sales guidance is primarily based on customer input as part of our planning cycle. With this in mind, we will continue to report bookings on a quarterly basis through 2025, but will no longer report on bookings thereafter. As of 2026, we will report the total systems backlog on an annual basis. Looking at the full year, net sales came in at \u20ac28.3 billion with a gross margin of 51.3%. EUV system sales realized from 44 systems including High NA were \u20ac8.3 billion, 9% lower compared to 2023. DUV system sales grew 4% to \u20ac12.8 billion. Metrology & Inspection systems sales increased 20% to \u20ac646 million. Looking at the market segments for 2024, Logic system revenue was \u20ac13.2 billion, 17% lower than 2023. Memory system revenue was \u20ac8.6 billion, 44% higher than 2023, and Installed Base Management sales were \u20ac6.5 billion, 16% higher than 2023. We concluded 2024 with a net systems backlog of around \u20ac36 billion. In 2024, we continued to invest in innovation across our full product portfolio, increasing R&D spending to \u20ac4.3 billion in 2024, or about 15% of sales. SG&A increased to \u20ac1.2 billion in 2024, which was about 4% of sales. Net income for the full year was \u20ac7.6 billion, 26.8% of net sales, resulting in an earnings per share of \u20ac19.25. In 2024 we generated free cash flow of \u20ac9.1 billion. We returned \u20ac3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buybacks in 2024. With that, I would like to turn to our expectations for the first quarter of 2025. We expect Q1 total net sales to be between \u20ac7.5 billion and \u20ac8 billion. We expect our Q1 installed base management sales to be around \u20ac2.1 billion. Gross margin for Q1 is expected to be between 52% and 53%. This is primarily driven by a positive effect from no High NA revenue recognition in the quarter, partly offset by lower immersion volume. The expected R&D expenses for Q1 are around \u20ac1.14 billion and SG&A is expected to be around \u20ac290 million. In Q4, ASML paid the second quarterly interim dividend over 2024 of \u20ac1.52 per ordinary share. ASML intends to declare a total dividend for the year 2024 of \u20ac6.4 per ordinary share. The third interim dividend of \u20ac1.52 per ordinary share will be made payable on February 19, 2025. Recognizing this third interim dividend and the two interim dividends of \u20ac1.52 per ordinary share paid in 2024, this leads to a final dividend proposal to the general meeting of \u20ac1.84 per ordinary share. In Q4 2024, no shares were purchased. With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Christophe.",

          "content": "Thank you, Roger. As Roger has highlighted, we finished 2024 with a strong quarter. We are extremely thankful to the whole ASML team that worked very hard to realize these results. In 2024, we have also successfully achieved a number of technology milestones, including the release of a number of new products critical for our customers' technology roadmaps. On our Low NA EUV technology, the NXE:3800E, we demonstrated the full system specification in our factory with 220 wafers per hour throughput at a new record overlay. We are on track to deliver new systems at full specification and start upgrades for the systems already at our customers during the first half of 2025. We continue to work with our customers to drive the maturation of the system to support their ramp to high volume manufacturing. On High NA EUV, we completed the installation and customer acceptance on two systems in Q4. Customers have now run over ten thousand wafers on High NA systems and their feedback has been very positive. They are seeing major performance benefits in imaging, overlay, and contrast which also provide significant cost reduction opportunities for both Logic and DRAM processes. We continue to work with our customers to define the exact insertion point for High NA in their processes. We also shipped a third system in Q4 that is now undergoing installation and qualification. On DUV, we shipped the first NXT:870B, the latest generation KrF system capable of throughput of over 400 wafers per hour, and the NXT:2150i, the latest generation immersion DUV system capable of achieving throughput over 310 wafers per hour and overlay performance of equal to or less than 1 nanometer. And finally, in Applications, after close collaboration with multiple customers, we have successfully completed the evaluations and recognized first revenue from a number of eScan 1100 Multi-beam Inspection systems. All-in-all, our product pipeline remains strong, supporting the roadmap requirements of our customers and driving our overall competitiveness. We will share more performance data at the SPIE Lithography conference in February. Looking to 2025, we see full-year revenue between \u20ac30 billion and \u20ac35 billion and gross margin between 51% and 53%. Consistent with our view from last quarter, artificial intelligence has become the key driver for growth in our industry at this moment. As we have witnessed in 2024, AI has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all customers equally in the short term. If AI demand continues to be strong and customers are successful in bringing on additional capacity online to support that demand, there is potential opportunity towards the upper end of our range. On the other hand, there are also risks related to customers and geopolitics that could drive results towards the lower end of the range. Looking at market segments, we currently expect Logic to be up versus 2024 with the ramp of leading-edge nodes while we expect Memory to remain strong, similar to 2024. With respect to our Installed Base business, we expect revenue to grow versus 2024 driven by both service and upgrades as part of a growing install base, to which EUV's contribution is continuing to grow. Our China business in 2023 and 2024 was relatively high because of our ability to execute on a backlog that was created after low order fill rates in previous years. For 2025 and beyond, we expect our China business to go back to a more normalized percentage of our sales. Looking longer term, overall the semiconductor market remains strong with artificial intelligence creating growth but also a shift in market dynamics as I highlighted earlier. These dynamics will lead to a shift in the mix of end-market products towards more HPC and HBM which requires more advanced Logic and DRAM. For ASML, we anticipate that an increased number of critical lithography exposures for these advanced Logic and Memory processes will drive increasing demand for ASML products and services. As a result, we see a 2030 revenue opportunity between \u20ac44 billion and \u20ac60 billion with gross margins expected between 56% and 66%, as we presented in Investor Day 2024.

So I would still see that as a one-off benefit to the quarter. I wouldn't necessarily read into that, that we're going to have significant savings that were not recognized when we provided the 51% to 53% guidance. But you are right. In the second half we did say that we expect the gross margin to be a little bit lower because the revenue recognition on High NA is to be skewed towards the second half.",

The first one is the one you repeated, which is the performance has to be attractive, have to be good. I think that's most probably one requirement we check at this point in time. The second one is going to be the maturity of the platform. And there, as we typically try to ship a few early tools. These are over 5,000 so that we can start to work aggressively on maturity. We are going to start shipping the 5200 which is a tool more fit to high volume manufacturing. And then we'll have to spend a bit of time to demonstrate that the maturity research is such that customers are comfortable to use it in production. So that process typically takes 12 months, 18 months. It depends a bit on where we start with the tool. And the discussion is a discussion we have I would say on a regular basis because again depending on the progress, of course, the appetite to move faster or slower is going to be adjusted.",

I mean the new wave. Do you actually see your customer pulling in their order as a result? Do you see China orders decline quicker in the coming months because of everything that has been pulled in? And also I know that you mentioned in the prerecord video that China was\u2014China's expectations on U.S. restrictions have been falling into expectations.

So when we last spoke we said the key dynamic on China is that and why China was so very strong in 2023 and 2024 now, because for a number of years we have been building up a very significant backlog because all the fill rate for China was so low. That is the reason why the China sales in 2023 and 2024 was so high. And that is also the reason now that around this point in time where we have eaten significantly into that backlog, we say that backlog is being normalized. And that also means that we believe that the sales to China will be a more normalized percentage. And as we said, as we said we think that is a low 20% number that China will represent in 2025 in our total sales numbers. But that is what is going on. The order intake that we received from China in the fourth quarter I would call is healthy. But it's not an order intake that is in any way dramatic or skewed or whatever. That's not the case. It is, again, a relatively normal order intake for China. And therefore, I think the expectation that we articulated last time is that China will be a more normalized percentage of our sales. I think that's what you will see in 2025 and frankly, beyond.",

So we've had quite a few conversations around your decision to phase out bookings information, and as we understand it, only provide a backlog annually. Can you talk us through the decision to do that? And I guess what are you expecting to be the reaction from investors? And is this a response to the increased focus you've been seeing on bookings that seems to have been taking place over the last 12 to 18 months?",

          "content": "I think we explained it in the video. And just to recap where we are, the way we come up with our annual guidance is really based on the review process that we have with our customers. We have ongoing dialogues with our customers. And based on that, that gives us the insight into their business and that gives us the basis to then articulate at the start of the year what we think the total sales level for the year is going to be. As you've seen in previous quarters and as we have highlighted multiple times, order intake can be very lumpy. And that is because the total size of the orders per customer are pretty significant, given the tool prices for High NA tools, which are pretty substantive. If customers take a number of tools, which they typically do, you get to very, very high numbers. And that means that if you have a few large customers that place an order in one quarter, they typically wouldn't do it in one quarter and then get another mass order intake in the quarter thereafter. So as a result of that, you see sometimes very high order intake in one quarter and then lower order intake in other quarters that do not necessarily reflect the business momentum that we enjoy. And that's why we think that the market is better off with us having a robust discussion and robustly underpinned guidance that we provide at the beginning of the year. We think that is more meaningful than these swings in the order pattern that you've seen before. If you look at the past quarters, you do see that the market looks at these orders and sometimes the reactions, both in terms of positive and in terms of negative order intake, the reactions can be quite significant. And that has been the reason that we have been telling the market that order intake is lumpy. We have been saying that it doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect the business momentum accurately, but we do see very significant market response to it. And as a result of that, we have reached a conclusion that maybe the market is better off with what I just gave you, including an annual update of the backlog. So from that regard, we came to the conclusion that less is actually more. This is something that we discussed with quite a few of you when we had the investor day. We discussed this quite extensively with many investors and the conversations that we had there gave the confidence to Christophe, myself, and the full team that the decision that we just took is the right decision for the company, for its stakeholders.",

One of the pieces of guidance that you were talking about in the last set of results was, you were probably at the bottom end for EUV bookings to see the low end of guidance. And since you've had a very strong quarter of bookings now, \u20ac3 billion of EUV, are you sort of more confident in the midpoint of guidance or are you starting to see 2026 EUV orders come through as well, given the typical 18-month lead times?",

With the \u20ac3 billion we've recorded, we've achieved that target. Therefore, it appears we are either beginning to prepare for 2026 or moving toward the upper end of our guidance. However, the timing remains a key factor that depends on various elements. You are correct that we aimed for \u20ac2 billion in order intake for EUV, and having reached \u20ac3 billion gives us strong confidence regarding orders for at least the EUV segment at the midpoint. As for DEEP UV, we are not fully covered yet, but our coverage is substantial for the midpoint of the guidance as well. However, as Christophe noted, timing issues can arise, and customers can often adjust their orders throughout the year, either bringing them forward or delaying them from the last quarter.",

Could we see a front-loaded capacity build in a way that 2025 will be a big build to prepare for 2026? So in other words, I mean, how do you think about the phasing of this strong node as first year could be bigger and then you add on a bit less in 2027?

That's what we see. So no normal pattern. The other thing we mentioned in our commentary is we see that maybe there is an opportunity to ramp a bit faster if the demand remains strong.

I'm not going to ask you the impact on DeepSeek on the demand for AI but you describe some upside on the AI potential if we get the capacity in the second half or, if the demand remains strong. But similarly, I mean if you look at the iPhone, which, or Apple or iPhone, which supposedly is a very significant part of your demand on the leading edge nodes, do you think AI is big enough to offset some downside if we see downside on the iPhone, at least in the short term because in the long term you describe at your CMD that it's neutralizing.

I also want to highlight TSMC's recent call, where they mentioned a potential recovery in the mobile sector for the first time. There's nothing extraordinary happening there, but as we progress through the ramp, we anticipate an increase in capacity over time, and we won\u2019t see peak capacity for a while.

And then secondly, what are the sort of plausible things that we should be watching for and concerned about that would justify the back the lower end of guidance? Is it export control restrictions?

So I think we delivered last year on exactly on the guidance that we provided in the year. The reason why I think the situation is also not comparable is that last year we started the year saying we think this year will be comparable to 2023. I think this year we started the year with a clear growth perspective at the midpoint somewhere around 15%. So I don't think the situation is similar. Yes, we have a strong, yes, we have a strong backlog. Yes, we had a strong order intake in the last, but I think, Christophe discussed it on the call and he will provide the color and context.

We've seen major pushout of some of the capacity for some of the customers. I think through our guidance this year, we see that this risk is a lot lower in terms of volume. But I think Roger said it, that's always possible. So I think we are very transparent that we share with you the fact that if we look at the total dynamic, that some of those pushouts may not be completely excluded; that's what the final range. So I think that's not more than that, I would say. Geopolitics, we also mentioned that. There, it's even more difficult, of course, to quantify because we just had new export control being released. So there's no expectation of anything on our side, but this is also experience this call a bit for prudence on our side.

I think what we said is we see those, those new products mostly calling for a bit of an acceleration of Moore's Law and therefore our customer being more aggressive when it comes to technology transition. I think in some extent you see a bit of that already with 2-nanometer and mostly what will come after that. And I think we also said in November that historically, this has always driven more demand for advanced litho. That's of course part of the discussion we are having as we speak with our customers. So part of the shift we see, I think that's one that we described as a positive one for us back in November. And I think when it comes to the trend, the trend is there and well, you're asking very detailed questions on, future node. We don't have the detailed answer yet, but the trend is definitely there.",

I had another one on the customer visibility side of things it's encouraging, obviously, to see that you finished 2024 strongly in terms of orders. But if I look at 2024 overall, you've had a fairly low level of orders from the logic community, lowest since 2020. Now I understand the multiple reasons why it's been weak in recent quarters. So really I'm sort of interested in a more forward-looking view. You've already explained that 2025 is essentially fully booked. But as I look to 2026, assuming growth, as you've described, loosely, Roger, it's something like 30% to 40% booked for next year, depending on one's assumptions. So then if I think of your lead times and the points you were making about the stated customer plans for their CapEx, the 20-nanometer migration, and in particular, the high-volume ramp in the first part of next year, don't you need to see order commitments come in for EUV over the first half of this year in order to be able to meet those customer needs on time?",

We should continue to see strong order intake in the first two quarters, which I believe is a fair expectation.",

When we had a strong cycle a couple of years ago, your backlog was in the $40 billion range. Do you see more flexibility with your capacity to bring the lead times down, especially with higher EUV mix and concentration of customers? Or would you be more prudent and try to build a longer backlog?

We've demonstrated that maximum throughput and are currently rolling it out. The new tools we are delivering to customers will gradually meet the specifications for the installed tools. Throughout this year, we will ensure these tools also align with the higher expectations, and you can expect to see reports on our improvements and the revenue associated with achieving these higher throughputs. The 220 has been demonstrated, and we are in the process of rolling it out alongside the 3800s currently in the field. Looking beyond 2025, we are focusing on ensuring that the long lead time items are secured, which will give us the flexibility to meet higher demand. With our growth projections for the second half of this decade, especially for 2030, it\u2019s evident that we need to increase capacity. We're building the necessary infrastructure to ensure we're prepared to respond promptly once we receive clear signals from customers about demand. That\u2019s our approach.",

Last quarter, I think you gave us some elements to rationalize how you could get to the middle of the range. And you gave notably two elements. One was on the non-EUV, non-China that was supposed to grow largely by the double digits, let's say, 50%. So can you maybe come back on that and confirm if that's still what you expect? And the second element was about the Installed Base Management revenue that you said could be at about \u20ac7.2 billion. But if you take the first quarter where you guide for \u20ac2.1 billion, it gives a run rate if you multiply it by 4 of much bigger than \u20ac7.5 billion, \u20ac8.4 billion, \u20ac8.5 billion, so \u20ac1 billion above.

As you may recall from last year, there can be some fluctuations on a quarterly basis, primarily influenced by upgrades, which can vary significantly. Our visibility into upgrades is not as strong as it is for the service business, but for now, I recommend sticking with the \u20ac7.5 billion as the appropriate figure. Regarding the non-China, non-EUV business, you mentioned 50%, which I believe is on the higher side. This figure exceeds what I had estimated in my model during our previous discussions. I think it's more accurate to consider it similar to the EUV business, which would indicate a roughly 40% increase, and that's where I expect we'll ultimately land.",

So how do you put the 2 and 2 together that you will know whether the customer is going to use these tools in high-volume manufacturing only later in the year or next year, but you're already possibly building these tools for the customer? So is there a risk to the customer first at the end of the year that, well, actually, we're not going to implement the tools into production next year, and then these orders don't happen in 2026, which are there in the backlog today?",

Typically, you start with research and development, and then you proceed to a reasonable implementation. The tools in our backlog are intended to support that process. We generally anticipate a few tools per customer, which are adequate to begin the initial stage of implementation. After that, we expect that new bookings for high NA will likely involve larger implementations in the subsequent stage, which will occur later.

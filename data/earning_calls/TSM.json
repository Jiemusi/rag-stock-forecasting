          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the first quarter 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter. First quarter revenue increased 12.1% sequentially at NT terms or 11.6% in U.S. dollar terms as our first quarter business was supported by strong HPC and automotive-related demand. First quarter gross margin increased 2.9 percentage points sequentially to 55.6%, mainly as we continue to sell our value and improve cost. Operating margin increased 3.9 percentage points sequentially to 45.6%, primarily due to lower vaccine donation expense as compared to the fourth quarter. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 7.82, and ROE was 36.2%. Now let\u2019s move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 30%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 50% of wafer revenue. Now moving on to revenue contribution by platform. All 6 platforms increased in the first quarter. Smartphone increased 1% quarter-over-quarter to account for 40% of our first quarter revenue. HPC increased 26% to account for 41%. IoT increased 5% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 26% to account for 5%. And DCE increased 8% to account for 3%. Moving on to balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.3 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 83 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 63 billion in accrued liabilities and others and the increase of TWD 30 billion in short-term loans, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 21 billion in accounts payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 19 billion as we raised TWD 20 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 38 days, while days of inventory remained at 88 days. Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 372 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 262 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for second quarter \u201821 cash dividend. Bonds payable increased by TWD 20 billion due to the bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 87 billion to TWD 1.2 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $9.38 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let\u2019s turn now to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 17.6 billion and USD 18.2 billion, which represents a 1.9% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 28.8, gross margin is expected to be between 56% and 58%, operating margin between 45% and 47%. In addition, we maintain our 2022 capital budget to be between USD 40 million and USD 44 billion. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of TWD 491.1 billion or USD 17.6 billion, which is above the high end of our guidance, mainly due to better demand from smartphone and automotive-related applications than our forecast 3 months ago and customer\u2019s continuing need to ensure supply security with the emergency of COVID-related uncertainties. Moving into second quarter 2022, we expect our business to be supported by HPC and automotive-related demand, partially offset by smartphone seasonality. On the inventory front, we expect the supply chain to continue to maintain a higher level of inventory as compared to the historical seasonal level for a longer period of time, prolonged by recent COVID-related supply chain disruptions and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tension. On the demand side, despite the recent macro-related uncertainties, we continue to observe the structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand, underpinned by the industry makeup trend of 5G and HPC-related applications. This multiyear megatrend will support device unit volume growth, and much more importantly, drive substantial semiconductor content enrichment in many young devices across HPC, smartphone, automotive, and IoT applications. With our technology leadership, TSMC is well positioned to capture the strong structural demand with our advanced and specialty technologies. And we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022. 2022 will be another strong growth year for TSMC. And we expect our full year growth to likely be at or exceed the high end of our guidance range of mid- to high 20s percent in U.S. dollar terms. Next, given the recent constraint in the tool supply chain, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC worked closely with all our tool suppliers to plan our CapEx and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers are facing great challenges in their supply chain from the continued impact of COVID-19, which are creating labor component and chip constraints in their supply chains and extending towards delivery lead time for both advanced and mature nodes. TSMC is working closely with our suppliers and taking several actions to do our part to address the supply chain challenges. We have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress. We have sent several teams on-site to support our suppliers and are working closely with them to identify critical chips that are gauging the tool delivery. We are working with our customers to prioritize our wafer capacity to support those critical chips to help mitigate the chip constraint issue. By taking such actions, we do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan, and we continue to work closely with our suppliers on 2023 and beyond so that we can ramp up our capacity to meet customers\u2019 demand. Now I will talk about the materials supply update. TSMC operates a well-established enterprise risk management system to identify and access all relevant risks and proactively implement risk mitigation strategies. In terms of material supply, TSMC\u2019s strategy is to continuously develop multi-source supply solutions to build a well-diversified global supplier base and to improve the local supply chain. For specialty chemicals and gases, including neon, we source from multiple suppliers in different regions, and we have prepared a certain level of inventory stock on hand. We are also working closely with our suppliers to further strengthen the resilience and the sustainability of our supply chain. Thus, we do not expect any impact on our operations from material supply. Finally, let me talk about the N3 and N3E status. Our N3 technology will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance, and cost for our customers. Our N3 schedule is unchanged, and we\u2019re on track for volume production in the second half of 2022 with good yield. We expect the ramp of N3 to be driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. We continue to see a high level of customer engagement at N3 and expect more new tape-outs for N3 for the year as compared with N5 and N7. N3E will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power, and yield. We also observed a high level of customer engagement at N3E, and volume production is scheduled for 1 year after N3. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. In terms of profitability, the initial outlook for new nodes is always challenging. And the increasing process complexity of leading nodes such as the N3 brings even greater challenges to achieving the corporate average gross margin in 7 to 8 quarters, particularly as our corporate profitability has improved with a long-term gross margin target of 53% and higher. As we have done at prior nodes, we will continue to work diligently with our cost improvement and reduction efforts to ensure that we earn the right profitability and return on N3. With our technology leadership and strong customer demand, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention.",

How does TSMC evaluate the impact from the inflation and the geopolitical tension? We understand that TSMC works with customers closely, but most of your customers probably don\u2019t have the full picture of end demand fluctuation. At the same time, TSMC has to bear the risk to build capacity a couple of years ahead to make the decision earlier, so how can TSMC provide more color to strengthen investor confidence?

And our CapEx and capacity expansion plan are actually based on customers\u2019 long-term demand profile, underpinned by the industry megatrend. We do not build capacity based on speculation. In advanced technology nodes, we have a leading position. In our mature nodes, our capacity is built to support customer demand for our differentiated specialty technologies.

          "content": "Yes. Gokul, this is Wendell. It\u2019s too early to talk about the revenue contribution as N3 will not begin volume production until the second half of 2022 with revenue contribution starting in 2023. In addition, as the structural demand underpinned by the industry megatrends is driving growth across all our nodes, the specific percentage of the new nodes as compared to the historical pattern may be less meaningful in the future. But overall, we are confident that our 3-nanometer will be the most advanced foundry technology when it is introduced. And with the strong customer engagement and tape-out activity, our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC, just like N5 and N7 families. Now about the gross margin, as C.C. said, the initial outlook for new nodes is always challenging. And the increasing process complexity of leading nodes such as N3 brings even greater challenges to achieving the corporate average gross margin in 7 to 8 quarters, and partially also because our corporate profitability has increased and our new long-term gross margin target of 53% and higher. Now it is a bit early to say when N3 can reach the corporate average gross margin at this stage because the volume production hasn\u2019t started yet. However, we will continue to work diligently on selling our value and cost improvement to ensure that we earn the right profitability and return. Now even considering the increasing process complexity of advanced nodes such as N3, we believe our technology leadership, manufacturing, and capacity support, and ability to earn our customers\u2019 trust will enable us to earn a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher.",

But right now, we see a lot of capacity being announced from many foundries in these older specialty and mature process technologies, let\u2019s say, defined as 28-nanometer and above. So could TSMC talk a little bit about the growth rate for these mature process technologies going forward? Is it going to be materially higher than the 3% to 5% that we have seen in the past? In most cases, we have seen older nodes grow for 4 to 5 years and then kind of stagnate.

Gokul, we forecast the growth rate of the overall semiconductor ex-memory industry to accelerate to high single-digit percentage level in the next 5 years as compared to around 4% CAGR in the past 10 years. The higher demand at mature nodes will be driven by structural factors, such as an increase in long-term demand for certain specialty technologies due to the multiyear industry megatrends of 5G and HPC and increasing silicon content in many end devices as well as the acceleration of digitalization. TSMC\u2019s strategy at mature nodes is to work closely with our customers to develop specialty technology solutions to meet their requirements and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers.

So there has been concerns that you may not really get a fair deal out of this a little bit of complex relationship. One concern, very specifically, I heard this that you may end up basically teaching this competitor, enabling their accelerated roadmap.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the second quarter 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the third quarter. Second quarter revenue increased 8.8% sequentially in NT or 3.4% in U.S. dollars, as our second quarter business was supported by strong HPC, IoT and automotive-related demand. Second quarter gross margin increased 3.5 percentage points sequentially to 59.1%, slightly ahead of our guidance, as we enjoyed a more favorable foreign exchange rate, cost improvement and value selling. Likewise, operating margin increased 3.5 percentage points sequentially to 49.1%, in line with our gross margin increase. Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 9.14 and ROE was 39.4%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 21% of wafer revenue in the second quarter while 7-nanometer accounted for 30%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 51% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. All six platforms increased in the second quarter. Smartphone increased 3% quarter-over-quarter to account for 38% of our second quarter revenue. HPC increased 13% to account for 43%. IoT increased 14% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 14% to account for 5%. And digital consumer electronics increased 5% to account for 3%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD1.4 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 22 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD 47 billion in accounts payable, partially offset by the decrease of TWD 29 billion in short-term loans. Long-term interest-bearing debts increased by TWD 124 billion, mainly as we raised TWD 109 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased one day to 37 days while days of inventory increased seven days to 95 days as we prebuild M5 wafers and increased raw materials inventory. Now let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 339 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 218 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD 71 billion for third quarter '21 cash dividend. Bonds payable increased by TWD 109 billion as a result of this quarter's bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased by TWD 102 billion to TWD 1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled $7.34 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between $19.8 billion and $20.6 billion, which represents an 11.2% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD 29.7, gross margin is expected to be between 57.5% and 59.5%, operating margin between 47% and 49%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our second quarter and third quarter profitability. As a reminder, six factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership technology development and ramp-up, pricing, cost, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate. Compared to first quarter, our second quarter gross margin increased by 350 basis points sequentially to 59.1%, mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate, cost improvement and value selling. Compared to our second quarter guidance, our actual gross margins exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago as our guidance was based on exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD 28.8 whereas the actual second quarter exchange rate was $1 to TWD 29.42. This created about a 90 basis point difference in our actual second quarter gross margin versus our original guidance. We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decline 60 basis points sequentially to 58.5% at the midpoint, as a slightly more favorable exchange rate assumption will be more than offset by higher inflationary costs, including higher raw material and electricity costs. Looking ahead on our profitability, we will face challenges from rising inflationary costs from raw materials, utilities and tools, increasing process complexity of leading nodes, new investments in mature nodes and overseas fab expansions. Despite the manufacturing cost challenges, and excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over, taking the other five factors into consideration, we continue to believe a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our effective tax rate. For 2022, we expect our tax rate to be between 10% and 11%. Starting in 2023, we will see the expiration of certain tax exemptions in Taiwan, and our effective tax rate will increase. However, the Taiwan government is in the process of drafting certain new tax exemption regulations and is currently in the comment period. Therefore, we will provide a further update on the outlook of our tax rate in 2023 and beyond when more details become available. Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with our near-term growth outlook. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of TWD 534 billion or $18.2 billion, supported by HPC, IoT and automotive-related demand. Moving into the third quarter of 2022, we expect our business to be supported by continued demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer technologies. On the inventory side, due to the softening device momentum in smartphones, PCs and consumer end market segments, we observe the supply chain is already taking action and expect inventory levels to reduce throughout the second half of 2022. After two years of pandemic-driven stay-at-home demand, this type of adjustment is reasonable, in our view. Our expectation is for the excess inventory in the semiconductor supply chain to take a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level. We believe the current semiconductor cycle will be more similar to a typical cycle, with a few quarters of inventory adjustment likely through the first half of 2023. We have also internally modeled and prepared ourselves for various different scenarios in case it is necessary. On the demand side, while we observe softness in the consumer end market segment, the end market segments such as data center and automotive-related remain steady. And we are able to reallocate our capacity to support these areas. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, our customers' demand continues to exceed our ability to supply. We expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 and our full year growth to be mid-30% in U.S. dollar terms. Three key factors supporting TSMC's strong structural demand are our technology leadership and differentiation, our strong portfolio in high-performance computing and our strategic relationship with customers. All of these factors are TSMC's strengths in the foundry industry. First, on technology leadership and differentiation, TSMC's technology position is much stronger today as compared to previous years. Looking ahead to 2023, we are working diligently to provide the industry most advanced technologies and making it available to all the product innovators with the successful ramp of N5, N4P, N4X and the upcoming ramp-up of N3, we will expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market. The macroeconomic uncertainty may persist into 2023. Our technology leadership will continue to advance and support our growth. Secondly, the massive structural increase in the demand for computation, underpinned by the industry megatrends, continues to fill a greater need for performance and energy-efficient computing, which require the use of leading-edge technologies. Through our comprehensive IP ecosystem and optimized process technology, we are able to address and capture the structural demand and build a strong portfolio in high-performance computing. We expect HPC to be the main engine of TSMC's long-term growth and the largest contributor in terms of our incremental revenue growth in the next several years. Third, our strategic relationship with our customers is long-term in nature, developed and built through many years of collaboration and investment to enable customer success in the high-end market. We continue to work closely with our customer on technology development, capacity planning and pricing to support their long-term demand and growth. With all these three differentiating factors, we expect our capacity utilization to remain healthy in 2023. And our business to be less volatile and more resilient, supported by the strong demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies. Now let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook. While macroeconomic headwinds bring near-term uncertainties that may persist, we believe the fundamental structural growth trajectory in the long-term semiconductor demand remains firmly in place. We continue to observe an increase in silicon content across many end devices, fueled by process technology migration and increased functionality. For example, the number of CPUs, GPUs and AI accelerators in the data center are increasing. 5G smartphones carry substantially higher silicon content compared to 4G smartphones. The amount of silicon content in today's cars continues to rise. While the device unit growth of many electronics devices may be flattish to low single-digit percentage range in the next several years, the silicon content growth will be higher, in the mid- to high single-digit percentage range and support the long-term structural semiconductor demand and increase our addressable wafer demand. TSMC's CapEx and capacity planning are always based on the long-term structural market demand profile, not near-term factors. We are working closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technology to support their growth. We will manage our business prudently through the near-term uncertainties, and we remain highly confident in our long-term growth outlook. With our technology leadership, manufacturing and capacity support, and customers' trust, TSMC is well-positioned to capture the strong multi-year growth from the favorable structural megatrends of 5G and HPC-related applications and deliver profitable growth for our shareholders. We reiterate our long-term revenue to be between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms. Next, let me talk about the tool delivery update. As a major player in the global semiconductor supply chain, TSMC works closely with all our tool suppliers to plan our CapEx and capacity in advance. However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes. As a result, we expect some of our CapEx this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on-site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery. We are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constraints issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for a certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity. We have been working closely with our customers for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in the second half of this fiscal year. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. N3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3, and volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, let me talk about the N2 status. Our N2 technology development is on track and progressing well to our expectation, with risk production scheduled in 2024 and volume production in 2025. After careful evaluation and extensive period of development, our 2-nanometer technology will adopt the narrow sea transistor structure to provide our customers with the best performance, cost, and technology maturity. N2 delivers full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing, with a 10% to 15% speed improvement at the same power or a 20% to 30% power improvement at the same speed and larger density of more than 20% increase compared with N3E. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced and will further extend our leadership position well into the future. This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention.",

I believe that in the coming years, we will continue to see revenue growth in the range of 15% to 20%, driven by the increase in dollar content. This aspect often poses a challenge for investors, as it's difficult for them to gauge how much of the growth is attributed to dollar content. For instance, out of the projected 15% to 20% growth over the next few years, can you clarify how much is from dollar content growth, how much stems from shipments, and how much is a result of improvements in average selling price or product mix?",

The first is, when I look at your full year guidance of 35% revenue growth, it looks like calendar 4Q or the December quarter is going to be sequentially down more than 10%. And that hasn't happened in a long time. So I'm kind of curious, how much of that is driven by demand versus FX?  And then the second question, a follow-up is, if I look at your CapEx run rate, the first half is running at about TWD 17 billion, which is below the lower end of your full year guidance. So I'm kind of curious, what are the tool delays that's causing the pushout of CapEx into next year? Is it like EUV? Is it like depth edge tools? Any color on that would be super helpful.

It seems like this year, we start to see a foundry price increase and a bit unusual for TSMC. And going into next year, it looks like there's some manifestation of further price increases. But at the same time, we're also seeing potentially inventory correction. So just trying to understand the pricing strategy itself, is this more of a reflection of perhaps the structural profitability for this cycle being different than the past?

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the fourth quarter. The third quarter revenue increased 14.8% sequentially in NT dollar, or 11.4% in US dollars, as our third quarter business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technology. Third quarter gross margin increased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 60.4%. Slightly ahead of our guidance, as we enjoyed a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts. Total operating expenses accounted for 9.8% of net revenue as compared to 10% in the previous quarter. Operating margin increased 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 50.6%, mainly due to better operating leverage. Overall, our third quarter EPS was NT$10.83, and ROE was 42.9%. Now, let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 28% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 26%. Advanced technologies, which are defined as 7-nanometer and below accounted for 54% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. Smartphone increased 25% quarter-over-quarter to account for 41% of our third quarter revenue. HPC increased 4% to account for 39%, IoT increased 33% to account for 10%. Automotive increased 15%, to account for 5% and DCE decreased 2% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of NT$1.5 trillion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by NT$38 billion, mainly due to the decrease of NT$116 billion in short-term loans, partially offset by the increase of NT$70 billion in accrual liabilities and others. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by NT$88 billion mainly as we raised NT$60 billion of corporate bonds during the quarter. Our financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 1 day to 36 days. Inventory days decreased five days to 90 days, primarily due to higher wafer shipment during the quarter. Now, let me make a few comments on cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about NT$413 billion in cash from operations, spent NT$266 billion in CapEx, distributed NT$71 billion in fourth quarter '21 cash dividends and raised NT$60 billion from corporate bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased by NT$43 billion to NT$1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter. In US dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled NT$8.75 billion. I have finished my financial summary, now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between $19.9 billion and $20.7 billion US, which represents a 0.4% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to NT$31.5. Gross margin is expected to be between 59.5% and 61.5%, operating margin between 49% and 51%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now, let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our third quarter and fourth quarter profitability. Compared to the second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 130 basis points sequentially to 60.4% mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts, despite continued inflationary cost pressures. Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago, as our guidance was based on exchange rate assumption of $1 to NT$29.7, whereas the actual third quarter exchange rate was $1 to NT$30.32. This created about an 80 basis point difference in our actual third quarter gross margin versus our original guidance. We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to be flat sequentially at 60.5% at the midpoint, as a more favorable exchange rate assumption will be offset by lower capacity utilization rates. As a reminder, six factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership technology development and ramp up, pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix, and foreign exchange rate. Looking ahead to 2023, we face challenges from entry ramp dilution, a higher year-over-year increase in depreciation cost, rising inflationary cost, semiconductor cyclicality, and overseas fab expansions. To manage our profitability in 2023, we are working closely with our customers to support their growth and continue to strategically and consistently sell our value. We are also working diligently on our internal cost improvements. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, which we have no control over and taking the other five factors into consideration, we believe a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2022 CapEx. As I have stated before, every year our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Three months ago, we said our 2022 CapEx will be closer to the lower end of our $40 billion to $44 billion range. Now, we are further tightening up this year's capital spending and expect our 2022 CapEx to be around $36 billion. About half of the change is due to capacity optimization based on the current medium-term outlook. And the other half is still to continue dealing with challenges. Out of the around $36 billion CapEx for 2022, between 70% to 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies. Looking ahead, we will continue to manage our business prudently given the near-term uncertainties and adjust and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customer growth remains unchanged. And our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term structure and market demand profile. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders.

          "content": "Good afternoon everyone. First, let me start with TSMC's more resilient near-term demand outlook. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of NT$613.1 billion or US dollar $20.2 billion, supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5-nanometer technologies. Moving into fourth quarter 2022, we expect our business to be flat, as customers' ongoing inventory adjustment is balanced by the continued ramp-up of our 5-nanometer technologies supported by smartphone and HPC applications. We expect our full-year gross margin in 2022 to be in the mid-30% in US dollar terms. On the demand side, we continue to observe softness in the consumer end market segment. Other end market segments such as data center and automotive-related remain steady for now for TSMC. However, we are beginning to see the possibility of adjustments unfold. On the inventory side, our customers and the supply chain continue to take action to adjust their inventory. We expect the semiconductor supply chain inventory to peak in the third quarter this year and start to reduce in the fourth quarter this year. We also expect it will take a few quarters, through the first half of 2023, to rebalance to a healthier level. While the ongoing inventory correction will also affect TSMC, we expect our business to be less volatile and more resilient than the overall semiconductor industry during this period. This is supported by three key factors that are TSMC's advantages in the foundry industry. First, our technology leadership and differentiation are much stronger today compared to previous years. This allows TSMC to win business and enables our customers to have success in high-end markets, despite semiconductor cyclicality. Second, through our comprehensive design ecosystem and optimized process technologies, we are able to address and capture the structural increase in demand for computation and build a strong portfolio in high-performance computing. Third, our strategic relationships with our customers are long-term in nature, and we continue to work closely with our customers on technology development, capacity planning, and pricing to support their long-term demand and growth. As a result, we continue to see strong demand for our leading node except N7 and steady demand for our differentiated specialty technologies and mature nodes. Looking ahead to 2023, with the successful ramp-up of N5, N4P, N4X, and the upcoming ramp of N3, we will continue to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market. While the ongoing semiconductor inventory correction will affect the utilization rate in the first half of 2023, we expect our business to be supported by stronger demand for our differentiated and leading advanced and specialty technologies, making 2023 a growth year for TSMC. Next, let me discuss the N7 and N6 demand outlook. Due to end market weakness in smartphones and PCs, along with customer product schedule delays starting in the fourth quarter this year, our N7 and N6 capacity utilization will not be as high as it has been in the past three years. We expect this to persist for a few quarters through the first half of 2023 as the semiconductor supply chain inventory takes a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level, and we have adjusted our N7 and N6 CapEx accordingly. We believe the N7 and N6 demand is more of a cyclical issue rather than structural, and we expect our N7 and N6 demand to pick up in the second half of 2023. Longer-term, we continue to work closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technology and are confident we will drive an additional wave of structural demand to backfill our N7 and N6 capacity over the next several years. The 7-nanometer family will continue to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Now I will talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our N3 is on track for volume production later this quarter with good yield. We expect a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. Our customers' demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply partially due to ongoing tool delivery issues, and we expect N3 to be fully utilized in 2023. We expect N3 revenue in 2023 to be higher than N5 revenue in its first year in 2020 and for N3E to contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our wafer revenue in 2023, as our overall revenue base is much larger today than in 2020. N3E will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power, and yield, and offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. N3E development is progressing ahead of plan, and volume production is now scheduled for the second half of 2023. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we observe a high level of customer engagement at both N3 and N3E with the number of tape-outs more than double that of N5 in its first and second year. Thus, we are working closely with our tool suppliers to address delivery challenges and prepare more 3-nanometer capacity to support our customers\u2019 strong demand in 2023, 2024, and beyond. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both performance and transistor technology when it is introduced. We are confident that the N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, let me talk about the future drivers of leading node adoption. TSMC's ambition is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. Our job is to help our customers unleash their innovations and enable them to capture greater value and win in their end markets. As the industry continues to pursue scaling, it is true that technology shrink is slowing down and becoming more challenging for everyone due to rising process complexity. However, it is also true that demand for energy-efficient computing is accelerating in an intelligent and connected world, as technology becomes more pervasive and essential in people's lives. The semiconductor industry value in the supply chain is increasing, and the value of technology platform is expanding beyond the scope of geometry shrink alone and is increasingly focused on greater power efficiency. As a result, our customers value much more than simply transistor cost. System performance and power efficiency have become key motivations for customers who adopt our leading node technologies. By working closely with our customers on technology development, our N3 and N2 will deliver full node strides in performance and power benefits while offering the industry's most advanced transistor scaling. We expect strong demand for our leading node technologies driven by both smartphone and HPC applications to fuel our long-term revenue growth of 15% to 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms. With our leadership in both leading-edge process technology and 3D solutions, TSMC's technology cadence remains constant, delivering the value of our technology platform. We will continue to extend our overall competitiveness and technology leadership while delivering a predictable technology cadence that helps our customers to enhance their product competitiveness and grow their market well into the future. This concludes our key message, and thank you for your attention.",

And I think last time we saw, this was for 28-nanometer, but that lasted for a much longer period of time. So could you also give us some kind of comparison with what happened back in 28-nanometer and why this is going to be very different?

So with higher costs, if they want to buy from the U.S. or buy from Europe, can we charge a higher pricing if that's based on the node?

Please understand that each year, there is new depreciation being added, as well as depreciation coming off the table. So what you're looking at is the net result.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2022. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter 2023. First quarter revenue decreased 1.5% sequentially in U.S. dollar terms as our business was dampened by end market demand softness and customers\u2019 inventory adjustment despite the continued ramp-up of our industry-leading 5-nanometer technologies. It is at the low end of our previous guidance. In NT dollar terms, revenue increased 2% in the fourth quarter due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Gross margin increased 1.8 percentage points sequentially to 62.2% mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate and cost improvement efforts, partially offset by lower capacity utilization. Total operating expenses accounted for 10.3% of net revenue. Operating margin was 52%, up 1.4 percentage points from the previous quarter. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was TWD11.41 and ROE was 41.7%. Now, let\u2019s move on to the revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 32% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter while 7-nanometer accounted for 22%. Advanced Technologies defined as 7-nanometer and below accounted for 54% of wafer revenue. On a full year basis, 5-nanometer technology contributed 26% of 2022 wafer revenue. 7-nanometer was 27%. Advanced Technologies accounted for 53% of total wafer revenue, up from 50% in 2021. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 10% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 4% to account for 38%, IoT decreased 11% to account for 8%, automotive increased 10% to account for 6%, and DCE decreased 23% to account for 2%. On a full year basis, all 6 platforms had year-on-year growth. HPC increased 59% year-on-year to account for 41% of our 2022 revenue. Smartphone increased 28% to account for 39%, IoT increased 47% to account for 9%, automotive increased 74% to account for 5%, and DCE increased 1% to account for 3%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD1.56 trillion or $51 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD137 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD48 billion in accounts payable, an increase of TWD93 billion in accrued liabilities and others. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remain at 36 days while days of inventory increased 3 days to 93 days. Regarding cash flow and CapEx, during the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD487 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD337 billion in CapEx, and distributed TWD71 billion for first quarter 2022 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD47 billion to TWD1.34 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures totaled $10.82 billion. To recap our performance in 2022, we had strong growth in 2022 as our technology leadership position enabled us to capture the industry\u2019s megatrends of 5G and HPC. Our revenue increased 33.5% in U.S. dollar terms to reach $76 billion and 42.6% in NT terms to reach TWD2.26 trillion. Gross margin increased 8 percentage points to 59.6%, mainly reflecting a more favorable foreign exchange rate, value-selling efforts and cost improvement, partially offset by lower capacity utilization. Thanks to better operating leverage, operating margin increased 8.6 percentage points to 49.5%. Overall, full-year EPS increased 70.4% to TWD39.2 and ROE was 39.8%. On cash flow, we spent $36.3 billion or TWD1.1 trillion in CapEx. We generated TWD1.6 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD528 billion in free cash flow. We also paid TWD285 billion in cash dividends in 2022, up from TWD266 billion in 2021. I have finished my financial summary. Now, let\u2019s turn to our current quarter guidance. As overall macroeconomic conditions remain weak, we expect our business to be further impacted by continued end market demand softness and customers\u2019 further inventory adjustment. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between $16.7 billion and $17.5 billion, representing a 14.2% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD30.7, gross margin is expected to be between 53.5% and 55.5%, operating margin between 41.5% and 43.5%. Starting in 2023, certain tax exemptions from the Taiwan government have expired. However, the government has recently passed the amendments to the statute for industrial innovations. All things considered, we expect our effective tax rate in 2023 and beyond to be approximately 15%. This concludes my financial presentation.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our 2023 outlook. Concluding 2022, the semiconductor industry growth excluding memory was about 10%, while foundry industry increased about 27% year-over-year. TSMC\u2019s revenue grew $33.5 million year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms. Our business was supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation, even as our semiconductor inventory correction began to dampen the momentum in the second half of 2022. Entering 2023, we continue to observe softness in the consumer end market segment, while other end market segments such as data center related have softened as well. As customers and the supply chain continue to take action, we forecast a semiconductor supply chain inventory will be reduced sharply through the first half of 2023 to rebalance to a healthier level. In the first half of 2023, we expect our revenue to decline mid to high single-digit percent over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms. Having said that, we also start to observe some initial signs of demand stabilization, and we will watch closely for more signals. We forecast the semiconductor cycle to bottom sometime in the first half of 2023 and to see a healthy recovery in the second half this year. In the second half of 2023, we expect our revenue to increase over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms. For the full year of 2023, we forecast the semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline approximately 4%, while the foundry industry is forecast to decline 3%. For TSMC, supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we will continue to expand our customer product portfolio and increase our addressable market, and we expect 2023 to be a slight growth year for TSMC in U.S. dollar terms. Next, let me talk about the N7, N6 demand outlook. Three months ago, we set our N7, N6 capacity utilization in the first half of \u201823 will not be as high as it has been in the past 3 years due to end market weakness in smartphones and PCs and customer\u2019s product schedule delay. Since then, the end market demand for smartphones and PCs has further weakened and the capacity utilization of N7, N6 is lower than our expectation from 3 months ago. We expect this to persist through the first half of \u201823 as our semiconductor supply chain inventory takes a few quarters to rebalance to a healthier level, and we expect a mild pickup in our N7, N6 demand in the second half of 2023 than our prior expectation. However, we continue to believe N7, N6 demand is more of a cyclical issue rather than structural. We are working closely with our customers to develop specialty and differentiated technologies to drive an additional wave of structural demand from consumer, RF, connectivity, and other applications to backfill our N7, N6 capacity over the next several years. Thus, we are confident our 7-nanometer family will continue to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Now, I will talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our N3 has successfully entered volume production in late fourth quarter last year as planned with good yield. We expect a smooth ramp in 2023 driven by both HPC and smartphone applications. As our customers\u2019 demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply, we expect the N3 to be fully utilized in 2023. Sizable N3 revenue contribution, we expect to start in the third quarter of \u201823, and N3 will contribute mid single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023. We expect the N3 revenue in 2023 to be higher than N5 revenue in its fourth year in 2020. N3E will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power, and yield and offer complete platform support for both smartphones and HPC applications. Volume production is scheduled for the second half of \u201823. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we continue to observe a high level of customer engagement at both the N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than 2x that of N5 in its first and second years. Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA (Power Performance Area) and transistor technology, thus, we expect strong demand from customers in 2023, 2024, 2025, and beyond for our 3-nanometer technologies and are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, let me talk about our plans to expand TSMC\u2019s global manufacturing footprint to increase customers\u2019 trust and expand our future growth potential. TSMC's submission is to be a trusted technology and capacity provider for the global IC and logic IC industry for years to come. Our job is to provide the optimal solutions for our customers to enable their success, including technology leadership, manufacturing, cost, trust, and more recently, also geographic manufacturing flexibility. Based on customers\u2019 request, we are increasing our capacity outside of Taiwan to continue providing our customers with the optimal solution they need to be successful. TSMC\u2019s decisions are based on our customers\u2019 need and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize value for our shareholders. Our decisions are also based on the talent pool, land, electricity, and water needs for TSMC\u2019s long-term growth. In the U.S., we are in the process of building two advanced semiconductor fabs in Arizona. Our U.S. customers welcome us to build capacity in the U.S. to support their needs and have placed their strong commitment and support. We had an opening ceremony on December 6 last year to celebrate the arrival of the fourth batch of state-of-the-art semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and Fab 1 is on track to begin production of N4 process technology in 2024. We also announced the construction of a second fab which is scheduled to begin production of 3-nanometer process technology in 2026. TSMC Arizona will continue to provide the most advanced semiconductor technology commercially available in the U.S., enabling next-generation, high-performance and low-power computing products in the coming years. Each of our fabs will have a clean-room area that is approximately double the size of a typical logic fab. We will also consider building additional mature node capacity outside of Taiwan. In Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab, which will utilize 12 and 16-nanometer and 22, 28-process technologies. Volume production is scheduled for late 2024. We are also considering building a second fab in Japan as long as the demand from customers and the level of government support makes sense. In Europe, we are engaging with customers and partners to evaluate the possibility of building a specialty fab focusing on automotive-specific technologies based on the demand from customers and the level of government support. In China, we expand 28-nanometer in Nanjing as planned to support local customers, and we continue to follow all the rules and regulations fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and expand our capacity to support our customer\u2019s growth. Our N3 has just entered volume production in Tainan Science Park. We are also preparing for N2 volume production starting in 2025, which will be located in Chengdu and Taichung Science Park. While capacity does not come overnight and takes time to build, we are committed to expanding our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust and expand our future growth potential. Depending on the demand from customers and the level of government support, our 28-nanometer and below overseas capacity could be 20% or more of our total 28 and below capacity in 5 years or more time. While the initial cost of overseas fabs is higher than TSMC's fabs in Taiwan, our goal is to minimize the cost gap. Our pricing will remain strategic to reflect our value, which also includes the value of geographic flexibility. At the same time, we are leveraging our competitive advantage of lost volume, economies of scale, and manufacturing technology leadership to continuously drive costs down. We will also continue to work closely with our government to secure their support. By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher costs of overseas fabs while remaining the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer, no matter where we operate. Even as we increase our capacity outside of Taiwan, we believe the long-term gross margin of 53% and higher continues to be achievable, and we can earn a sustainable and healthy ROE of greater than 25%, while delivering profitable growth for our shareholders. This concludes our key messages. Thank you for your attention.",

I wanted to ask the first question just about the rising investment costs and also the cost differential with the U.S. Just based on the two press releases, the Taiwan fab, you cited Fab 18, about $60 billion investment for eight phases, which would be, I estimate about 200,000 capacity, that\u2019s about $300 million per thousand wafer. The Arizona fab was $40 billion for about 50,000, $800 million per thousand wafers. So, just two questions on it. If you could maybe discuss a bit more if there is differences in those releases on the investment in calculation and a bit more color on the relative costs since you did the U.S. expansion? And then the second part of the question is, is the cost seeing a significant acceleration? It\u2019s been rising with each new node.

Randy, if I got you correctly, basically what Randy is asking is, what is the cost in the U.S. seem much higher in terms of the investment?

We\u2019re not able to share with you a specific cost gap number between Taiwan and U.S., but we can share with you that the major reason for the cost gap is the construction cost of buildings and facilities, which can be 4 to 5x greater for U.S. fab versus a fab in Taiwan. The high cost of construction includes labor cost, cost of permits, cost of occupational safety and health regulations, inflationary costs in recent years, and people and learning curve costs.

Or is it some now expanding R&D into new geographic areas?

The other thing about tax in 2023, part of the tax exemptions or incentives in Taiwan have expired.

And that happened to correct \u2013 or let me say that inventory correct happened to be the most severe one. And so the end market dropped most severely generally thought. In fact, the unit will not increase, but the content will be increased, so is demand be more softened than we thought 3 months ago? Why be repeated at 5 or 3? Cyclicality of the semiconductor always exists, but it\u2019s unlikely this time the scenario was to be repeated because our current downturn actually, it\u2019s kind of being enhanced or being degraded by the pandemic. Due to the pandemic, the digital transformation progress has been enhanced. And so the demand being increased dramatically. But then due to the pandemic, the supply chain disruption happened. And people during this time, probably changed their strategy or their thoughts on the inventory buildup. So artificially, the inventory has been built up quickly and dramatically. And then the response to the each industry are different. And so they manage the inventory correction also differently. This kind of phenomenon all because of \u2013 largely because of the pandemic, and we don\u2019t think that it will happen again.

Now we\u2019ve given the guidance for this year, so you can calculate the capital intensity. It will be over 40%.

That\u2019s my answer to your first follow-up question. And whether that some kind of customer, some of the hyperscale customers want to develop their own chip. Yes, but I cannot give you more information than that.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the first quarter 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter 2023. First quarter revenue decreased 18.7% sequentially in NT or 16.1% in U.S. dollars as our first quarter business was impacted by weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand, which led customers to adjust their demand accordingly. Gross margin decreased 5.9 percentage points sequentially to 56.3%, mainly reflecting lower capacity utilization and a less favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by stricter cost controls. Total operating expenses accounted for 10.8% of net revenue, which is lower than the 12% implied in our first quarter guidance, mainly due to stringent expense control and lower employee profit sharing. Operating margin was 45.5%, down 6.5 percentage points from the previous quarter. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD 7.98 and ROE was 27.5%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 5-nanometer process technology contributed 31% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, while 7-nanometer accounted for 20%. Advanced Technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 51% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC declined 14% quarter-over-quarter and accounted for 44% of our first quarter revenue. Smartphone declined 27% to account for 34%. IoT declined 19% to account for 9%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 7%, and DCE decreased 5% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 1.59 trillion or USD 52 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by TWD 71 billion, mainly due to the decrease of TWD 65 billion in accounts payable. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 34 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 96 days. Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD 385 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 302 billion in CapEx, and distributed TWD 71 billion for the second quarter 2022 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 42 billion to TWD 1.39 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $9.94 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the second quarter to continue to be impacted by customers' further inventory adjustment. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 15.2 billion and USD 16 billion, which represents a 6.7% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 30.4, gross margin is expected to be between 52% and 54%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our first quarter '23 and second quarter '23 profitability. Compared to the fourth quarter, our first quarter gross margin decreased by 590 basis points sequentially to 56.3%, primarily due to a lower capacity utilization. Compared to our first quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago by 80 basis points, mainly due to more stringent cost control efforts. We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to be 53% at the midpoint, mainly due to a lower capacity utilization rate and higher electricity costs in Taiwan. After last year's electricity price increase of 15% in the second half of 2022, TSMC's electricity price in Taiwan has increased by another 17% starting April 1 this year. This is expected to take out 60 basis points from our second quarter gross margin. We expect the impact from higher electricity costs to continue throughout the second half of this year and dilute our full-year gross margin by about 50 basis points. In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of N3, overseas fab expansion, and inflationary costs, including higher utility costs in Taiwan. To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, over which we have no control, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about the 2023 capital budget. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As I've stated before, given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten our capital spending where appropriate. That said, our commitment to support customers' structural growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile. Thus we expect our 2023 capital budget to be between USD 32 billion and USD 36 billion. With this level of CapEx spending in 2023, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend on both an annual and quarterly basis. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge and specialty technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. Three months ago, we said we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to start gradually reducing in Q4 2022, and we forecast a sharper reduction throughout the first half of 2023. However, due to weakening macroeconomic conditions and softening end market demand, fabless semiconductor inventory continued to increase in the fourth quarter and exited 2022 at a much higher level than we expected. In addition, the recovery in end market demand from channels reopening is also lower than our expectation. Therefore, the fabless semiconductor inventory adjustment in the first half of '23 is taking longer than our prior expectation. It may extend into the third quarter this year before rebalancing to a healthier level. For the full year of 2023, we do our forecast for the semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline mid-single-digit percent, while the foundry industry is forecast to decline high single-digit percent. We now expect our full-year 2023 revenue to decline low to mid-single-digit percent in U.S. dollar terms, and our business to do better than both semiconductor ex-memory and foundry industries, supported by our strong technology leadership and differentiation. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of USD 6.7 billion, which is towards the low end of our guidance range, provided in U.S. dollar terms. Moving into the second quarter 2023, we expect our business to continue to be impacted by customers for the inventory adjustment. We now expect our revenue in the first half of 2023 to decline by about 10% over the same period last year in U.S. dollar terms as compared to mid- to high single-digit percent decline previously. Having said that, we believe we are passing through the bottom of the cycle of TSMC's business in the second quarter. While we forecast only a gradual recovery for the semiconductor ex-memory industry in the second half of 2023, TSMC's business in the second half of this year is expected to be stronger than the first half, supported by customers' new product launches. Next, let me talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our 3-nanometer technology is the first in the semiconductor industry to high-volume production with good yield. As our customers' demand for N3 exceeds our ability to supply, we expect N3 to be fully utilized in 2023, supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. Sizable N3 revenue contribution is expected to start in the third quarter, and N3 will contribute mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023. N3 will further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power, and yield, and offer complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3E has passed the qualification and achieved performance and yield targets, and volume production is scheduled for the second half of '23. Despite the ongoing inventory correction, we continue to observe a high level of customer engagement with both N3 and N3E with a number of tape-outs more than 2x that of N5 in the first and second half of the year. Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. Thus, we expect strong multi-yield demand for our N3 technologies and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Now I will talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 transistor structure provides our customers with the best performance, cost, and technology maturity. Our nanosheet technology has demonstrated excellent power efficiency, and our N2 will deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. At N2, we are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement from both HPC and smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced and will further extend our technology leadership well into the future. Finally, I will talk about TSMC's global footprint and talent development status. As we have said before, we are expanding our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust, expand our future growth potential, and reach for more global talents. In Arizona, despite some challenges in obtaining permits, our fourth fab is scheduled to begin production of N4 processing technology in late 2024. In Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab, and the volume production is scheduled for late 2024. In Europe, we are engaging with customers and partners to evaluate the possibility of building a specialty fab focusing on automotive-specific technologies based on the demand from customers and level of government support. In China, we are expanding 28-nanometer in Nanjing as planned to support our customer in China, and we continue to follow all rules and regulations fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and expand our capacity to support our customers' growth. In Kaohsiung, our fab construction continues, but we have adjusted our previous 28-nanometer expansion plan to now focus on capacity expansion for more advanced nodes, and we will remain flexible going forward. In terms of talent development, a key to TSMC's success is adherence to our core value of integrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust and our discipline and spirit of working together as one team. In both the U.S. and Japan, we are recruiting from the top local colleges and universities, and our progress is well on track. We have hired more than 900 U.S. employees today in Arizona and more than 370 in Japan. We also plan to hire more than 6,000 employees in Taiwan in 2023. All of our hirings are to support our future growth potential. In addition to providing an extensive training program for new overseas employees, many of them are brought to Taiwan for hands-on experience in our fabs so that they can further their technical skills while being immersed in TSMC's operational environment and culture. As we expand our global footprint, our priority will continue to be identifying, attracting, and hiring talent whose core values and principles are aligned with TSMC's so that we can establish TSMC culture in all our employees, no matter where we operate. This concludes our key message. Thank you for your attention.",

How does TSMC see this competitive threat? And how do you benchmark TSMC N3 and N2, which is coming in 2025 with Intel's offerings over the next, let's say, 2 to 3 years? And maybe I think TSMC has not commented about foundry market share for quite some time.

Whether this one has been included in our previous announcement that said that we have a 15% to 20% CAGR, the answer is probably partially yes, because for servers we have accelerated into our consideration.

During times of high capital intensity or investment, the focus leans more towards sustainability. However, once we start to realize the benefits of our capital investments, our focus shifts towards consistent growth. The 70% ratio serves as a guideline. For instance, if a certain year sees significantly lower free cash flow due to increased capital expenditures or lower profits, we may opt to distribute a higher proportion of cash flow to uphold a sustainable dividend. Conversely, in a year with particularly strong free cash flow, while the ratio might be 70%, it could also be lower as we need to consider future prospects and ensure sustainability.

Do you have plans for potential reuse of 5-nanometer in the next 1 to 2 years as you bring up more of the 3-nanometer? And then the second part of the question, I wanted to ask more on that Kaohsiung fab shift. If you could go through why the plan to pull back on 28. And then with the intention for where you would shift that investment. Because I know you did cancel the 7-nanometer for that line.

You asked whether we are converting some of the N5's capacity to N3, especially since we currently have insufficient support for our customers in N3. Instead of converting N5 capacity directly to N3, I want to clarify that we have established a strategy and methodology to allow some N3 tools to be supported by N5. This flexibility is crucial for us to meet our commitments to customers in N3, even though it isn't completely sufficient yet. Now, addressing the second part of your question regarding Kaohsiung's total addressable market, we are considering the market situation and initially focusing on the high demand for 28 nanometers, which warrants including Kaohsiung in our plans. However, the market is very dynamic, and we have a plan in Japan to build a new fab for specialty 28 nanometers. TSMC has expanded capacity related to mature nodes and specialties, but we are not increasing capacity purely for logic applications to prevent overcapacity. In addition to Japan, we are also expanding our 28-nanometer capacity in Nanjing and exploring opportunities in Europe for automotive applications. When combining all three, we believe that building the 28-nanometer capacity in Kaohsiung may not be financially feasible at this time. Therefore, we have decided to adjust our focus towards more advanced nodes, for which we still see a shortage. Kaohsiung's proximity to Tainan allows for greater flexibility between the two locations. I hope that answers your question.",

At this moment, we believe this range is appropriate and prudent under today's economic environment; that range is still valid. Now for next year, it's too early to talk about next year.

You put money in, but you are not harvesting that investment yet. But there's no revenue dollars being generated. But now I think you said you're tightening the CapEx for 2023, but you're reiterating that $32 billion to $36 billion CapEx. That seems to be adding on top of that $40 billion. A lot more investment is still expected in this year. So my question really is about this. Are you expecting a significantly higher incremental revenue opportunity in 2024 and beyond to justify that $40 billion plus, maybe another $32 billion investment?

Second quarter revenue decreased 5.5% sequentially in NT or 6.2% in U.S. dollars as our second quarter business was impacted by overall global economic conditions, which dampened end market demand and led to customers' ongoing inventory adjustments. Gross margin decreased 2.2 percentage points sequentially to 54.1%, mainly reflecting lower capacity utilization and higher electricity costs, partially offset by more stringent cost control and a more favorable foreign exchange rate. Despite the industry's cyclical downturn, we continue to invest in R&D to support our N3 and N2 development. Thus, operating margin was 42%, down 3.5 percentage points sequentially. Overall, our first quarter EPS was NT7.01 and ROE was 23.2%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. The 5-nanometer process technology contributed 30% of our wafer revenue in the second quarter, while the 7-nanometer accounted for 23%. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 53% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC decreased 5% quarter-over-quarter to account for 44% of our second quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 9% to account for 33%. IoT decreased 11% to account for 8%. Automotive increased 3% to account for 8%, and DCE increased 25% to account for 3%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of NT1.5 trillion or USD 48 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities decreased by NT62 billion, mainly due to the net decrease of NT87 billion in income tax payable as we pay NT120 billion for 2022 income tax, offset by NT33 billion accrued tax payables for the second quarter. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by NT53 billion mainly as we raised NT41 billion in corporate bonds. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased 2 days to 32 days, while days of inventory increased 3 days to 99 days, primarily due to entry ramp during the quarter. Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the second quarter, we generated about NT167 billion in cash from operations, spent NT251 billion in CapEx, distributed NT71 billion for the third quarter 2022 cash dividend, and raised NT41 billion from corporate bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance decreased by NT109 billion to NT1.3 trillion at the end of the quarter. Free cash flow was negative NT83 billion during the quarter as operating cash flow was more than offset by capital expenditures, partly due to the income tax payment of NT120 billion. In U.S. dollar terms, our second quarter capital expenditures totaled NT8.17 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between NT16.7 billion and USD 17.5 billion, which represents a 9.1% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to NT30.8, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin to be between 38% and 40%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our second quarter \u201923 and third quarter \u201923 profitability. Compared to the first quarter, our second quarter gross margin decreased by 220 basis points sequentially to 54.1%, primarily due to lower capacity utilization. Compared to our second quarter guidance, our actual gross margin slightly exceeded the high end of the range provided 3 months ago, mainly due to more stringent cost control efforts and a slightly more favorable foreign exchange rate. We have just guided our third quarter gross margin to decline by 1.6 percentage points to 52.5% at the midpoint, primarily as the higher level of capacity utilization rate is offset by 2 to 3 percentage points margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect the continued steep ramp-up of our 3-nanometer to dilute our fourth quarter gross margin by about 3 to 4 percentage points. In 2023, our gross margin faces challenges from lower capacity utilization due to semiconductor cyclicality, the ramp-up of N3, overseas fab expansion, and inflationary costs, including higher utility costs in Taiwan. To manage our profitability in 2023, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. While we face near-term challenges, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2023 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and tighten up our capital spending where appropriate. We now expect our 2023 capital budget to be towards the lower end of our range of between USD 32 billion and USD 36 billion. Our depreciation expense is now expected to increase by mid-20s percent year-over-year in 2023, mainly as we ramp our 3-nanometer technologies. Despite near-term inventory cycles, our commitment to support customers' structural growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remains based on the long-term market demand profile. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. Now let me make a few comments on our cash dividend distribution policy. The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility, and distribute a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend to shareholders. As a result of our rigorous capital management, in May, TSMC Board of Directors approved the distribution of NT3 per share cash dividend for the first quarter of 2023, up from NT2.75 previously. This will become the new minimum quarterly dividend level going forward. The first quarter \u201923 cash dividend will be distributed in October 2023. For 2023, TSMC shareholders will receive a total of NT11.25 per share dividend and at least NT12 per share cash dividend for 2024. Going forward, as our capital intensity begins to decline in the next several years, the focus of our cash dividend policy is expected to shift from a sustainable to a steadily increasing cash dividend per share in the next few years.

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our second quarter with revenue of USD 15.7 billion in line with our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the second quarter was impacted by the overall global economic conditions, which dampened end market demand and customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. Moving into third quarter 2023. While we have recently observed an increase in AI-related demand, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business. We expect our business in the third quarter to be supported by the strong ramp of our 3-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers continued inventory adjustment. In the last quarterly conference, we said we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to rebalance to a healthier level exiting the third quarter. This statement continues to hold true. However, due to persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions, slower-than-expected demand recovery in China, and overall softer end market demand conditions, customers are more cautious and intend to further control their inventory into 4Q '23. Thus, while we maintain our forecast for the 2023 semiconductor market, excluding memory, to decline mid-single-digit year-over-year, we now expect the foundry industry to decline mid-teens and our full year 2023 revenue to decline around 10% in U.S. dollar terms. With such inventory control, we also forecast the fabless semiconductor inventory to exit 4Q '23 at a healthier and lower level compared to our expectation 3 months ago. Next, let me talk about the HPC and TSMC's long-term growth outlook. As we have said before, the massive structural increase in demand for computation underpinned by the industry megatrend of 5G and HPC continues to drive a greater need for performance and energy-efficient computing, which require use of leading-edge technologies. These megatrends are expected to fill TSMC's long-term growth. Even with a more challenging 2023, our revenue remains well on track to grow between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms, which is a target we communicated back in January 2022 Investor Conference. The recent increase in AI-related demand is directionally positive for TSMC. Generative AI requires higher computing power and interconnect bandwidth, which drive increasing semiconductor content. With using CPUs, GPUs, or AI accelerators and related ASIC for AI and machine learning, the commonality is that it requires leading-edge technology and a strong foundry design ecosystem. These are all TSMC's strengths. Today, server AI processor demand, which we define as CPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators that are performing training functions, accounts for approximately 6% of TSMC's total revenue. We forecast this to grow at close to 50% CAGR in the next 5 years and increase to low teens percent of our revenue. The sensible need for energy-efficient computation is starting from data centers, and we expect it to proliferate to edge and devices over time, which will further drive long-term opportunities. We have already embedded a certain assumption for AI demand into our long-term CapEx and growth forecast. Our HPC platform is expected to be the main engine and the largest incremental contributor to TSMC's long-term growth in the next several years. While the quantification of the total addressable opportunity is still ongoing, generative AI and large language models only reinforce the already strong conviction we have in the structural mega trend to drive TSMC's long-term growth, and we will closely monitor the developments for further potential upside. Now let me talk about our N3 and N3E status. Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both performance, power, and transistor technology. N3 is already involved in production with good yield. We are seeing robust demand for N3, and we expect a strong ramp of N3 in the second half of this year, supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. N3 is expected to continue to contribute mid-single-digit percentage to our total wafer revenue in 2023. N3E further extends our N3 family with enhanced performance, power, and yield and provides complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3E has passed the qualification and achieved performance and yield targets and will start volume production in the fourth quarter of this year. With our continuous enhancement of 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multi-year demand from our customers and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, I'll talk about our N2 status. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 top nanosheet transistor structure will provide our customers with the best performance, cost, and technology maturity. Our nanosheet technology has demonstrated excellent power efficiency, and our N2 will deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. As part of the N2 technology platform, we also developed N2 with a backside power rail solution, which is best suited for HPC applications. Backside power rail will provide a 10% to 12% additional speed gain and a 10% to 15% larger density boost on top of the baseline technology. We are targeting the backside power rail to be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. We are observing a high level of customer interest and engagement at N2 from both HPC and smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced, and to further extend our technology leadership right into the future. This concludes my prepared remarks, and now let me turn the microphone over to Mark.",

          "content": "Thank you, C. C. And good afternoon, everyone. Today, I want to talk about TSMC's global manufacturing footprint, status update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. Our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust and to expand our future growth potential and to reach for more global talents. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs and the necessary level of government support. That is to maximize the value of our shareholders and to fulfill our fiduciary duty. In Arizona, we are building our first fab to provide the U.S. most advanced semiconductor technology in mass production to support the needs for U.S. semiconductor infrastructure. Our fab in Arizona started construction in April 2021 with an aggressive schedule. We are now entering a critical phase of handling and installing the most advanced and dedicated equipment. However, we are encountering certain challenges, as there is an insufficient amount of skilled workers with the specialized expertise required for equipment installation in a semiconductor-grade facility. While we are working to improve the situation, including sending experienced technicians from Taiwan to train the local skilled workers for a short period of time, we expect the production schedule of N4 process technology to be pushed out to 2025. In Japan, we are building a specialty technology factory, which will utilize 12, 16, and 22, 28 process technologies. Volume production is on track for late 2024. In Europe, we are engaging with customers and partners to evaluate building a specialty fab in Germany, focusing on automotive-specific technologies based on the demand from our customers and the level of government support. In China, we are expanding 28-nanometer in Nanjing as we planned to support our customer in China, and we continue to follow all rules and regulations fully. At the same time, we continue to invest in Taiwan and to expand our capacity to support our customers' growth. From a cost perspective, the initial cost of overseas fab is higher than TSMC's fabs in Taiwan due to: one, the smaller fab scale; two, higher costs throughout the supply chain; and three, the early stage of semiconductor ecosystem on those overseas sites, as compared to a matured ecosystem in Taiwan. In our recent meetings with senior government officials in the U.S., Japan, and Europe, we discussed our plans to expand our global manufacturing footprint with them. We also emphasized that one of our major responsibilities is to manage and minimize the cost gap to maximize return for our shareholders. Those discussions went very well. All sites understand the critical and integral role TSMC plays in the semiconductor industry, and we appreciate all the government's ongoing support in working with TSMC to help narrow down the cost gap. We will continue to work closely with all the governments to secure further support. Our pricing will also remain strategic to reflect our value, which includes the value of geographic flexibility. At the same time, we will leverage our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership, large volume, and economies of scale to continuously drive our costs down. By taking such actions, TSMC will have the ability to absorb the higher costs of overseas fab while remaining the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer no matter where we operate. Thus, even as we expand our capacity overseas, TSMC's long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE of greater than 25% is achievable, and we will continue to maximize the value for our shareholders. This concludes our key messages. Thank you for your attention.",

A lot of TSMC's customers have been talking about capacity shortage and having to kind of queue up for capacity for AI accelerators, including GPUs and ASICs. Could TSMC talk a little bit about what TSMC is doing on the capacity side, especially on the advanced packaging, but also on other areas? And when do you expect to get back to some degree of demand and supply balance for these AI accelerators? Is it going to be only sometime next year?

So we are working with customers for the short term to help them to fulfill the demand, but we are increasing our capacity as quickly as possible.

And so the end market demand actually did not grow as we expected. So put all together, even we have a very good AI processor demand, it is still not enough to offset all those kinds of macro impact.

As we said, under such situations, our customers are more cautious in their inventory control in the second half of this year. So while we expect the fabless semiconductor industry, their inventory to be cleaner and healthier existing this year, but we're much closer to the seasonal level.

We assume a certain percentage of the data center processor are AI processors. And based on that, we calculate the AI processor demand. And this model is yet to be fitted to the practical data later on. But in general, I think the - our trend of a big portion of data center processor will be AI processor is a sure thing. And we can cannibalize the data center processors. In the short term, when the CapEx of the cloud service provider are fixed, yes, it will. It is. But as for the long term, when their data service, when the cloud services having the generative AI service revenue, I think they will increase the CapEx, that should be consistent with the long-term AI processor demand.

But we're not giving our guidance on the fourth quarter at this moment. We're just spelling out some of the challenges that we're seeing.

For next year, we're seeing - we're not talking about the whole gross margin, but we still see that N3 will dilute about 3 to 4 percentage points of next year's gross margin.

A lot of my customers right now increase their demand, and that will increase their front end demand, of course. TSMC almost have the major share or the largest share, let me say that in the front end wafer. According to the front ends adopting, we really work closely with our customer and to decide what is the back end that they need. And so on that perspective, we are planning our cohorts capacity, although probably still not enough, but we're working very hard to increase it. Overcapacity, not today is a concern, that it is concerns, it's not enough capacity to support all the very strong demand.",

So I'm still - I'm wondering is still the case for N3.

If we look at 5, you reach towards 18% of revenue in the second year of mass production and then about 24% of revenue in the third year. Whereas for 3-nanometer, I think the concerns by smartphone customers have been on cost. Then the question will be if HPC is significant enough to still drive a meaningful pickup of 3-nanometer.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the third quarter 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the fourth quarter 2023. Third quarter revenue increased 13.7% sequentially in NT dollars or 10.2% in U.S. dollars as our third quarter business was supported by the strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology and higher demand for 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. Gross margin increased 0.2 percentage points sequentially to 54.3%, mainly reflecting higher capacity utilization, partially offset by the margin dilution from N3 ramp. Total operating expenses accounted for 12.6% of net revenue as compared to 12.1% in the second quarter, mainly due to higher R&D expenses to support our 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer development. Operating margin was 41.7%, down 0.3 percentage points from the previous quarter. Overall, our third quarter EPS was TWD8.14, and ROE was 25.8%. Now let's move on to the revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 6% of wafer revenue in the third quarter while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 37% and 16%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 59% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 6% quarter-over-quarter to account for 42% of our third quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 33% to account for 39%. IoT increased 24% to account for 9%. Automotive decreased 24% to account for 5%. And DCE decreased 1% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD1.55 trillion or US$48 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD159 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD95 billion in accounts payable and the increase of TWD59 billion in accrued liabilities and others. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD30 billion, of which TWD10 billion from new issuance and TWD20 billion from foreign exchange rate movement. On financial ratio, accounts receivable turnover days increased 3 days to 35 days while days of inventory decreased 3 days to 96 days. Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the third quarter, we generated about TWD295 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD227 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD71 billion for fourth quarter '22 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD35 billion to TWD1.31 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures totaled TWD7.1 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between TWD18.8 billion and US$19.6 billion, which represents an 11.1% sequential increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of US$1 to TWD32, gross margin is expected to be between 51.5% and 53.5%, operating margin between 39.5% and 41.5%. This concludes the financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our third quarter '23 and fourth quarter '23 profitability. Compared to second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 20 basis points sequentially to 54.3%, primarily due to a higher capacity utilization rate and a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by the margin dilution from the initial ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology. Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago by 80 basis points, mainly due to a more favorable foreign exchange rate. We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to decline by 1.8 percentage points to 52.5% at the midpoint, primarily due to the continued margin dilution from the steep ramp of our 3-nanometer technology. As a reminder, six factors determine TSMC's profitability: leadership, technology development and ramp-up pricing, cost reduction, capacity utilization, technology mix and foreign exchange rate. To manage our profitability in the next several years, we will work diligently on our internal cost improvement while continuing to strategically sell our value. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2023 CapEx and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. Given the near-term uncertainties, we continue to manage our business prudently and have tightened our capital spending throughout the year where appropriate. We now expect our 2023 CapEx to be approximately US$32 billion. Out of the approximately US$32 billion CapEx for 2023, about 70% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask-making, and others. Our depreciation expense is now expected to increase by low 20s percentage year-over-year in 2023, as compared to our January forecast of approximately 30% year-over-year increase. Despite the near-term inventory cycle, our commitment to support customers' growth remains unchanged, and our disciplined CapEx and capacity planning remain based on the long-term structure market demand profile. We will continue to work closely with our customers to plan our long-term capacity and invest in leading-edge specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support their growth while delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. Now let me turn the microphone over to C. C.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand and inventory. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of US$17.3 billion, in line with our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the third quarter was supported by the strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology and higher demand for 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by customers' ongoing inventory adjustment. Moving into the first quarter 2023, while AI-related demand continues to be strong, it is not enough to offset the overall cyclicality of our business. We expect our business in the fourth quarter to be supported by the continuing ramp of our 3-nanometer technology, partially offset by customers' continued inventory adjustment. On the inventory side, we expect the fabless semiconductor inventory to have continuously reduced in the third quarter. However, due to the persistent weaker overall macroeconomic conditions and slow demand recovery in China, customers remain cautious in their inventory control. Thus, we expect the inventory digestion to continue in the fourth quarter. Having said that, we are observing some early signs of demand stabilization in the PC and smartphone end markets. Together with such level of inventory control, we forecast the fabless semiconductor inventory to further reduce and exit Q4 '23 at a healthier level. Next, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. As we have said before, our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase customer trust, expand our future growth potential, and reach for more global talents. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs and the necessary level of government support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders. In Europe, after conducting extensive due diligence, we announced our plan to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial applications. We have received a strong commitment to support this project from our JV partners, the European Commission government, and German federal, state, and city governments. These fabs will utilize 22- and 28-nanometer and 12-, 16-nanometer technologies for semiconductor wafer fabrication. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2024, and production is targeted to begin in late 2027. In Arizona, we are receiving strong support from the city of Phoenix, State of Arizona, and U.S. federal government and continue to develop positive relationships and work closely with our local trade and union partners. We are making good progress on the fab infrastructure, utilities, and equipment installation issues in our first fab, and the situation is improving. We have also begun early preparation for our Arizona fab operations and hired close to 1,100 local TSMC employees so far. Many of them have been brought to Taiwan for extensive hands-on experience in our fab, so that they can further their technical fields, who are being immersed in TSMC operational environment and culture. We continue to target volume production of N4 process technology in the first half of 2025 and are confident that once we begin operations, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing, quality, and reliability in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan. In Japan, we built a specialty technology fab, which will utilize 12- and 16-nanometer and 22- and 28-nanometer process technologies. We have hired approximately 800 local TSMC employees so far, with the majority having been brought to Taiwan for hands-on experience. Equipment moving has begun this month, and volume production is on track for late 2024. In China, we have recently received an extension from the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security to continue our operation in Nanjing. We are currently in the process of applying for validated end-user authorization and expect to receive a prominent authorization in the near future. From a cost perspective, the initial cost of overseas fabs is higher than TSMC fab in Taiwan due to, first, smaller fab scale; second, higher costs throughout the supply chain; and third, the early stage of the semiconductor ecosystem overseas as compared to a matured ecosystem in Taiwan. TSMC's responsibility is to manage and minimize the cost gap to maximize the return for our shareholders. Our pricing will also remain strategic to reflect our value, which includes the value of geographic flexibility. We will also work closely with government to secure their support. At the same time, we are leveraging our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership, large volume economies of scale to continuously drive our cost down. By taking such actions, TSMC has the ability to absorb the higher cost of overseas fabs and still deliver the long-term gross margin of 53% and higher and sustainable ROE greater than 25%. We remain firm in our commitment to maximize the value for our shareholders. Now let me talk about N3 and N3E ramp-up and progress. Our 3-nanometer technology, the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology, is already in production with good yield, and we are seeing a strong ramp in the second half of this year supported by both HPC and smartphone applications. We reaffirm N3 will contribute a mid-single-digit percentage of our total wafer revenue in 2023, and we expect a much higher percentage in 2024 supported by robust demand from multiple customers. N3E will leverage the strong foundation of N3 to further extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power, and yield and provide complete platform support for both HPC and smartphone applications. N3E has passed qualification and achieved performance and yield targets and will start volume production in the fourth quarter of this year. We also continue to provide further enhancement of N3 technology, including N3P and N3X. With our strategy of continuous enhancement of our 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multi-yield demand from our customers, and we are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, I will talk about the N2 status. The recent surge in AI-related demand supports our already strong conviction that demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. The value of our technology platform is expanding beyond the scope of geometry scaling and increasing toward greater power efficiency. In addition, as process technology complexity increases, the lead time and engagement with customers also starts much earlier. As a result, we are observing a strong level of customer interest and engagement at our N2, similar to or higher than N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced in 2025. Our N2 technology development is progressing well and on track for volume production in 2025. Our N2 adopts a nanosheet transistor structure, which has demonstrated excellent power efficiency and will deliver full node performance and power benefits to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing. As part of the N2 technology platform, we also developed N2 with a backside power rail solution, which is best suited for HPC applications. We are targeting the backside power rail to be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivatives will further extend our technology leadership well into the future. This concludes our key messages, and thank you for your attention.",

Currently, it appears that automotive demand has shifted into an inventory adjustment phase in the latter half of 2023. However, we anticipate that automotive demand will rebound in 2024 due to the increasing number of electric vehicles and additional functionalities being integrated into automotive designs. As for the 7-nanometer technology, the low utilization and decrease in revenue have surpassed our original expectations. We anticipated higher utilization of the N7 technology at this point, but that hasn\u2019t happened. This has coincided with a significant drop in smartphone demand over the last decade, decreasing from about 1.4 billion units to approximately 1.1 billion units. This decline has affected N7 utilization, particularly due to a major customer delaying their product launch, which has contributed to the low utilization rate. Despite this, we are optimistic about filling our 7- and 6-nanometer capacity with additional specialty demand from consumer, RF, connectivity, and other applications, aiming to reach a healthy utilization level in the coming years. This situation is reminiscent of what we experienced with the 28-nanometer technology in 2018 and 2019 when it was also underutilized for a time. We collaborated with our customers and developers on specialty technologies, ultimately leading to an expansion of 28-nanometer specialty capacity. That experience reflects a similar trajectory here.

Secondly, the complexity of leading nodes is increasing. Additionally, unexpected inflation pressures in recent years have also added to the higher costs in N3. As a result, it will be quite challenging for future leading nodes to achieve the corporate margin within the same timeframe as before.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Happy New Year, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter and a recap of full year 2023. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2024. Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.4% sequentially in NT dollars, or 13.6% in U.S. dollars as our fourth quarter business was supported by the continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technology. Gross margin decreased 1.3 percentage points sequentially to 53%, primarily due to margin dilution from the 3-nanometer ramp. Operating margin decreased 0.1 percentage points sequentially to 41.6%, slightly ahead of our guidance, mainly due to operating leverage on higher revenue. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was NT$9.21 and ROE was 28.1%. Now let me move on to revenue by technology. The 3-nanometer process technology contributed 15% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter, while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 35% and 17% respectively. Advanced Technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue. On a full-year basis, 3-nanometer revenue contribution came in at 6% of 2023 wafer revenue. 5-nanometer was 33% and 7-nanometer was 19%. Advanced Technologies accounted for 58% of total wafer revenue, up from 53% in 2022. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform, HPC increased 17% quarter-over-quarter to account for 43% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 27% to account for 43%. IoT decreased 29% to account for 5%. Automotive increased 13% to account for 5% and DCE decreased 35% to account for 2%. On a full-year basis, Smartphone, IoT and DCE decreased 8%, 17%, and 16% respectively. HPC remained flat while automotive increased 15% in 2023. Overall, HPC accounted for 43% of our 2023 revenue. Smartphone accounted for 38%, IoT for 8%, and automotive for 6%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of NT$1.7 trillion or US$55 billion. On the liabilities side, current liabilities decreased by NT$56 billion mainly due to the decrease in accounts payable. On financial ratios, accounts receivable days decreased four days to 31 days while days of inventory also declined 11 days to 85 days, primarily due to a higher 3-nanometer wafer shipment. Regarding cash flow and CapEx, during the fourth quarter, we generated about NT$395 billion in cash from operations, spent NT$170 billion in CapEx, and distributed NT$78 billion for the first quarter 2023 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased NT$154 billion to NT$1.47 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our fourth-quarter capital expenditures totaled NT$5.24 billion. Now let's look at the recap of our performance in 2023. 2023 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry, but our technology leadership enabled TSMC to outperform the foundry industry. Our revenue decreased 8.7% in U.S. dollar terms to US$69 billion or decreased 4.5% in NT terms to NT$2.16 trillion. Gross margin decreased 5.2 percentage points to 54.4%, mainly reflecting lower overall capacity utilization and the 3-nanometer ramp, partially offset by a more favorable foreign exchange rate. To extend our technology leadership, we continued to expand our R&D investment in 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer development, despite a lower revenue base in 2023. Thus, operating margin decreased 6.9 percentage points to 42.6%. Overall, full-year EPS declined 17.5% to NT$32.34 and ROE was 26.2%. On cash flow, we spent US$30.45 billion or NT$950 billion in CapEx, while generating NT$1.7 trillion in operating cash flow and NT$292 billion in free cash flow. We also paid NT$292 billion in cash dividends in 2023. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the first quarter to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first-quarter revenue to be between US$18 billion and US$18.8 billion, which represents a 6.2% sequential decline at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of US$1 to NT$31.1, gross margin is expected to be between 52% and 54%. Operating margin between 40% and 42%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on our fourth quarter 2023 and first quarter 2024 profitability. Compared to the third quarter, our fourth quarter gross margin decreased by 130 basis points sequentially to 53%, primarily due to the margin dilution from the continued ramp-up of our 3-nanometer technology. We have just guided our first quarter gross margin to be flat sequentially at 53% at the midpoint, primarily as a less favorable foreign exchange rate assumption is offset by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality. Looking at full year 2024, given the six factors that determine our profitability, there are a few puts and takes I would like to share. On the plus side, we expect our utilization rate to rise in 2024 as our business recovers. However, as we move forward, as we have said before, the 3-nanometer is expected to dilute our gross margin by about 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points for the full year of 2024 as the revenue contribution will be much higher than in 2023. In addition, we have a strategy so that some of our N3 capacity can be supported by N5 tools, given the strong multiyear demand. Such a plan will enable higher capital efficiency in the mid to long-term but requires cost and effort in the near-term. Most of this conversion will occur in the second half of 2024 and we expect it to dilute our gross margin by about 1 percentage point to 2 percentage points in the second half of 2024. Finally, we have no control over the foreign exchange rate, but that may be another factor in 2024. Long-term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. In 2023, we spent US$30.4 billion lower than our prior guidance of approximately US$32 billion as we continued to tighten up our capital spending where appropriate given the near-term uncertainties. In 2024, our capital budget is expected to be between US$28 billion and US$32 billion as we continue to invest to support customers' growth. Out of the US$28 billion to US$32 billion CapEx for 2024, between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making, and others. Our depreciation expense is expected to increase close to 30% year-over-year in 2024, mainly as we ramp up our 3-nanometer technologies. Finally, let me make some comments on our long-term CapEx and cash dividend distribution policy. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years. In the past few years, we have sharply increased our CapEx spending in preparation to capture and harvest the growth opportunities from HPC, AI, and 5G megatrends. Despite a challenging 2023, our revenue remains well on track to grow between 15% and 20% CAGR over the next several years in U.S. dollar terms, which is the target we communicated back in January 2022 investor conference. With our 2024 CapEx guidance of US$28 billion to US$32 billion, the rate of increase of our capital spending has begun to level-off as we capture and harvest the growth. The objectives of TSMC's capital management are to fund the company's growth organically, generate good profitability, preserve financial flexibility, and distribute a sustainable and steadily increasing cash dividend to shareholders. As a result of our rigorous capital management, in November, TSMC's Board of Directors approved the distribution of a NT$3.5 per share cash dividend for the third quarter of 2023, up from NT$3 previously. This will become the new minimum quarterly dividend level going forward. Third quarter 2023 cash dividend will be distributed in April 2024. In 2023, TSMC's shareholders received a total of NT$11.25 cash dividend per share, and they will receive at least NT$13.5 per share cash dividend for 2024. In the next few years, we expect the focus of our cash dividend policy to continue to shift from a sustainable to a steadily increasing cash dividend per share.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our 2024 outlook. 2023 was a challenging year for the global semiconductor industry, but we also witnessed the rising emergence of generative AI-related applications, with TSMC as a key enabler. In 2023, weakening global macroeconomic conditions and high inflation and interest rates exaggerated and prolonged the global semiconductor inventory adjustment cycle. Concluding 2023, the semiconductor industry, excluding the memory industry, declined about 2%, while foundry industry declined about 13% year-over-year. TSMC's revenue declined 8.7% year-over-year in U.S. dollar terms. Despite the near-term challenges, our technology leadership enables TSMC to outperform the foundry industry in 2023 while we are positioning ourselves to capture the future AI and high-performance computing-related growth opportunities. Entering 2024, we forecast fabless semiconductor inventory to have returned to a higher level exceeding 2023. However, macroeconomic weakness and geopolitical uncertainties persist, potentially further weighing on consumer sentiment and end market demand. Having said that, our business has bottomed out on a year-over-year basis, and we expect 2024 to be a healthy growth year for TSMC, supported by the continued strong ramp of our industry-leading 3-nanometer technologies, strong demand for the 5-nanometer technologies, and robust AI-related demand. Coming off the steep inventory correction and low base of 2023. For the full year of 2024, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to increase by more than 10% year-over-year, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be approximately 20%. For TSMC, supported by our technology leadership and a broader customer base, we are confident to outperform the foundry industry growth. We expect our business to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout 2024 and our full-year revenue expects to increase by low-to-mid 20% in U.S. dollar terms. Next, let me talk about our N3 and N3E ramp-up and progress. Our 3-nanometer technology is the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology. As a result, almost all the world's smartphone and HPC innovators are working with TSMC on 3-nanometer technologies. Our N3 successfully entered volume production and enjoyed a strong ramp in the second half of '23, accounting for 6% of our total wafer revenue in 2023. N3E further leveraged the strong foundation of N3 to extend our N3 family with enhanced performance, power, and yield. N3E has already entered volume production in the fourth quarter of 2023. Supported by robust demand from customers in both smartphone and HPC applications, we expect revenue from our 3-nanometer technology to more than triple in 2024 and account for mid-teens percentage of our total wafer revenue. We also continue to provide further enhancement of our N3 technology, including N3P and the N3X. With our strategy of continuous enhancements of our 3-nanometer process technologies, we expect strong multiyear demand from our customers and are confident that our 3-nanometer family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Now I will talk about the AI-related demand and our N2 status. The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models, as the amount of computation required for training and inference is increasing. As a result, AI models need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires the use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC's technology position is increasing and we are well-positioned to capture a major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor components in AI. To address the unassessable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading-edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offerings. At the same time, as process technology complexity increased the engagement lead time with customer also started much earlier. Almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt a narrow sheet transistor structure and will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficiency when it is introduced in 2025. Our N2 technology development is progressing well with device performance and yield on track or ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025 with the ramp similar to N3. As part of our N2 technology platform, we also developed the N2 with a backside power rail solution, which is better suited for specific HPC applications based on performance, course, and maturity considerations, and we expect that power rail will be available in the second half of 2025 to customers with production in 2026. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, N2 and its derivatives will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the AI-related growth opportunities going forward. Finally, let me talk about our specialty technology strategies at mature nodes. For TSMC, today around 70% of our total revenue is from 16-nanometer and more advanced nodes, which will range in contribution from 3-nanometer and 2-nanometer technologies in the next several years. This number will only increase. Our mature node exposure is about 20% of our total revenue. TSMC's strategy at mature nodes is to closely work with strategic partners to develop specialty technology solutions to meet customer requirements and create differentiated and long-lasting value to customers. Our focus is to pursue higher capacity for specialty technologies rather than just nominal capacity. Given the development of differentiated specialty technologies, the profitability of our mature nodes can be around our corporate average gross margin. Looking ahead, we forecast 28-nanometer will be the sweet spot for our embedded memory applications and we expect our long-term structural demand at 28-nanometer to be supported by multiple types of specialty technologies. Thus, we are expanding our 28-nanometer specialty manufacturing capacity overseas to support the long-term structural market demand. We believe the demand for differentiated specialty technology will remain steady despite the potential industry capacity increase and our utilization rate and structural profitability will be well protected in the future. This concludes my prepared remarks. And now, let me turn the microphone over to Mark.",

          "content": "Thank you, C.C. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for years to come. In today's fractured globalization environment, our strategy is to expand our global manufacturing footprint to increase our customer trust, expand our future growth potential, and reach for more global talent. Our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs and a necessary level of government subsidy or support. This is to maximize the value for our shareholders. Firstly, in Japan, we are building a specialty technology fab in Kumamoto, which will utilize 12-nanometer, and 16-nanometer, and 22-nanometer, and 28-nanometer process technologies. We will hold an opening ceremony for this fab on February 2024, next month, and volume production is on track for the fourth quarter of 2024. In Arizona, we are in close and constant communication with the U.S. government on incentive and tax credit support and making strong progress in facility supply chain infrastructure, utility supply, and equipment installation for our first fab. We continue to work closely and develop strong relationships with our local union and trade partners in Arizona, including recently signed an agreement with the Arizona Building and Construction Trades Council for our new framework for cooperation. This agreement extends our collaboration across enhanced workforce training and development, shared commitment to site safety, hiring local workers, and establishing regular communication. It is a win-win for all parties. We are well on track for volume production of N4 or 4-nanometer process technology in the first half of 2025 and are confident that once we begin operations, we will be able to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan. In Europe, we plan to build a specialty technology fab in Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial applications with our joint venture partners. We continue to be in close communication with the German federal, state, and city governments, and their commitment to this project remains strong and unchanged. Fab construction is scheduled to begin in Q4 2024 this year. In Taiwan, of course, we continue to invest in and expand our advanced technology capacities to support our customers' needs and their growth. Given the robust multiyear demand for our 3-nanometer technologies, we are expanding our 3-nanometer capacity in Taiwan Science Park. We are also preparing for our N2 volume production starting in 2025. We plan to build multiple fabs or multiple phases of 2-nanometer technologies in both Hsinchu and Kaohsiung Science Parks to support strong structural demand from our customers C.C. just mentioned. In Kaohsiung Science Park, the government approval process is ongoing and is also on track. While the initial cost of overseas fabs I previously mentioned are higher than TSMC's fabs in Taiwan, we are confident to manage and minimize the cost gap and remain committed to deliver profitable growth and maximize the value for our shareholders. Now let me talk about my retirement. On December 19th last year, I announced that I have decided not to seek nomination of Board members for the next term, and will retire from the company after the 2024 Annual Shareholders Meeting in June. Allow me to say this, over the past 30 years, I have been incredibly fortunate to work at and contribute to TSMC. I started at TSMC 30 years ago as a leader of a small four-person fab construction team. It has been my privilege to serve as Chairman of TSMC after our legendary Founder, Dr. Morris Chang, over the last six years. During this time, we have reaffirmed our commitment to our mission to be the trusted technology and capacity provider to the global logic IC industry for years to come while adhering to our core values of integrity, commitment, innovation, and customer trust. TSMC's success is predicated on providing the industry's most leading-edge processing technology at scale, in a cost-effective manner, to enable all the innovators to successfully offer their best products to the world. Together, we have worked diligently to enhance our focus on our technology leadership, competitiveness, global manufacturing footprint, digital excellence, sustainability, and corporate governance to maximize the value for our customers and our shareholders. The past 30 years with TSMC has been an extraordinary journey for me, and I want to extend my sincerest thanks to our incredible, talented team and all of TSMC's colleagues whose diligence, dedication, and can-do spirit have made the company into what it is today. Now, TSMC's nomination, corporate governance, and sustainability committee of the board has recommended Dr. C. C. Wei to succeed as the company's next Chairman, subject to the election of the incoming board in June 2024. If Dr. Wei is elected to be Chairman, he should also continue in his current role as CEO. Supported by a deep and experienced team of Senior Executives, many of whom have been with TSMC for many years, I remain fully confident in TSMC's strategy, leadership, and execution and firmly believe TSMC will continue to perform outstandingly in the years ahead. Thank you for your trust in TSMC, and the best is yet to come for the company and its shareholders. This concludes my messages and our key messages together.",

I am very curious about your comments about the technology leadership, because your competitor claims that their PPA is ahead of your 2-nanometer, even the cost is lower. So, I want to consult your opinion on why there's a different story and how do we judge. And given these debates, how is TSMC going to plan the future capacity for this customer and also competitor? We want to seize this opportunity but also avoid any overexpansion.",

The comment stays the same, so their technology would be very similar or equivalent to TSMC's N3P. We further checked again with all the specs or the possible published in technology, transistor technology, and everything. My comment stays the same with a significant advantage in technology maturity. Because in 2025, when they say that their newest technology will go into production, for TSMC, that will be the third year with very high-volume production in the fabs. So again, I don't want to make too much of a comment on my customer's claim, but let me assure you we continue to have technology leadership, and we continue to have a broader base of customers who are almost all working with TSMC.",

But I would like you to look at a different perspective. What C.C. and the other side claim might be right, but it's only for their own product, and IDN typically optimizes their technology for their product. We, as a foundry, optimize our technology for our customers' products. So, that's a significant difference. What you use for the high-power server could be very different than what is used for the smartphone or even the large data edge AI processors.

I believe our global investors appreciate your past six-year contribution, creating a lot of shareholder value. Thank you. My question is about the content of your speech in November. The speech was about TSMC in the era of AI. You mentioned some very interesting data points. You used AI technology to improve the defect classification, and also the EUV throughput by, for example, 10%. Now with generative AI, can it be a significant breakthrough in terms of technology? Do you think Samsung or Intel, by leveraging generative AI, can really break through and catch up to your technology?

The purpose I want to convey was that I see artificial intelligence as a great opportunity for the industry in Taiwan. Just like Taiwan is a big country for semiconductors, it can also become a prominent player for artificial intelligence in the future; that was how I aimed to encourage them. As far as whether our competitors are using AI, of course, they use AI. Just look at all the AI companies in Silicon Valley or the U.S., that's not a secret. But on the other hand, AI is only in its nascent stage. Only last November, the first large language model, ChatGPT, was announced. We are only beginning to see the tip of the iceberg. I want to offer an optimistic note that, even though 1-nanometer or sub-1-nanometer could be challenging, we have a new technological capability using AI to accelerate innovation in science, and that is our part. We have been working on that for many years already. So, of course, it's a fair competition and a solid endeavor.",

By the middle of this year, I think we can be quite sure we will accomplish that. Of course, C.C. just mentioned that our technology development is on the slew of success. By June this year, we will know what we are to expect in 2025. I set a milestone for our executives. I don't want to share with you, but it's going to be very exciting for TSMC. Of course, from now on, I simply want to encourage our people in TSMC that the world has changed. Just like you mentioned, we must use artificial intelligence for future technologies. So, we will go global, trying to enhance our global footprint and strive for digital excellence. By digital excellence, I mean that we cannot rely exclusively on the hard work of Taiwan engineers; we must recreate our role to tap their talents and bring semiconductor technology engineering to a different level, based on what we already have. Of course, corporate governance is one thing that will always be in my heart. During this transition, I want every executive and our board to adhere to sound corporate governance so that we ensure all process steps abide by our ethical governance rules.",

And could you also explain the gross margin dilution that you're expecting in the second half of 2023 because of this capacity conversion. What exactly leads to that gross margin dilution?

N3 volume will be much bigger in the second half than in the first half. So the second half impact from N3 dilution will be between 3 percentage points to 4 percentage points. Additionally, the N5 capacity converted to N3 will mostly occur in the second half as well. That will result in 1 to 2 percentage points. That's for this year. For the longer term, if you look at these two factors, our N3 dilution will gradually reduce because the profitability will continue to improve in the next several years. The N5 converted to N3 is a one-time short-term impact on profitability, which will bring capital efficiency to us in the medium to long term. The benefits together would be much greater than the one-time hit in the short term. If you're talking about the longer-term profitability, including these two factors plus we are selling our value, our technology value, as C.C. mentioned, we continue to drive down the cost.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the first quarter 2024. After that, I will provide the guidance for the second quarter 2024. First quarter revenue decreased 5.3% sequentially in NT dollars or 3.8% in U.S. dollars as our business was impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued HPC-related demand. Gross margin increased 0.1 percentage point sequentially to 53.1%, mainly reflecting product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality, partially offset by a less favorable foreign exchange rate. Total operating expenses accounted for 11.1% of net revenue, which is lower than the 12% implied in our first quarter guidance, mainly due to tighter expense controls. Thus, operating margin increased 0.4 percentage points sequentially to 42%. Overall, our first quarter EPS was TWD8.7 and ROE was 25.4%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 9% of wafer revenue in the first quarter, whilst 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 37% and 19%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below, accounted for 65% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 3% quarter-over-quarter to account for 46% of our first quarter revenue. Smartphone decreased 16% to account for 38%. IoT increased 5% to account for 6%. Automotive remained flat and accounted for 6%, and DCE increased 33% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD1.9 trillion or USD 60 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD113 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD140 billion in accrued liabilities and others, partially offset by the decrease of TWD44 billion in accounts payable. The increase in accrued liabilities and others was mainly due to the reclassification of the temporary receipt from customers from long-term liabilities. Our financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained at 31 days, while days of inventory increased 5 days to 90 days, primarily due to ramp of 3-nanometer technologies. Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the first quarter, we generated about TWD436 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD181 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD78 billion for second quarter 2023 cash dividend. In addition, we raised TWD23 billion in cash from bond issuances. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD233 billion to TWD1.7 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our first quarter capital expenditures totaled $5.77 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, partially offset by continued smartphone seasonality. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 19.6 billion and USD 20.4 billion, which represents a 6% sequential increase and 27.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD32.3, gross margin is expected to be between 51% and 53%, operating margin between 40% and 42%. Also, in the second quarter, we will need to accrue the tax on the undistributed retained earnings. As a result, our second quarter tax rate will be slightly above 19%. The tax rate will then fall back to 13% to 14% level in the third and fourth quarter, and the full year tax rate will be between 15% to 16% compared to 14.5% in 2023. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by making some comments on the impact from the April 3 earthquake. On April 3, an earthquake of 7.2 magnitude struck Taiwan, and the maximum magnitude at our fabs was 5. Safety systems and protocols at our fabs were initiated immediately, and all TSMC personnel are safe. Based on TSMC's deep experience and capabilities in earthquake response and damage prevention as well as regular disaster drills, the overall tool recovery in our fabs reached more than 70% within the first 10 hours and were fully recovered by the end of the third day. There were no power outages, no structural damage to our fabs, and there's no damage to our critical tools, including all of our EUV lithography tools. That being said, a certain number of wafers in process were impacted and had to be scrapped, but we expect most of the lost production to be recovered in the second quarter and, thus, minimal impact to our second quarter revenue. We expect the total impact from the earthquake to reduce our second quarter gross margin by about 50 basis points, mainly due to the losses associated with wafer scraps and material loss. Next, let me talk about our first quarter '24 and second quarter '24 profitability. Compared to fourth quarter 2023, our first quarter gross margin slightly increased by 10 basis points sequentially to 53.1%, primarily driven by product mix changes due to smartphone seasonality. We have just guided our second quarter gross margin to decline by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint, primarily due to the impact from the earthquake on April 3, as just discussed, and higher electricity cost in Taiwan. After last year's 17% electricity price increase from April 1, TSMC's electricity price in Taiwan has increased by another 25% starting April 1 this year. This is expected to take out 70 to 80 basis points from our second quarter gross margin. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the impact from higher electricity cost to continue and dilute our gross margin by 60 to 70 basis points. We also expect the higher electricity cost to indirectly lead to higher materials, chemicals and gases and other variable costs. In addition, we expect our overall business in the second quarter of the year to be stronger than the first half. And the revenue contribution from 3-nanometer technologies is expected to increase as well, which will dilute our gross margin by 3 to 4 percentage points in second half of '24 as compared to 2 to 3 percentage points in first half of '24. Finally, as we have said before, we have a strategy to convert some 5-nanometer tools to support 3-nanometer capacity given the strong multiyear demand. We expect this conversion to dilute our gross margin by about 1 to 2 percentage points in the second half of 2024. To manage our profitability in second half 2024, we will work diligently on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to sell our value. Longer term, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable.",

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. I would like to reiterate the guidance for the second quarter. For Q2 2024, we anticipate strong demand for our leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, although this will be partially offset by ongoing smartphone seasonality. Based on our current outlook, we expect our second quarter revenue to be between USD 19.6 billion and USD 20.4 billion, which indicates a 6% sequential increase or a 27.6% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Assuming an exchange rate of USD 1 to TWD32.3, we expect the gross margin to fall between 51% and 53%, and the operating margin between 40% and 42%. Additionally, in Q2, we will need to account for tax on undistributed retained earnings, leading to a tax rate slightly above 19% for the quarter. This rate is expected to decrease to between 13% and 14% in the third and fourth quarters, with the full-year tax rate projected to be between 15% and 16%, up from 14.5% in 2023.  Now, I will address the impact of the April 3 earthquake. A 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Taiwan, resulting in a maximum magnitude of 5 at our fabs. Safety protocols were immediately activated, and all TSMC personnel are safe. Thanks to our experience and established earthquake response measures, over 70% of our tools were operational within the first 10 hours, and we were fully recovered by the end of the third day. There were no power shortages or structural damage to our fabs, and all critical tools, including EUV lithography equipment, remain unaffected. However, some wafers in process were impacted and had to be scrapped, but we anticipate recovering most of this lost production in Q2, leading to minimal impact on our revenue for the quarter. The total impact of the earthquake is expected to reduce our gross margin by about 50 basis points due to wafer scrap and material loss. In terms of profitability for Q1 and Q2 2024, our Q1 gross margin saw a slight increase of 10 basis points to 53.1% compared to Q4 2023, attributed mainly to changes in product mix resulting from smartphone seasonality. We have recently projected a decline in our Q2 gross margin by 1.1 percentage points to 52% at the midpoint, primarily due to the earthquake impact and higher electricity costs in Taiwan. Following a 17% increase in electricity prices last April, there has been an additional 25% increase beginning this April, which is expected to reduce our Q2 gross margin by 70 to 80 basis points.  Looking forward to the second half of the year, we expect higher electricity costs to persist, further affecting our gross margin by 60 to 70 basis points. Additionally, these increased electricity costs may indirectly contribute to rising material, chemical, gas, and other variable costs. We anticipate that business performance in the second half of the year will surpass that of the first half, with increased revenue contributions from 3-nanometer technologies, which will reduce our gross margin by 3 to 4 percentage points in the latter half compared to 2 to 3 percentage points in the first half.  As previously mentioned, we aim to convert some 5-nanometer tools to support 3-nanometer capacity due to the robust multiyear demand, which is expected to further dilute our gross margin by 1 to 2 percentage points in the second half of 2024. To maintain profitability during this period, we will focus on internal cost improvement efforts while continuing to emphasize our value proposition. In the long term, excluding foreign exchange impacts and considering our manufacturing expansion plans, we continue to forecast achieving a gross margin of 53% and above.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I start, I would like to take a moment to make a few remarks. On April 3, TSMC experienced a significant earthquake with a magnitude of 7.2. Our deepest sympathies go out to everyone affected by this tragedy. I also want to express my gratitude to all our employees and suppliers for their hard work during this time. Despite being the largest earthquake in Taiwan in the last 25 years, we collaborated diligently and managed to resume operations at all our fabs within 3 days with minimal disruptions, showcasing the resilience of our operations in Taiwan. Lastly, I would like to extend our appreciation to our customers for their understanding and support as we work to recover lost production during the second quarter. Now, I will begin my prepared remarks with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our first quarter with revenue of USD 18.9 billion, slightly above our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the first quarter was affected by smartphone seasonality, which was somewhat balanced by ongoing demand related to high-performance computing. Moving into the second quarter of 2024, we anticipate strong support for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies, though smartphone seasonality will still have an impact. For the full year 2024, macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue, which could further affect consumer sentiment and end-market demand. Consequently, we now expect the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to recover at a more moderate and gradual pace in 2024. We lowered our forecast for the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to a growth rate of around 10% year-over-year, while we now project foundry industry growth to be in the mid- to high-teens percentage range, both coming off a steep inventory correction and/or base from 2023. That said, we expect 2024 to be a year of healthy growth for TSMC. Given our technology leadership and broad customer base, we expect our business to grow quarter-over-quarter throughout 2024 and reaffirm our full-year revenue increase to be in the low to mid-20% range in U.S. dollar terms. Next, I will discuss the strong outlook for demand related to AI. The ongoing surge in AI-related demand reinforces our belief that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing is accelerating in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC plays a vital role in enabling AI applications. AI technology is evolving to utilize increasingly complex models, which necessitate more powerful semiconductor hardware. Regardless of the approach taken, it requires the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Therefore, our technological position is becoming increasingly valuable as customers depend on TSMC to deliver advanced process and packaging technology at scale with a reliable and predictable cadence. In summary, our technology leadership enables TSMC to secure business and allows our customers to thrive in their respective markets. Almost all AI innovators are collaborating with TSMC to meet the growing demand for energy-efficient computing power. We expect the revenue contribution from several AI processors to more than double this year, accounting for low-teens percentage of our total revenue in 2024. Over the next 5 years, we anticipate this revenue to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate, increasing to over 20% of our revenue by 2028. Several AI processors are specifically defined as GPUs, AI accelerators, and CPUs performing training and inference functions, excluding networking edge or on-device AI. We believe several AI processors will be the key drivers of our high-performance computing platform growth and the largest contributor to our overall incremental revenue growth in the coming years. Now, let me update you on our global manufacturing footprint. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logic IC industry for many years to come. Given the strong demand for high-performance computing and AI, it's strategically important for TSMC to expand our global manufacturing footprint to continue supporting our U.S. customers' growth, enhance customer trust, and expand our future growth potential. In Arizona, we have received strong commitments and support from our U.S. customers and plan to build 3 fabs to create greater economies of scale. Each fab in Arizona will feature a cleanroom area approximately double the size of a typical logic fab. We have made significant progress on our first fab, which commenced engineering wafer production in April using the N4 process technology. We are on track for volume production in the first half of 2025. Our second fab has been upgraded to utilize 2-nanometer technologies to meet strong AI-related demand, in addition to the previously announced 3-nanometer technology. We have recently completed structural work, with volume production set to start in 2028. We also announced plans for a third fab in Arizona utilizing 2-nanometer or more advanced technologies, with production slated to begin by the end of the decade. We are confident that once we commence volume production, we will maintain the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability in our Arizona fabs as we do in Taiwan. In Japan, we held an opening ceremony in February for our first specialty technology fab in Kumamoto. This fab will employ 12/16 and 22/28-nanometer processes and is on target for volume production in the fourth quarter of this year. Alongside our JV partners, we also announced plans for a second specialty fab in Japan, focusing on 40, 12/16, and 6/7-nanometer technologies to support a strategic customer in consumer, automotive, industrial, and HPC-related applications. Construction is expected to begin in the second half of 2024, aiming for production by the end of 2027. In Europe, we plan to establish a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, concentrating on automotive and industrial applications, with construction set to commence in the fourth quarter of this year. Our overseas decisions are guided by our customers' needs and the requisite level of government support, aimed at maximizing value for our shareholders. In today's fragmented globalization landscape, costs are rising for all, including TSMC, our customers, our competitors, and the entire semiconductor industry. We intend to manage and minimize the cost gap overseas by strategically pricing to reflect the value of geographic flexibility, collaborating closely with governments for support, and leveraging our manufacturing technology leadership and large-scale base, which no other manufacturer in this industry can match. Therefore, even after accounting for the increased costs of overseas fabs, we are confident in delivering a long-term gross margin of 53% or higher and a sustainable return on equity exceeding 25%, as we have committed to our shareholders. At the same time, TSMC aims to be the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer in the regions where we operate. We are dedicated to providing our customers with the most advanced technology at scale to aid their growth. Lastly, I will discuss our N2 status. Our N2 technology leads the industry in addressing the growing need for energy-efficient computing, and nearly all AI innovators are partnering with TSMC. We are seeing a high level of customer interest and engagement with N2 and anticipate that the number of new tape-outs from 2-nanometer technology in its initial 2 years will surpass both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first 2 years. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt the nanosheet transistor structure and will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in terms of density and energy efficiency. Development of N2 technology is progressing smoothly, with device performance and yield on schedule or ahead of plan. N2 is on track for volume production in 2025, with a ramp profile similar to N3. With our commitment to continuous improvement, N2 and its derivatives will further strengthen our technology leadership and enable TSMC to seize AI-related growth opportunities well into the future. This concludes my key messages, and I appreciate your attention.",

However, AI-related data center demand is very, very strong. And the traditional server demand is slow, lukewarm. IoT and consumer remain sluggish. Automotive inventory continues to correct, okay? What does that mean to TSMC? The budget for a hyperscale player, their wallet share shifted from traditional server to AI server is favorable for TSMC. And we are able to capture most of the semiconductor content in an AI server's area as we define the GPU, networking processor, etc. Well, we have a lower presence in those CPU-only, CPU-centric traditional servers.

N5 or N7 before, it was like 8 to 10 quarters to reach the corporate. But for N3, we think it will take about 10 to 12 quarters. And this is probably because N3 process complexity has increased, and also our corporate average gross margin also increased during the period. But another reason is that we set the pricing of N3 very early, several years ahead of production. However, we experienced a lot of cost inflation pressures in the following years. So as a result, N3 will take a longer time than N5 and N7 to reach the corporate average gross margin. For N2, based on what we can see so far is that we are doing a better job in cost and selling our value, and we expect N2 to have a better margin profile than N3.",

Overall, I believe on-device AI will greatly benefit TSMC as we will capture a larger share of the market. Did I answer your question, Laura?",

So it's much easier for TSMC to convert from 5 to 3. And that doesn't mean that every node can do the same. That's one. And your question about the N7 converted to N5, presumably. No, because we expect the N7 in the next couple of years, it will pick up, the demand will pick up again. And you want to repeat the same kind of experience we have in 28-nanometer.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with the financial highlights for the second quarter of 2024. After that, I will provide the guidance for the third quarter 2024. Second quarter revenue increased 13.6% sequentially in NT or 10.3% in U.S. dollars, as our business was supported by strong demand for our industry-leading three- and five-nanometer technologies, partially offset by the continued smartphone seasonality. Gross margin increased 10 basis points sequentially to 53.2%, mainly reflecting cost improvement and a more favorable foreign exchange rate, partially offset by the margin impact from M3 RAM. Due to the operating leverage, total operating expense accounted for 10.5% of net revenue as compared to 11.1% in the first quarter. Thus, operating margin increased 0.5 percentage points sequentially to 42.5%. Overall, our second quarter EPS was TWD 9.56 and ROE 26.7%. Now, let's move on to revenue by technology. Three-nanometer process technology contributed 15% of wafer revenue in the second quarter, while five-nanometer and seven-nanometer accounted for 35% and 17%, respectively. Advanced technology, defined as seven-nanometer and below, accounted for 67% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 28% quarter over quarter to account for 52% of our second-quarter revenue, surpassing 50% for the first time. Smartphone decreased 1% to account for 33%. IoT increased 6% to account for 6%. Automotive increased 5% to account for 5% and DCE increased 20% to account for 2%. Moving on to the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD 2 trillion or USD 63 billion. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by TWD 23 billion mainly due to the increase of TWD 16 billion in accounts payable. Long-term interest-bearing debt increased by TWD 9 billion mainly as we raised TWD 12 billion in corporate bonds. On financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days decreased by three days to 28 days. Days of inventory decreased by seven days to 83 days primarily due to higher N3 wafer shipment. Regarding cash flow and capex. During the second quarter, we generated about TWD 378 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD 206 billion in capex, and distributed TWD 91 billion for third quarter '23 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD 101 billion to TWD 1.8 trillion at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our second-quarter capital expenditures totaled TWD 6.36 billion. I finished my financial summary. Now, let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our third quarter revenue to be between USD 22.4 billion and USD 23.2 billion, which represents a 9.5% sequential increase or 32% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on the exchange rate assumption of USD 1 to TWD 32.5, gross margin is expected to be between 53.5% and 55.5%, operating margin between 42.5% and 44.5%. This concludes my financial presentations. Now, let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our second quarter '24 and third quarter '24 profitability. Our second quarter gross margin was 53.2%, slightly ahead of the high end of our guidance, mainly as we saw a higher-than-expected overall capacity utilization rate as compared to our forecast three months ago. We have just guided our third-quarter gross margin to increase by 1.3 percentage points to 54.5% at the midpoint. This is primarily due to the higher overall capacity utilization rate in the third quarter and better cost improvement efforts, including productivity gains, partially offset by continued dilution from N3 ramp-up, N5 to N2 conversion costs, and higher electricity prices in Taiwan. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate, of which we have no control over, and factoring in the margin impact from our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast interim gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2024 capital budget. Every year, our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years, and our capex and capacity planning is always based on the long-term market demand profile. As the strong structural AI-related demand continues, we continue to invest to support our customers' growth. We are narrowing the range of our 2024 capital budget to be between USD 30 billion and USD 32 billion as compared to USD 28 million to USD 32 billion previously. Between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mass making, and others. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with the higher growth opportunities in the following years. Now, let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to begin with our demand outlook for the near term. We ended our second quarter with revenue of USD 20.8 billion, surpassing our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in this quarter was bolstered by robust demand for our industry-leading three-nanometer and five-nanometer technologies, although we did face some challenges due to ongoing smartphone seasonality. Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2024, we anticipate strong support from smartphone and AI-related demand for our advanced process technologies. For the full year 2024, we project a 10% increase in the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, which is consistent with our forecast from three months ago.  We are also redefining our original definition of the foundry industry to what we now call foundry 2.0. This new definition encompasses packaging, testing, mass making, and all integrated device manufacturers, excluding memory manufacturing. We believe this change better captures TSMC's expanding market opportunities. However, I want to stress that TSMC will remain focused on the most advanced back-end technologies to assist our customers in developing leading-edge products. According to this new definition, the foundry industry size was approximately USD 250 billion in 2023, compared to USD 115 billion previously. We forecast that the foundry industry will grow nearly 10% year over year in 2024. TSMC held a 28% share of this market in 2023, bolstered by our technology leadership and broad customer base; we expect this share to increase in 2024. In the past three months, we have witnessed a significant rise in AI and high-end smartphone-related demand from our customers compared to three months ago, resulting in an increased overall capacity utilization rate for our advanced three-nanometer and five-nanometer process technologies in the first half of 2024. Therefore, we continue to anticipate a strong growth year for TSMC in 2024. We are raising our full-year guidance, now projecting our 2024 revenue to slightly exceed mid-20% growth in U.S. dollar terms. Next, I will cover TSMC's capacity planning and investment strategies, particularly crucial given the high forecasted demand from AI-related businesses. TSMC aims to be the reliable technology and capacity provider for the global logical integrated circuit industry for the foreseeable future. The ongoing surge in AI-related demand underlines a strong structural demand for energy-efficient computing. As numerous AI applications emerge, the value of our technological capabilities is increasingly recognized, and our customers depend on us for the most advanced process and packaging technologies at scale in an efficient and cost-effective manner.  Consequently, TSMC implements a disciplined approach to align with this long-term demand driven by AI, high-performance computing, and 5G trends. We collaborate closely with our customers for capacity planning and maintain a thorough system evaluating market demand from both top-down and bottom-up perspectives to decide on appropriate capacity investments. Our capital investment choices hinge on four guiding principles: technology leadership, manufacturing flexibility and responsiveness, maintaining customer trust, and ensuring sustainable and healthy returns. To achieve worthwhile returns from our investments, both pricing and costs matter. TSMC's pricing strategy is designed to provide value rather than being opportunistic. Currently, we are heavily investing in leading-edge, specialty, and advanced packaging technologies to bolster our customers' growth and facilitate their success. When our customers succeed, TSMC also thrives. For instance, we are pleased to observe that many of our customers have seen improvements in their profitability over the past few years. However, we've also encountered rising cost pressures due to increased process complexity, higher electricity costs in Taiwan, global fab expansion in higher-cost areas, and other inflationary challenges. Therefore, we will continue to work closely with our customers to demonstrate our value and diligently collaborate with our suppliers to optimize cost performance. We believe these efforts will enable TSMC to achieve sustainable and healthy returns, allowing us to continue investing in technology and capacity to support our customers' growth and our mission as a trusted foundry partner while achieving profitable growth for our shareholders. Lastly, I will discuss the status of our N2 and N16 technology introductions. Our two-nanometer and 16 technologies address the essential need for energy-efficient computing, attracting nearly all AI innovators to work with TSMC. We expect the number of new tape-outs for two-nanometer technologies in their first two years to outpace that of both three-nanometer and five-nanometer technologies during their initial two years. We aim to deliver full node performance improvements of 10% to 15% in speed at the same power, or a 25% to 30% power reduction at the same speed, along with a more than 15% increase in chip density compared to N3E. Development of N2 technology is on track, with device performance and yield meeting or surpassing expectations, leading to potential volume production trends in 2025 with a ramp profile similar to N3. In our ongoing strategy of continuous improvement, we have also introduced N2P, an extension of the N2 family, with an additional 5% performance boost at the same power or a 5% to 10% power advantage at the same speed beyond N2. N2 supports both smartphone and HPC applications, with volume production slated for the second half of 2026. Additionally, we rolled out N16 as our next nano chip-based technology, featuring a Super Power Rail (SPR) as a new offering. TSMC's SPR is a cutting-edge power delivery solution, being the industry's first to include a novel backside contact scheme that maintains gate density and device flexibility. Compared to N2P, N16 delivers an additional 8% to 10% speed enhancement at the same power rate, or a 15% to 20% power reduction at the same speed, along with a 7% to 10% increase in chip density. N16 is ideally suited for specific HPC products with complex signal routing and dense power delivery requirements, with volume production anticipated in the latter half of 2026. We are confident that N2, N2P, N16, and their derivatives will solidify our technology leadership and enable TSMC to seize growth opportunities well into the future.

Regarding AI accelerator and related capacity, both front-end and advanced packaging, it's clear that demand is increasing significantly, with numerous customers seeking capacity at TSMC. In our previous discussions a couple of quarters ago, C.C., you mentioned that we anticipated supply and demand to balance by the end of this year. I would like to hear your thoughts on the current supply-demand balance for AI accelerator and CoWoS advanced packaging capacity. Additionally, during your symposium, you mentioned a 60% compounded growth rate for CoWoS capacity over the next four to five years. Could you provide details on how much CoWoS capacity you plan to build next year? Last year, you stated that you would be doubling the capacity this year.

Are we likely to return to the high 50% to 60% gross margins seen in 2022, considering you're selling more of your value and benefiting from yield improvements?

We are effectively selling our value while also driving down costs and increasing productivity. Conversely, we might convert more N5 to N3 due to strong demand, which would have a negative impact in the year we do it, but ultimately be beneficial in the future. We are also dealing with cost challenges, particularly due to inflation and rising electricity prices. Additionally, we will start producing at our overseas fabs next year, including Phase 1 of the Arizona fab and Phase 1 of the Kumamoto fab. We anticipate these overseas fabs will reduce our gross margins by two to three percentage points in the coming years. Nonetheless, taking all this into account, we're confident that we can achieve a gross margin of 53% or higher, especially with our cost management efforts in Taiwan.

And I think you told us basically treat 10 and 7 as one large node, 20 and 16 as one large node.

He notes that we have always talked about building in tool commonality to provide us flexibility. We have done so in the past that certain nodes like 20 and 16, 10 and seven. So, his question is really we had said that we potentially convert more N5 tools to support the strong demand for N3 capacity. So, his question is should we, investors, start to think of N5 and N3 as one big node?",

You're correct in understanding that it is expected to double again in 2025. Additionally, as customers transition from CoWoS-S to CoWoS-L and CoWoS-R solutions, there are several changes that may help to alleviate capacity constraints.

When I say that we doubled the capacity, this is some in or the different version of the CoWoS together. Which portion is really double which portion is much more than the other one, not going to share with you because this is related to my customer demand. So, from last year to this year, we have more than doubled. And as I said, from this year to next year, we want to double again or probably we want to more than double again. But still, I have to work with our OSAT partners to increase the overall supply to support my customers. Whether that this kind of different version of the CoWoS will give me some flexibility today, yes, and no, because different version has a different tool set.

Now, looking at GenAI, obviously, the technology has lots of great potential, but a new technology also has lots of volatilities where you start to ramp.

And so, I look at it into actually the whole company with many people now examining and study that really is AI is so used for will be used by a lot of people or not. And we test our sales force inside TSMC, while using AI, we are using machine learning scale to improve our productivity, and we found out it's very useful.

That timing is because people are afraid of a shortage, and so automotive, everything, you name it, they are all in shortage. This time, AI alone only AI alone. It will be a very useful tool for human beings to improve all the productivity in our daily life, be it in medical, industry, or in any product, manufacturing industry, or autonomous driving, everything you need the AI.

Therefore, unless every component saves 20%, achieving a 20% reduction overall is unlikely. However, both the accelerator and the CPU are significant contributors to the overall system's power consumption. Even if it's not a full 20%, it's still a considerable portion.

After that, I will provide the guidance for the fourth quarter of 2024. Third quarter revenue increased 12.8% sequentially in NT, as our business was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies. Gross margin increased by 4.6 percentage points sequentially to 57.8%, mainly reflecting a higher capacity utilization rate and cost improvement efforts. Due to operating leverage, total operating expenses accounted for 10.4% of net revenue. Thus, operating margin increased by 5 percentage points sequentially to 47.5%. Overall, our third quarter EPS was 12.54 NT and ROE was 33.4%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3-nanometer process technology contributed 20% of wafer revenue in the third quarter, while 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer accounted for 32% and 17% respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7-nanometer and below accounted for 69% of wafer revenue. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform, HPC increased 11% quarter-over-quarter to account for 51% of our third quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 16% to account for 34%. IoT increased 35% to account for 7%. Automotive increased 6% to account for 5%. DCE decreased 19% to account for 1%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the third quarter with cash and marketable securities of 2.2 trillion NT or $69 billion U.S. dollars. On the liability side, current liabilities increased by 31 billion NT, while long-term interest-bearing debt decreased by 38 billion NT. This change was primarily driven by the reclassification of 42 billion NT in bonds payable from non-current to current liabilities. In terms of financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days remained steady at 28 days. Inventory days increased by four days to 87 days, primarily due to the pre-build of N3 and N5 wafers. Regarding cash flow and CapEx, during the third quarter, we generated about 392 billion NT in cash from operations, spent 207 billion NT in CapEx, and distributed 91 billion NT for fourth quarter \u201823 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased 88 billion NT to 1.9 trillion NT at the end of the quarter. In U.S. dollar terms, our third quarter capital expenditures total $6.4 billion. I have finished my financial summary. Now let's turn to our current quarter guidance. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our fourth quarter revenue to be between $26.1 billion and $26.9 billion U.S. dollars, which represents a 13% sequential increase or a 35% year-over-year increase at the midpoint. Based on exchange rate assumption of $1 U.S. dollar to 32 NT, gross margin is expected to be between 57% and 59%. Operating margin between 46.5% and 48.5%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our third quarter \u201824 and fourth quarter \u201824 profitability. Compared to the second quarter, our third quarter gross margin increased by 460 basis points sequentially to 57.8%, primarily due to a higher capacity utilization rate and better cost improvement efforts, including productivity gains. Compared to our third quarter guidance, our actual gross margin exceeded the high end of the range provided three months ago by 230 basis points, mainly due to a higher than expected overall capacity utilization rate. We have just guided our fourth quarter gross margin to increase by 20 basis points to 58% at the midpoint. This is primarily due to a higher overall capacity utilization rate in the fourth quarter, partially offset by continued dilution from N3 ramp-up, higher electricity prices in Taiwan, and N5 to N3 tool conversion cost. Next, let me talk about our 2024 CapEx. Every year, our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow the future years, and our CapEx and capacity planning is always based on the long-term market demand profile. As the strong structural AI-related demand continues, we continue to invest to support our customers' growth. We now expect our 2024 CapEx to be slightly higher than $30 billion U.S. dollars. Between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies. About 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mass making, and others. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years, and as long as our growth outlook remains strong, we will continue to invest.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon, everyone. First, let me start with our near-term demand outlook. We concluded our third quarter with revenue of U.S. dollar $23.5 billion, above our guidance in U.S. dollar terms. Our business in the third quarter was supported by strong smartphone and AI-related demand for our industry-leading 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer technologies. Moving into fourth quarter, we expect our business to continue to be supported by strong demand for our leading-edge process technologies. We continue to observe extremely robust AI-related demand from our customers throughout the second half of 2024, leading to increasing overall capacity utilization rate for our leading-edge 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer process technologies. At TSMC, we define server AI processor as GPUs, AI accelerators, and CPUs performing training and inference functions, and do not include networking, edge, or on-device AI. We now forecast the revenue contribution from server AI processors to more than triple this year and account for mid-teens percentage of our total revenue in 2024. Supported by our technology leadership and broader customer base, we are well-positioned to capture the industry's growth opportunities. We now forecast our four-year revenue to increase by close to 30% in U.S. dollar terms. Next, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. TSMC's mission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider of the global logic IC industry for years to come. All of our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs. They value some geographic flexibility and necessary level of government support. This is also to maximize the value of our shareholders. In Arizona, we have received strong commitment and support from our U.S. customers and the U.S. federal, state, and city governments and have made significant progress in the past several months. Our plan to build three fabs will help create greater economies of scale, as each of our fabs in Arizona will have a clean room area that is approximately double the size of a typical logical fab. Our first fab entered engineered wafer production in April with 4-nanometer process technology, and the result is highly satisfactory with a very good yield. This is an important operational milestone for TSMC and our customers, demonstrating TSMC's strong manufacturing capability and execution. We now expect volume production of our first fab to start in the beginning of 2025 and are confident to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as from our fabs in Taiwan. Our second and third fabs will utilize more advanced technologies based on our customers' needs. The second fab is scheduled to begin volume production in 2028, and our third fab will begin production by the end of the decade. Thus, TSMC will continue to play a critical and integral role in enabling our customers' success while remaining a key partner and enabler of the U.S. semiconductor industry.",

Recently, obviously, there's been a lot of questions about ROI of Gen AI investments, whether this could end up being a bubble. How does TSMC view this trend as you're making your capacity plans given you are enabling pretty much the processing capacity for pretty much everybody? And what gives you the confidence that this is going to be a more longer run growth cycle? And relative to this, could C.C. also talk a little bit about what do you think about the duration of this current semiconductor up cycle? Do you think it will continue into the next couple of years or are we getting closer to the peak of the cycle? That's my first question.",

He notes recently there's been a lot of questions about the return or ROI from generative AI investments and therefore how do we view this trend? Is there a worry that this demand sustainability or maybe a bubble? And very importantly, certainly what gives us the confidence that this could be a more long-run sustainable demand cycle for AI?",

We have talked to our customers all the time, including our hyperscaler customers who are building their own chips. And almost every AI innovator is working with TSMC. And so we probably get the deepest and widest look of anyone in this industry. And why I say it's real, because we have our real experience. We have using AI and machine learning in our fab and R&D operations. By using AI, we are able to create more value by driving greater productivity, efficiency, speed, and quality. And think about it, let me use a 1% productivity gain, that was almost equal to about 1 billion to TSMC. And this is a tangible ROI benefit. And I believe we cannot be the only company that has benefited from this AI application. So I believe a lot of companies right now are using AI to improve their productivity, efficiency, and everything. So I think it's real. Did I answer your question?",

I think usually, if you look at the past cycles of strong demand uptick, TSMC's CapEx also starts to move up quite a bit. This time round, 2023 and 2024, your CapEx has been reasonably stable. It's still a large number, but not really growing a lot in the 30 billion, 31 billion range. How should we think about look forward? When we look forward into the next couple of years, what are you doing? What are you planning for CapEx growth? Is there any reservations that TSMC has about the pace of growth that the CapEx is still a little bit lower? Or should we expect that the CapEx also should start accelerating given you're growing at 30% this year and looks like you're preparing for pretty strong growth the next couple of years as well?",

But however, this time, even with what C. C. described as very real and the beginning of a strong AI demand, these last two years we've kept our CapEx, it's not really been growing much. So his question is, is that because we have any concerns or reservations around the demand sustainability? Or what will the CapEx start to look like the next several years? Will we have to begin to step it back up? Is that roughly what you're asking, Gokul?",

However, we always use a disciplined and thorough system to determine the appropriate capacity to build. And we always review our CapEx plans on an ongoing basis. For TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always going to be related with higher growth opportunities in the coming years. And as long as our growth outlook remains strong, we will continue to invest. Now, as C.C. said, next year looks to be a healthy year. So it is very likely that our CapEx next year will be higher than this year. And we will provide you more updates in January conference.",

Indeed, we expect the dilution from N3 ramp to gradually reduce next year. We continue to sell our value. So these things will help, plus next year will be a healthy growth year. So utilization is also a positive. On the other hand, as we said, there'll be 2 to 3 percentage point dilution from the overseas fabs when we begin to ramp them. At the same time, we are also converting some of our N5 capacity to N3 to meet the strong demand for N3. And also, don't forget there's ramping the N2 in 2026. There will also be some preparation costs for ramping N2. And as we migrate every leading notes, more and more events, this preparation costs will become bigger and bigger. Now, you also know that electricity costs has also risen very recently and the second time in the year. 14% higher for TSMC in October. This is after 15% increase in 2022, 17% increase in 2023, and 25% increase in 2024. Basically, the price has doubled in the last few years. So next year, we think that electricity price for us in Taiwan will be the highest in all the regions that we operate. And the higher electricity price plus other inflationary cost is expected to impact our gross margin by at least 1%. And finally, of course, we do not have any control or cannot forecast foreign exchange rate movement. 1% of foreign exchange rate movement, dollar NT, will have an impact of 40 basis points to our growth margin.",

So when fab 1 begins to improve its profitability, the second phase comes in. And in Arizona, when fab 2 improves, the third phase comes in. Similar situation in Kumamoto.

Again, we view them as our partner, so I don't use the backing power. We always work with them and to move to the next step.

If our customers are doing well, we can be good also. Okay? And you mentioned one thing that I have a little bit concern. You say that TSMC's gross margin now is higher than my customer. It's not true. You know, look at one of the biggest AI suppliers, they have a gross margin that I probably never be able to reach in my life. But anyway, we are very happy to see them be successful, and we are in a different kind of business.

All these kind of things become more growing importance, like packaging, testing, mass making. Right now probably is a little bit higher than 10% of TSMC's total revenue. That's one. And all my competitors, their IDMs in particular, they also have their packaging, testing, and mass making. And so I think Foundry 2.0 is a better reflect TSMC's traceable market.

          "content": "Thank you, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. My presentation will start with financial highlights for the fourth quarter of 2024. After that, I will provide the guidance for the first quarter of 2025. Fourth quarter revenue increased 14.3% sequentially in NT, supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer technologies. Gross margin increased by 1.2 percentage points sequentially to 59%, mainly reflecting a higher capacity utilization rate and productivity gains, partially offset by the dilution of 3 nanometer ramp-up. With operating leverage, total operating expenses accounted for 10% of net revenue. Thus, operating margin increased by 1.5 percentage points sequentially to 49%. Overall, our fourth quarter EPS was 14.45 NT and ROE was 36.2%. Now let's move on to revenue by technology. 3 nanometer process technology contributed 26% of wafer revenue in the fourth quarter. 5 nanometer and 7 nanometer accounted for 34% and 14%, respectively. Advanced technologies, defined as 7 nanometer and below, accounted for 74% of wafer revenue. On a full year basis, 3 nanometer revenue accounted for 18% of 2024 wafer revenue, 5 nanometer 34%, 7 nanometer 17%. Advanced technologies accounted for 69% of total wafer revenue, up from 58% in 2023. Moving on to revenue contribution by platform. HPC increased 19% quarter-over-quarter to account for 53% of our fourth quarter revenue. Smartphone increased 17% to account for 35%. IoT decreased 15% to account for 5%. Automotive increased 6% to account for 4%, DCE decreased 6% to account for 1%. On a full year basis, HPC increased 58% year-on-year. Smartphone, IoT, Automotive, DCE increased 23%, 2%, 4% and 2%, respectively, in 2024. Overall, HPC accounted for 51% of our 2024 revenue, Smartphone accounted for 35%, IoT accounted for 6%, and Automotive accounted for 5%. Moving on to the balance sheet. We ended the fourth quarter with cash and marketable securities of TWD2.4 trillion or $74 billion. On the liabilities side, current liabilities increased by TWD184 billion, mainly due to the increase of TWD71 billion in accounts payable and increase of TWD99 billion in the accrued liabilities and others. In terms of financial ratios, accounts receivable turnover days declined by one day to 27 days, while inventory days decreased by seven days to 80 days, primarily due to shipment of N3 and N5 wafers. Regarding cash flow and CapEx. During the fourth quarter, we generated about TWD620 billion in cash from operations, spent TWD362 billion in CapEx and distributed TWD104 billion for the first quarter 2024 cash dividend. Overall, our cash balance increased TWD241 billion to TWD2.1 trillion at the end of the quarter. In US dollar terms, our fourth quarter capital expenditures total $11.2 billion. Now, let me recap our performance in 2024. Due to the strong demand for our 3 nanometer and 5 nanometer process technologies, we continue to outperform the foundry industry in 2024. Our revenue increased 30% in US dollar terms to $90 billion, or increased 33.9% in NT to TWD2.89 trillion. Gross margin increased 1.7 percentage points to 56.1%, mainly reflecting improvements in overall capacity utilization, partially offset by 3 nanometer dilution and higher electricity costs. With operating leverage, our operating margin increased 3.1 percentage points to 45.7%. Overall, full year EPS increased 39.9% to TWD45.25 and ROE increased 4.1 percentage points to 30.3%. On cash flow. We spent $29.8 billion or TWD956 billion in CapEx, generated TWD1.8 trillion in operating cash flow and TWD870 billion in free cash flow. We pay TWD363 billion in cash dividends in 2024, up 24.5% year-over-year. I've finished my financial summary. Now, let's turn to our current quarter guidance. We expect our business in the first quarter to be impacted by smartphone seasonality, partially offset by continued growth in AI-related demand. Based on the current business outlook, we expect our first quarter revenue to be between $25 billion and $25.8 billion, which represents a 5.5% sequential decline, or a 34.7% year-over-year increase at the mid-point. Based on the exchange rate assumption of $1 to TWD32.8, gross margin is expected to be between 57% and 59%, operating margin between 46.5% and 48.5%. Regarding tax rate, our effective tax rate was 16.7% in 2024. For 2025, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. This concludes my financial presentation. Now let me turn to our key messages. I will start by talking about our fourth quarter 2024 and first quarter 2025 profitability. Compared to the third quarter, our fourth quarter gross margin increased by 120 basis points sequentially to 59%, primarily due to a higher capacity utilization rate and productivity gains, partially offset by dilution from the continued ramp-up of our 3 nanometer technology. We have just guided our first quarter gross margin to decrease by 100 basis points to 58% at the mid-point. This is primarily due to ramp costs associated with N2 and CoWoS expansion, and the start of dilution from our overseas fabs. As a reminder, six factors determine TSMC's profitability. Leadership technology development and ramp-up, pricing, cost reduction, technology mix, capacity utilization, and foreign exchange rate. Looking at full year 2025, given the six factors, there are a few puts and takes I would like to share. On the one hand, we are working hard to increase our value. The dilution impact from our N3 ramp is expected to gradually reduce and we expect our overall utilization rate to moderately increase in 2025. On the other hand, as we have said before, we forecast a 2% to 3% margin dilution impact from the ramp-up of our overseas fabs. The impact is less than 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2025, but we expect it to grow more pronounced throughout the year as our fabs in Kumamoto and Arizona ramp up. We also expect inflationary costs, including higher electricity prices in Taiwan to impact our gross margin by at least 1% in 2025. In addition, there are some ramp-up costs associated with N2 and further conversion of N5 to N3 capacity, which together we expect to impact our gross margin by about 1%. Finally, we have no control over the foreign exchange rate but that may be another factor in 2025. Longer-term, excluding the impact of the foreign exchange rate and considering our global manufacturing footprint expansion plans, we continue to forecast a long-term gross margin of 53% and higher is achievable. Next, let me talk about our 2025 capital budget and depreciation. Every year our CapEx is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years, and our CapEx and capacity planning is based on the long-term market demand profile. At TSMC, a higher level of capital expenditures is always correlated with higher growth opportunities in the following years. In 2024, we spent $29.8 billion, as we continue to invest to support our customers' growth. With our strong technology leadership and differentiation, we are well-positioned to capture the multi-year structural demand from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and HPC. In 2025, we expect our capital budget to be between $38 billion and $42 billion, as we invest to capture the future growth. Out of the $38 billion to $42 billion CapEx for 2025, about 70% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, about 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies, and about 10% to 20% will be spent for advanced packaging, testing, mask making, and others. Our depreciation expense is expected to increase by high-single-digit percentage year-over-year in 2025, as newly incurred depreciation will be partially offset by other nodes rolling off depreciation. Even as we invest for the future growth with this level of CapEx spending in 2025, we remain committed to delivering profitable growth to our shareholders. We also remain committed to a sustainable and steadily increased cash dividend per share on both an annual and quarterly basis. Now, let me turn the microphone over to C.C.",

          "content": "Thank you, Wendell. Good afternoon everyone. First, let me start with a conclusion of 2024 and our 2025 outlook. 2024 was a mixed year of recovery for the global semiconductor industry. AI-related demand was strong while our other applications saw only a very mild recovery, as macroeconomic conditions weigh on consumer sentiment and end market demand. Concluding 2024, the Foundry 2.0 industry, which we define as all logic wafer manufacturing, packaging, testing, mask making, and others increased 6% year-over-year, slightly lower than our previous forecast. Supported by strong demand for our leading edge process technologies, TSMC's revenue increased 30% year-over-year in US dollar terms, outperforming the foundry industry growth. Entering 2025, we expect fabless semiconductor inventory to have returned to a healthier level, exceeding 2024. We forecast the Foundry 2.0 industry to grow 10% year-over-year in 2025, supported by robust AI-related demand and a mild recovery in other end market segments. Supported by our technology leadership and broader customer base, we are confident we can continue to outperform the industry growth. We expect 2025 to be another strong growth year for TSMC, and forecast our full-year revenue to increase by close to mid-20s percent in US dollar terms. Now, I will talk about AI demand and TSMC's long-term growth outlook. We observed robust AI-related demand from our customers throughout 2024. Revenue from AI accelerators, which we now define as AI GPU, AI ASICs, and HBM controllers for AI training and inference in the data center, accounted for close to mid-teens percent of our total revenue in 2024. Even after more than tripling in 2024, we forecast our revenue from AI accelerators to double in 2025, as a strong surge in AI-related demand continues. As a key enabler of AI applications, the value of our technology platform is increasing as customers rely on TSMC to provide the most advanced process and packaging technologies at scale in the most efficient and cost-effective way. To address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile, TSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge specialty and advanced packaging technologies to support their growth. As we have said before, TSMC employs a disciplined and rigorous capacity planning system to evaluate and judge the market demand to determine the appropriate capacity build. This is especially important when we have such high forecast demand from the AI-related business. At the same time, we are committed to earning a sustainable and healthy return that enables us to continue to invest to support our customers, of course, while delivering profitable growth for our shareholders. Underpinned by our technology leadership and broad customer base, we now forecast the revenue growth from AI accelerators to approach a mid-40% CAGR for the five-year period, starting off the already higher base of 2024. We expect AI accelerators to be the strongest driver of our HPC platform growth and the largest contributor in terms of our overall incremental revenue growth in the next several years. Looking ahead, as the world's most reliable and effective capacity provider, TSMC is playing a critical and integral role in the global semiconductor industry. With our technology leadership, manufacturing excellence, and customer trust, we are well positioned to address the growth from the industry megatrends of 5G, AI, and HPC with our differentiated technologies. For the five-year period starting from 2024, we expect our long-term revenue growth to approach a 20% CAGR in US dollar terms, fueled by all four of our growth platforms which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. Next, let me talk about our global manufacturing footprint update. All our overseas decisions are based on our customers' needs, as they value some geographic flexibilities and the necessary level of government support. This is also to maximize the value for our shareholders. In the US, we have a long-standing good relationship with the US government, dating back to even before our Arizona fab project announcement in May 2020. We have received strong commitment and support from the U.S. customers and the U.S. federal, state, and city government, and are making substantial progress. Building on the successful result of our earlier engineering wafer production, we were able to pull ahead the production schedule of our first fab in Arizona. Our first fab has already entered high-volume production in Q4 2024 utilizing N4 process technology with a yield comparable to our fabs in Taiwan. We expect a smooth ramp-up process and with our strong manufacturing capability and execution, we are confident to deliver the same level of manufacturing quality and reliability from our fab in Arizona as from our fab in Taiwan. Our plans for the second and third fabs in Arizona are also on track. These fabs are utilizing even more advanced technologies, such as N3, N2, and A16 based on our customers' needs. Thus, TSMC will continue to play a critical and integral role in enabling our customers' success while remaining a key partner in enabling the US semiconductor industry. Next, in Japan, thanks to the strong support from the Japan central, prefectural, and local government, our progress is also very good. Our first specialty technology fab in Kumamoto has started volume production at the end of 2024 with a record yield. Construction of our second specialty fab is scheduled to begin this year. In Europe, we have received strong commitment from the European Commission and the German federal, state, and city government. We are progressing smoothly with our plans to build a specialty technology fab in Dresden, Germany, focusing on automotive and industrial applications. In Taiwan, we continue to receive support from the Taiwan government, and we are investing in and expanding our advanced technology and packaging capacities. Given the robust multi-year demand for our 3-nanometer technology, we continue to expand our 3-nanometer capacity in Tainan Science Park. We are also preparing for multiple phases of 2-nanometer fabs in both Hsinchu and Kaohsiung Science Park to support the strong structural demand from our customers. We are also expanding our advanced packaging facilities across several locations in Taiwan. As we have said before, under today's fragmented globalization environment, overseas fab costs are higher for everyone, including TSMC and all other semiconductor manufacturers. We are leveraging our fundamental competitive advantage of manufacturing technology leadership and large-scale manufacturing base to be the most efficient and cost-effective manufacturer in the region that we operate while supporting our customers' growth. Finally, I will talk about N2 and A16 introduction. Our 2-nanometer and A16 technologies lead the industry in addressing the insatiable need for energy-efficient computing, and almost all the innovators are working with TSMC. We expect a number of the new tapeout for 2-nanometer technology in the first two years to be higher than both 3-nanometer and 5-nanometer in their first two years, fueled by both smartphone and HPC applications. N2 will deliver full-node performance and power benefit with 10 to 15 times speed improvement at the same power or 20% to 30% power improvement at the same speed, and more than 15% chip density increases as compared with the N3E. N2 is well on track for volume production in the second half of 2025 as scheduled, with a ramp profile similar to N3. With our strategy of continuous enhancement, we also introduced N2P as an extension of the N2 family. N2P features further performance and power benefit on top of N2. N2P will support both smartphone and HPC applications, and volume production is scheduled for the second half of 2026. We will also introduce A16 featuring Super Power Rail, or SPR, a separate offering. TSMC's SPR is an innovative best-in-class backside power delivery solution that is first in the industry to incorporate a novel backside network scheme that preserves gate density and device flexibility to maximize the product benefit. Compared with the N2P, A16 provides a further 8% to 10% speed improvement at the same power, or 15% to 20% power improvement at the same speed, and additional 7% to 10% chip density gain. A16 is best suitable for specific HPC products with a complex signal route and dense power delivery network. Volume production is scheduled for the second half of 2026. We believe N2, N2P, A16 and its derivatives will further extend our technology leadership position and enable TSMC to capture the growth opportunity well into the future. This concludes our key message. And thank you for your attention.",

Your main IDM competitor appears to be having difficulties, while your Arizona fab seems to be performing well. Given all this, I wanted to gain insight into your long-term strategy. Are you considering investing in the latest node in the US now that the Taiwanese government has lifted the restriction? What feedback have you received from discussions with the incoming President Trump administration, especially since they have emphasized the CHIPS Act and show support for your investments made during Trump's first term?

However, the one we're ramping up involves introducing a new technology into manufacturing. The process is very complicated, so it has to be very close to the R&D team. Therefore, the initial phase of the ramp-up always comes from the fab that is close to R&D. In that sense, we do want to ramp up the same kind of technology in the US, but it is practically a little bit difficult. So Taiwan will always be first. Does that answer your question? It's not related to N or N minus 1 certification. Critically, we just have to ramp up a new node in Taiwan.",

Is it feasible for us to exceed a 60% gross margin during this upcycle? Additionally, could you clarify the situation with U.S. fabs compared to overseas fabs? What are the main factors affecting dilution, especially in the U.S. fabs, considering that yield is nearly comparable to Taiwan's? Is the longer cycle time a factor, or are other costs significantly higher in U.S. fabs, given that new fab depreciation is likely similar to that of Taiwan?",

So his question is how should we think about gross margins in this current cycle? Can we approach or get to 60% or low 60s type again?

And secondly, the US fab cost, it is more expensive in the US, mainly because of several reasons. Number one, the smaller scale; number two, the higher price in the supply chain; and number three, the very early stage of the ecosystem.

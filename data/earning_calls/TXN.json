          "content": "Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments First Quarter 2022 Earnings Release Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Dave Pahl. Please, go ahead, sir. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. For those who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi, is with me today, and we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into first quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for second quarter, including the impact from COVID-19 restrictions in China. Starting with a quick overview of first quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $4.9 billion, an increase of 2% sequentially and 14% year-over-year, driven by growth in industrial and automotive, as well as enterprise systems. Analog revenue grew 16%, Embedded Processing grew 2%, and our Other segment grew 27% from the year-ago quarter. Now, let me comment on the environment in the first quarter to provide some context on what we saw with our customers and markets. Overall, the quarter came in about as we expected across product segments, end markets, and geographies. The market environment in the first quarter was similar to what we've observed for the last several quarters. Customers continued to be selective in their expedite requests, focusing on products that completed a matched set, rather than expediting products across the board. This behavior was not specific to any product family, end market, or geography. Moving on, I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end market from the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial and automotive markets were each up about 20% and both were driven by broad-based growth across sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-single digits off a strong compare. And next, communications equipment was up about 10%. And finally, Enterprise Systems was up about 35% off of a weak compare, and the growth was primarily from data centers and enterprise computing. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook. Rafael?",

          "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.9 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.4 billion or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 500 basis points. As a reminder, we had about $50 million of additional utility expenses in cost of revenue related to the winter storm in the year-ago quarter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $830 million, about flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $66 million in the first quarter and are associated with the LFAB purchase we closed in October of last year. Operating profit was $2.6 billion in the quarter or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 32% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $2.2 billion or $2.35 per share, which included a $0.02 benefit that was not in our prior outlook. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations were $2.1 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $443 million in the quarter and $2.6 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $6.5 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $589 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $5 billion in the past 12 months. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.6%. Inventory dollars were up $150 million from the prior quarter to $2.1 billion and days were 127, up 11 days sequentially but still below the higher levels. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.84 to $2.26. This outlook comprehends an impact due to reduced demand from COVID-19 restrictions in China, which are affecting our customers' manufacturing operations. We continue to expect our annual operating tax rate for 2022 to be about 14% and our effective tax rate to be about a point lower. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

First of all, I was wondering if you had any feeling for the size of the gap in revenue that's getting impacted by the COVID issues in China. Do you have any view for like what demand would be if you could ship? And like are the customers getting out of line at all? Is the overall demand and order environment kind of where it was, you just can't ship? But any color you can give on the size of that gap would be helpful.",

          "content": "Yes, Stacy, I'll comment on that. Our assessment in early April indicated that revenue would continue to incrementally grow again in the second quarter. However, it just became clear that we were experiencing lower demand, particularly due to COVID-19 restrictions in China. And just to be clear, customers' behavior wasn't changing as it related to backlog or cancellations. In fact, we continue to see expedites for deliveries. However, we did see that our customers' manufacturing operations were being impacted. So as a result, the approach that we took, we just took a top-down assessment and reduced the midpoint of second quarter by 10%, and so from roughly $5 billion at the midpoint to the $4.5 billion that you see. And the second thing we did was we slightly widened the range just to comprehend the higher uncertainty that we're seeing overall. Do you have a follow-up, Stacy?",

So I wouldn't look at that as any precision in choosing that number. Part of the reason why we widened the guidance, I think trying to get into predictions of what could happen as the quarter unfolds. I think time will tell, and we'll see how that unfolds, and we'll report that when the quarter is over. So that's really the approach that we took at trying to assess what was going on.

So do you continue to plan and build more inventory during the quarter?",

Our factories are running at high levels of utilization as they have been over the last couple of years really. We've continued, in fact, we continue adding incremental capacity, as we have said we would. And the next step beyond incremental will be one RFAB2 starts production in the second half of the year, and then LFAB in the first quarter of next year of 2023. We are going to continue running our production high. We are going to build inventory; inventory did build about $150 million in this last quarter we just reported, but we're still below desired level. So our intent is to continue building that inventory, which is our objective inventory. As you know, our target is to maintain high levels of customer service, and roughly our target is 130 to 190 days, but we want to be at the high end of that, and we would not be uncomfortable even above the high end of that range.",

But to the extent there are shortages across the industry and demand elsewhere, it doesn't sound like it's changed from part of your preamble, Dave. Why wouldn't this allow a little bit of the fungibility of your standard product shipments to just increase to those customers and shortages to make up for the shortfall that you're otherwise going to see in China?",

However, it's important to note that we are dealing with 100,000 different parts and 80,000 different customers, so it doesn't always align perfectly where inventory from one location can be effectively transferred to others.

The behavior that we've talked about now for a couple of quarters that we've been seeing as customers being more focused on match sets and that can be symptomatic of growing customer inventory that's out of mix. So even though we might have some parts that are available in one region, customers may not need them in the other. So, you've got multiple dynamics at work there. Do you have a follow-on?",

The quarter was driven by the industrial and automotive markets. We did see strong growth in enterprise systems, as we had talked about. That was primarily from data center and enterprise computing. Now, that's a small part of our revenue, but you saw it grow strongly last quarter. And as you look over the coming years, that probably will continue to be a strong grower, but it's just not a very large portion of our revenue. So we continue to be pleased with the growth that we're seeing in industrial and automotive. That when you zoom out for a second, that is where the strategic focus has been for the company.

This positions us well to manage input costs without being affected by the pricing strategies of foundries or subcontractors.

If customers are under tight constraints and the lockdowns are expected to be temporary, I would assume they would take the product and increase their inventory. In the past three weeks, you chose to significantly lower your guidance. Is that due to customers delaying shipments, or is it because they are unable to accept shipments of your product? It seems more likely to be the latter, as everything is tight and the entire supply chain is trying to build inventory. Thanks.",

This often indicates an increase in customer inventory that isn\u2019t well balanced. We have tens of thousands of products readily available on our website, so customers can access more products if they are flexible about the types they need. However, they are increasingly focused on finding those match sets to finalize their orders. This can involve our products, but quite often it includes products from our competitors, and sometimes it may even involve items that are not semiconductors necessary for completing their systems. So, it's important to note that just because we have products available, customers are not universally taking them.",

Tim, if I understood your question correctly, regarding the bottleneck for customers in China running their operations, we are observing instances where factories are shut down and cannot accept deliveries. In other situations, freight forwarders are unwilling to transport our parts from our distribution centers to the factories in China, especially in the Shanghai area due to these shutdowns.

I\u2019m Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I\u2019m joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. A replay will be available through the web. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we\u2019ll provide the following updates. First, I\u2019ll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I\u2019ll provide insight into second quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for third quarter 2022. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter was $5.2 billion, an increase of 6% sequentially and 14% year-over-year, driven by growth across markets. Analog revenue grew 15%, Embedded Processing grew 5%, and our Other segment grew 19% from the year-ago quarter. Now let me comment on the environment in the second quarter to provide some context of what we saw with our customers and markets. As we spoke about in our last earnings call, April started out weak from COVID-19 restrictions in China. As those restrictions began to ease towards the latter part of May and into June, customers began to pull product generally consistent with their prior demand forecasts at the start of the quarter. Moving on, I\u2019ll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market from the year-ago quarter. First, the industrial market was up high-single digits and the automotive market was up more than 20%. We saw weakness throughout the quarter in personal electronics, which grew low-single digits. Next, communications equipment was up about 25%. Finally, enterprise systems was up mid-teens. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion or 70% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 240 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $836 million, up 2% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.2 billion or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $66 million in the second quarter and are associated with the LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. Operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter or 52% of revenue. Operating profit was up 23% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $2.3 billion or $2.45 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $597 million in the quarter and $2.8 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1.2 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $6.2 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. We retired $0.5 billion of debt in the quarter. Total debt outstanding was $7.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.7%. Inventory dollars were up $139 million from the prior quarter to $2.2 billion and days were 125, down two days sequentially and below desired levels. Accounts receivable for this quarter ended at $2.2 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago. This increase primarily reflects the higher proportion of shipments made near the end of the quarter, as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted in China and customers began pulling product. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.90 billion to $5.30 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $2.23 to $2.51. This outlook comprehends the weaker demand we see, particularly from customers in the personal electronics market. We expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. Lastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February Capital Management Call and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. We broke ground on the Sherman manufacturing complex in May and work continues at RFAB2 and LFAB to prepare for production output. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

I would also point out that you can see this on our cash flow statement, depreciation increase sequentially by about $30 million and that\u2019s a direct result of the investments in manufacturing capacity. On your second part of your question on a go-forward basis, as expected, depreciation is going to increase. We\u2019ve talked about that in the February call.

Currently, on a trailing 12-month basis, it stands at 30%. You're guiding for Q2 to be below seasonal levels, and Q1 and Q4 are also expected to be lower.

This resulted in much of the cash being tied up in accounts receivable, which I mentioned in my prepared remarks. Consequently, this will somewhat distort your cash flow trends. On a broader scale, we are very enthusiastic about our investments in manufacturing and technology. These investments will strategically position us for long-term growth by providing the necessary manufacturing foundation to support revenue expansion, which will lead to an increase in capital expenditures, as we discussed in February. At that time, we projected an average capital expenditure of $3.5 billion per year from 2020 to 2025. For this year, we expect to spend around $2.5 billion, which aligns with our expectations, though it may be slightly higher. Since the average is $3.5 billion, you would anticipate that the following years will exceed that figure.",

I think there\u2019s some places where that probably will stick and probably some places where it won\u2019t. But I think the most important thing when we look at it, because we won\u2019t manage our customer\u2019s inventory, but we can manage what we do. And we\u2019ve long believed that owning and controlling our inventory is really a strategic advantage. So you\u2019ve seen us take those actions over time. We finished the quarter with just a little over $2 billion of inventory. So whenever things do weaken, we\u2019ll take that time to replenish inventories that will keep lead times stable and low.

They\u2019re close to customers, close to the market, understand what their peers in the industry are doing. So, and to your point, many of our peers in the market that are outsourced, they do have to take action, when they see pricing increases from their suppliers.

Our goal is for inventory to continue to grow. We have talked about a target of 130 to 190 days and as I have said before, I will not be uncomfortable to be at the high end of that range, because ultimately that inventory gives us just tremendous optionality, puts us in a really good position to support customers and just given our business model, the risk on the inventory is nil, because that inventory goes to support products that sell to many, many customers and have very long lives.

And what goes through distribution to my prior comment, we long believed that owning and controlling that inventory is important.

This convenience comes at a higher price. Additionally, there are other factors to consider, such as the variety of products we ship. We offer products that sell for just a few cents and others that cost thousands of dollars each, and depending on where we fall within that range, it can affect the average selling price. That being said, in the current environment we've experienced over the last few quarters, customers have seen price increases for similar products, which has been beneficial as well.

I am Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I am joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today\u2019s call is being recorded, and you will be able to get it via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI\u2019s results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI\u2019s most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we will provide the following updates. First, I will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I will provide insight into third quarter\u2019s revenue results with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. And lastly, Rafael will come to results and our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2022. Starting with a quick overview of the third quarter, revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $5.2 billion, an increase of 1% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue grew 13%, Embedded Processing grew 11%, and our Other segment grew 20% from the year-ago quarter. Now I\u2019ll provide some insight into third quarter revenue by market. This quarter, I will focus on our sequential performance as it\u2019s more informative at this time. First, personal electronics declined mid-teens as we continue to see the weakness we described in the second quarter. Industrial was about even sequentially as we saw weakness begin to broaden in the industrial market. The automotive market remains strong and was about 10%. Next, communications equipment was up high single-digits. And finally, enterprise systems was up mid single-digits. Turning to our expectations for the fourth, we expect that most of our end markets will decline sequentially with the exception of the automotive market. Lastly, we and our customers remain pleased with the progress of our expansion of our manufacturing capacity, which was outlined in our February capital management call and will support the long-term secular trend of increased semiconductor content per system. Customers especially value the geopolitically dependable footprint of our manufacturing additions. We are now in production in RFAB2 and expect production in LFAB later this year. In addition, construction of SM-1 and SM-2 in Sherman, Texas continues as planned. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, third quarter revenue was $5.2 billion, up 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.6 billion or 69% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin increased 110 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $862 million, up 8% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.3 billion or 16% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $77 million in the third quarter and are associated with the LFAB factory that we purchased in October of last year. These charges will move to cost of revenue as we start production. The assets associated with the acquisition of the factory will begin to depreciate at the same time. Moving on, operating profit was $2.7 billion in the quarter or 51% of revenue. Operating profit was up 16% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $2.3 billion or $2.47 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.8 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $790 million in the quarter and $3.1 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $1 billion of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.1 billion in the past 12 months. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 8%, marking our 19th consecutive year of dividend increases. We also increased our share repurchase authorizations by $15 billion. These actions reflect our commitment to returning free cash flow to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. In the quarter, we issued $700 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.8%. Inventory dollars were up $205 million from the prior quarter to $2.4 billion and days were 133, up 8 days sequentially and below these higher levels. For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.4 billion to $4.8 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.83 to $2. This outlook accounts for the market conditions that Dave previously mentioned. We continue to expect our 2022 effective tax rate to be about 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2023, without additional changes to tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain above what it is in 2022 with a similar quarterly profile. Let me now make a few comments on the CHIPS Act that was recently signed into law. The combination of the investment tax credit, the grant as well as funding for research and development will help make the U.S. semiconductor industry more competitive. We accrued about $50 million on the balance sheet in the third quarter due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow through financial statements as lower depreciation and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. In closing, we will stay focused on the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

And I imagine about the same kind of double-digit down in Q4. Do you think are we past the worst of the consumer, or should we be expecting the seasonal decline again for consumer in Q1? I know it\u2019s a little bit further out, but I just wanted to check what you are seeing in terms of consumer right now. And I guess the bigger picture question there is, is TI more exposed to the cyclical downturn versus your peers, because you have the highest consumer exposure? And if that is the case, do you need to do something different given that mix headwind?",

If you look at the market overall, personal electronics is a little more than 50% of the semiconductor market without memory. So we have less than half of the exposure there. If you look at industrial and automotive, that makes up 62% of our revenues. And inside of the market, that\u2019s 26% of the market. So we are really highly exposed to both industrial and automotive and that\u2019s not by accident, is probably more than a decade ago, we began allocating more of our resources to automotive and industrial and the emphasis there. So we are very pleased with our exposure. And we believe that, that will be where there will be more content added into those systems. Now that said, there are great opportunities inside of personal electronics, communications equipment, and enterprise systems in the decades ahead, but we will just have those secular tailwinds more than average inside of industrial and automotive. Do you have a follow-on, Vivek?",

And interestingly, you are suggesting it can grow again in Q4. What\u2019s your sense of kind of the supply-demand balance in automotive among your Tier 1 and then the auto OEM customers? Many investors are concerned that the kind of rolling correction that we are seeing in semi is going to eventually hit automotive, which has been a very strong area over the last 1 to 2 years. So what\u2019s your sense of what kind of the supply-demand balance is in this automotive end market? Thank you.",

So we are just thrilled with the position. If you look at the second quarter of 2020, our growth there has, off the bottom, been very, very strong. Will that market eventually roll over? It will. I mean, that\u2019s just what happens. And we are not trying to predict when that will happen; we will continue to ship product to customers as they request it. And we are really focused on making sure we have capacity in place for them over the long-term. So we are not really trying to worry about when that will happen.

Anything you can give us on linearity or by geography? As we think about what\u2019s baked into the guide, is it more, I guess, conservatism on the macro, or was there really a material change in your customers\u2019 order patterns? Thank you.",

I would say if you look at the third quarter results across the board and also inclusive of industrial, the quarter came in as we had expected. If you look at \u2013 and even sequential is not unusual inside of industrial, that\u2019s about what we were expecting. But as we described, the weakness began to broaden into that. So there wasn\u2019t one place that we could put our finger on to say it was one thing or one group of customers, but we did see just different signals inside of there that are leading us to that conclusion that the weakness is broadening. And in fact, we expect that weakness to broaden into most of the other markets as well as we move into the fourth quarter, of course, with the exception of auto. So that\u2019s really what we are seeing, its order rates. If you look at order rates quarter-to-date, they are of course consistent with our outlook, but they are weak quarter-to-date. And so it\u2019s those types of signals that are leading to the outlook. And really, those are the types of signals that really best inform what our shipments in the quarter and in the short term are going to be. Do you have a follow-up, Joshua?",

Was that from the investment tax credit only? Because I know there is a second bucket for manufacturing incentives. And if not, when should \u2013 when would you expect to, I guess, get more clarity on how much you\u2019ll be able to accrue for the manufacturing incentive portion of the CHIPS Act? Thank you.",

          "content": "Yes. So first, let me step back. Big picture, the combination of the investment actually the grant as well as the funding for research and development will help. The U.S. semiconductor industry is more competitive. We accrued the $50 million that we talked about in the prepared remarks that you referred to, that was for the 25% investment tax credit that is for manufacturing assets that will go into service in 2023 and beyond. And that is \u2013 that was for $200 million. So a quarter of that is what we accrued that we will receive from the government at some point in the future as lower taxes. But in the P&L, it flows. It will flow through lower depreciation. I think maybe what you\u2019re referring to when you talk about manufacturing is the grant portion. Is that what you\u2019re referring to? Well, maybe answer them. But if you are talking about the grant that is part of the CHIPS Act, but it\u2019s separate from the investment tax credit that remains to be seen. We will apply for those, the application window doesn\u2019t open until February. So we will apply for those. And as we learn more, we will let you know. And big picture, when we get to February, at the next capital management call, we will talk about the chipset, the overall investment will try to quantify that and what benefit we will get. At the same time, since the last capital management call, our confidence around the long-term growth prospects in our industry, the secular trends that Dick talked about earlier. That confidence has only grown, so we feel really good about that. So we will tell you about the net impact between those two, the benefits of the chip stack and the growing confidence at the next capital management call and any changes to our numbers based on that.

We\u2019re very excited about that. That is going to decrease on a net basis our investment because we\u2019re going to get a 25% reduction from the investments that qualified and manufacturing investments in the United States. But on the other hand, as I alluded to earlier, our confidence around our long-term growth prospects have only grown over the last six to twelve months based on the secular trends based on input from our customers.

I guess why is it increasing now where is it increased before and what happens going forward? Because if I would just hold it flat on the revenue guide going forward to do something like 19% of revenue, so it is still below your kind of what you\u2019ve talked about in terms of long-term targets for OpEx.

Step back, for the last 5.5 years, really, we\u2019ve been running OpEx on a trailing 12-month basis, which is how I prefer to look at it, at $3.2 billion. Pretty consistently, we\u2019re really steady over that time. Our hiring has been very consistent during that time. And that is underpinned by our long-term expectations on growth. And inside of that, R&D has actually moved up. SG&A has moved down inside of that $3.2 billion, but it\u2019s been really consistent on that. This last quarter for the first time, it ticked up to $3.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. And I would expect that to continue ticking up over the next many quarters and years as we continue stepping up our investments. And that is driven by the higher investments, but inflation is playing a factor. It\u2019s clearly wage inflation. We\u2019re not immune to that.

But it seems like at least personal electronics is back to where you were in \u201819, \u201820. It seems like industrial is going to kind of get back there. And at that point, you\u2019re building inventories. You had more capacity than demand. So if we do go back to those levels and you\u2019re adding more capacity, I\u2019m just trying to understand if still the view that you\u2019ll build inventory like you do in \u201819 and \u201820 and still roll out the capacity for the long-term.",

So capacity, we\u2019ve been adding capacity incrementally for a number of quarters. Now our Fab 2 is in production. Lehi is about to start production within a few months. So clearly, our incremental capacity is going up. At the same time, we\u2019ve been increasing inventory very slowly. And now more recently, we added $200 million of inventory in this last quarter, but we are still below these higher levels. Okay. Keep in mind, our business model is such where we are targeting the vast majority of our parts sell to many, many customers. So they are very broad in nature. The product life cycles of the parts is decades in many times; the products themselves last 10 years in inventory, most of them. So the risk of selection for the inventory is very, very low. The potential upside of having that inventory ready is very high. So that\u2019s why we prefer to have more than less inventory. So I would not be uncomfortable, as I said before, adding another $1 billion, $1.5 billion of inventory over the next several quarters to get us well positioned for the next upturn that invariably comes at some point.",

You really need to look at it over a longer period of time. So look at the rate of growth of us versus the industry from the fourth quarter of \u201819. I just picked that because it\u2019s a pre-pandemic number. And we look very, very good against those numbers. So we were, as you remember, as we went into the pandemic, we continued to build inventory. So the numbers initially looked very, very strong as customers pulled product from us. So when you look some of the sequentials, it was harder, and that\u2019s not making excuses. But when you look at our manufacturing footprint and how we are positioned, you look at the customer excitement around that manufacturing footprint and customers look at where that addition is coming and the geopolitically dependable locations of where that footprint is coming from, we are very confident in where the trajectory of our market share is going longer term.

What I would point you to is, as you can see in the cash flow statement, depreciation is increasing sequentially, has increased sequentially actually for a number of quarters. So, this last quarter, $20-some million. Of course, that is a direct result of the CapEx investments that we are making. And so you should expect depreciation to continue ticking up. I said earlier in the call, we expect this year to be close to $1 billion. So, you can obviously do the math and get fourth quarter depreciation there.

It will take a long time to be able to do it. And it\u2019s not oftentimes just as simple as carrying more inventory on the balance sheet. So, there probably will be some of those customers that do that hard work and restructure the supply chains.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the 'Notice regarding forward-looking statements' contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. First, you likely saw last week we announced that Haviv Ilan will become President and CEO on April 1st and that Rich Templeton will continue as our Chairman. I'm sure you'll want to join me in congratulating both of them. Secondly, let me provide some information that's important to your calendars. Next week on Thursday, February 2nd, at 10:00 a.m. Central time, we will have our capital management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insights into our business and our approach to capital allocation. This will include an update of our 300 millimeter capacity expansion plans to support the increasing confidence that we have in our long-term growth. Moving on, today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our customers and markets. I will then provide an annual summary of our revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for first quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview. Revenue was $4.7 billion, a decrease of 11% sequentially and 3% from the same quarter a year ago. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. A component of the weaker demand was customers working to reduce their inventories. In first quarter, we expect a weaker than seasonal decline, with the exception of automotive, as we believe customers will continue to reduce inventory levels. Turning to our segments, fourth quarter Analog revenue declined 5% year-over-year and Embedded Processing grew 10%. Our Other segment declined 11% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. I'll focus on sequential performance again this quarter, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down about 10%. The automotive market was up mid-single digits with strength in most sectors. Personal electronics was down mid-teens with broad-based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down about 20%, and finally, enterprise systems was also down about 20%. Lastly, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market for 2022. We break our end markets into six categories that are grouped by their life cycles and market characteristics. The six end markets are industrial; automotive; personal electronics, which includes products such as mobile phones, PCs, tablets and TVs; communications equipment; enterprise systems; and other, which is primarily calculators. As a percentage of revenue for 2022, industrial was 40%, automotive about 25%, personal electronics 20%, communications equipment 7%, enterprise systems 6%, and other was 2%. In 2022, industrial and automotive combined made up 65% of TI's revenue, up about three percentage points from 2021 and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technologies to make their end products smarter, safer, more connected and more efficient. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Rafael?",

          "content": "Thanks, Dave. And good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $3.1 billion, or 66% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 320 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $863 million, up 9% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.4 billion, or 17% of revenue. Restructuring charges were $48 million in the fourth quarter and were associated with the LFAB factory preproduction costs. As production started at the beginning of December, these costs then transitioned to cost of revenue, where they will be reflected moving forward. In addition, depreciation has begun on these assets. Operating profit was $2.2 billion in the quarter, or 47% of revenue. Operating profit was down 13% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $2.0 billion, or $2.13 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.11 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2.0 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.0 billion in the quarter. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $5.9 billion, down 6% from a year ago. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $848 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. We also increased our dividend per share by 8% in the fourth quarter, marking our 19th year of dividend increases. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.1 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. In the quarter we issued $800 million in debt. Total debt outstanding was $8.8 billion with a weighted average coupon of 2.93%. Inventory was up $353 million from the prior quarter to $2.8 billion, and days were 157, up 24 days sequentially. Next, to summarize the benefits of the CHIPS Act, we accrued about $350 million on our balance sheet under long-term assets in fourth quarter, in addition to the $50 million accrued in the third quarter. These accruals are due to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2022, cash flow from operations was $8.7 billion. Capital expenditures were $2.8 billion, or 14% of revenue. Free cash flow for 2022 was $5.9 billion, or 30% of revenue. Our cash flow reflects the strength of our business model. As we have said, we believe that growth of free cash flow per share is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.90. We now expect our 2023 annual effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

What happens to LFAB as you, I guess, maybe the timing of that when that starts production and start hitting depreciation?

I'm sure you're going to speak about that on the Capital Day coming up as well.",

For now, what I would tell you is, as you said, RFAB2 is in production, Lehi is in production. So both of those are running that cost now is in cost of revenue, and they\u2019re both depreciating and that that is a function of the \u2013 when the equipment is placed in service, it starts depreciating, right? So as both of those ramps, the equipment goes in service starts depreciating. But big picture, what we told you last year on depreciation was that it would ramp roughly linearly to about $2.5 billion in 2025. And again, we\u2019ll give you an update on that next week, but I do want to say just as I said 90 days ago, that since we talked about this last year, our confidence surrounding our long-term growth prospects have only grown. And if you alluded to, we\u2019ve had the CHIPS Act also since last year that, that legislation pass in August. So we\u2019ll \u2013 next week, we\u2019ll give you the \u2013 all the puts and takes between those trends and we\u2019ll paint a clearer picture at that point.",

It \u2013 the longer-term growth rates are really we\u2019re speaking to how things are going to grow over the next three and five and 10 years. And that higher confidence comes from the higher semiconductor content growth that we\u2019re seeing particularly in industrial and automotive. And the fact that that those two markets now make up two-thirds of our revenue. So just as that structurally grows faster than the rest of the market, we\u2019re convinced more than ever that that will continue to drive our top line and also the products that we have inside of those markets. And I\u2019d say also the strong customer response we\u2019re getting to our geopolitically dependable capacity. So since we\u2019ve shared publicly our plans last February in capital management call, I just say that, that the response has been very, very strong. So those are really the three things that are adding to our confidence. You have a follow-up?",

And then maybe spend a little bit of time on the mix. I know there\u2019s still shortages out there. How do you think \u2013 how long do you think it\u2019ll take to, I guess, balance out your inventory this year to achieve some sort of ideal mix?",

          "content": "Yes. So let me take that. And first, big picture let me point you to our scorecard. The one that we used for capital management when we talked about the objectives in \u2013 when it comes to inventory is to maintain high levels of customer service, keeping stable lead times while minimizing inventory obsolescence, our strategy and our portfolios such that it\u2019s long-lived a very diverse, our customer base. So the risk of obsolescence is very low. So that\u2019s a part of the equation. And the other part is the upside that we get by having that inventory both short-term and long-term to support customers. So that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable holding higher levels of inventory. I\u2019ve been talking about from current levels we could add a $1 billion to $2 billion of additional inventory. And the timing, that all depends on revenue trends. So if they\u2019re higher, then it\u2019ll take longer. If those serving trends are a little weaker, then it\u2019ll be a little faster to get there. On the mix is a number of angles on that, chip stock versus finished goods, we have a mix of both of those. In some cases, it makes sense to have more of one than the other, but they\u2019re both very low risk. So that\u2019s how we think about it.",

And so pricing just to comment on that, I\u2019d say that there\u2019s nothing unusual going on with pricing. As you know, pricing doesn\u2019t move quickly in our markets, our practices and pricing though I know that they\u2019ve changed with many of our peers, our practices have not changed. We just continue to price aggressively in the marketplace, but pricing isn\u2019t the reason why customers choose our product.

So I would say that there\u2019s not much changed in that. And oftentimes if customers aren\u2019t canceling orders, what they\u2019re doing is rescheduling them back out in time.

The margins are quite a bit lower than in early 2021 on quite a bit more revenue. I guess, is that all just still supply chain related costs? And do we get that back at some point? And then on share, just in that same point, the share, we don\u2019t know what the \u2013 all of the calendar fourth quarter looks like, but it\u2019s pretty clear that the share is going to be down about 150 basis points this year, and you\u2019re kind of back to 2012 levels. So I just wonder kind of what\u2019s going on there? Is there some pricing issue that might explain why that share would be down so much? Thanks, Dave. And then I have a follow up.",

So anything you\u2019re seeing in analog is what you\u2019re seeing at the company level. And when it comes to gross profit, we\u2019re very pleased with the results you came in about as expected. And decreases, as we said in the prepared remarks, it decreased primarily due to lower revenue, the transition of LFAB-related cost to a cost of revenue, as well as the cost related to increased investments over the last several quarters that are now flowing through the P&L. And those are long-term investments that are going to position us very well for top-line growth for many, many years to come. And on this, the second part of the question, I think Dave already answered, you go to look at this over a long time, not any one quarter and particularly during choppy times.

I\u2019d say that as we \u2013 you almost have to go back to the beginning of the pandemic and how revenues behaved as we went through first quarter and into second and third. And if you remember, as the pandemic spread in third quarter, we saw wide and very deep cancellations across all of the markets including automotive. But as we all went home to set up our home offices, we either bought a new monitor or a printer or PC. So very quickly our personal electronics customers came back and came back very strong if you remember. The other markets began to follow, but automotive was the last to respond. And people early in the pandemic weren\u2019t shopping for cars, they weren\u2019t going out of the house. So they had that issue. And as manufacturers tried to reopen, they had more issues with COVID protocols and working to bring their plans back online. So it\u2019s not too surprising that there as an asynchronously came out. It\u2019s asynchronously going down. So \u2013 but all these markets we believe over the long term will behave the same. And at some point we believe that we will see a correction in automotive. It may not, but we don\u2019t \u2013 we just don\u2019t know. And we\u2019ll continue to ship product to customer demand. It\u2019s obviously very strong. There\u2019s lots of reasons why besides us gaining share, there\u2019s more content, there\u2019s mix and other factors inside of that. But clearly there\u2019s inventory built across all markets. It\u2019s inclusive of automotive. So do you have a follow-up?",

The other long-term assets that is up to 1.1 billion. You can see the increase year-on-year, that\u2019s the 400 \u2013 that\u2019s what a 400 million receivable is for that ITC. If we had not taken the ITC, that $400 million would have gone to property, plant and equipment. So you can see property, plant and equipment $6.9 billion that would have been $7.3 billion. So instead on a long-term asset, a receivable therefore it's not going to depreciate that $400 million doesn't appreciate because it's not part of PP&E, and eventually, we'll get the cash. Now to your question right now, based on our interpretation of the law, we're not going to get that cash until late 2024. And then every year, it will be like one-year in areas, right? You get a kind of one-year late, but that could change. Clearly, that's something that companies are advocating forward to get that cash early. But right now, we're not planning to get that until 2024. So again, that's how you see it on the balance sheet, lower PP&E. You see a receivable instead. Then because of lower PP&E, you have lower depreciation over the life of the asset and then the receivable because the receivable venture, you get the cash, so it goes from a receivable to the cash line, right? And then eventually, we return it to the owners of the company or use it for other \u2013 for the corporate core business. Hopefully, that answers your question.",

The R&D, clearly that\u2019s where we get the, continue to build on the broad portfolio. That\u2019s where we have process technology and that we get results over many, many years into the future. And we\u2019re going to protect those investments. But it\u2019s not just R&D, even in SG&A we have areas that are tied to capabilities. TI.com is the best example. That\u2019s another place where we\u2019re investing, and that\u2019s tied to a long-term top line growth of the company to be strengthening the reach of channels advantage, you could add CapEx to that picture. That\u2019s also obviously a long-term investment to strengthen our manufacturing and technology advantage. If you look at the, over the last four or five years, our OpEx, so R&D and SG&A, they\u2019ve been at a very steady $3.2 billion for like four or five years. This year for the first time, we picked that up to $3.4 billion. So we went up a little bit as we increased investments. And actually that was an impact on due to inflation, which we\u2019re not immune to that, you can expect that to continue increasing a little bit over the, in 2023 and over the next several years as we continue to increase investments. There\u2019s also the inflation component and but big picture, those are great long-term investments that will feel the growth for the company over the next 10 to 15 years.",

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide some insight into first quarter's revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the second quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the first quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.4 billion, a decrease of 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 14%, embedded processing grew 6%, and our other segment declined 16% from the year-ago quarter. As expected, our results reflect weaker demand in all end markets with the exception of automotive. As mentioned last quarter, a component of the weaker demand was inventory reductions by our customers, which we expect to continue in the second quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by market. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was about flat. The automotive market was up mid-single digits. Personal electronics declined about 30% as we continued to see broad-based weakness. Next, communications equipment was down mid-teens, and finally enterprise systems was down about 30%. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $4.4 billion, down 11% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion, or 65% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit margin decreased 480 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $929 million, up 14% from a year ago, and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.5 billion or 18% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter, or 44% of revenue and was down 25% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guide. Let me now comment on our capital management results. Starting with our cash generation, cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion in the quarter and $7.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $982 million in the quarter and $3.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $4.4 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $100 million of our stock. In total, we have returned $7.5 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.5 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In the quarter, we issued $1.4 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $10.2 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.2%. Inventory dollars were up $531 million from the prior to $3.3 billion and days were 195, up 38 days sequentially. For the second quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.17 billion to $4.53 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.62 to $1.88. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.

Can you just clarify that that's the gross number without any of the tax credits? And I guess assuming that's true, both the CapEx and the depreciation number in the quarter are running well below the run rate there or the annualized number that you would give at the capital management CapEx should have been about $5 billion for the year. Depreciation maybe $1.5 million. So am I right in assuming that implies a fairly substantial ramp into the back half and end of the year for both those metrics, CapEx and depreciation?",

So first on CapEx, we're pleased with the progress that we've made both in 2022 but also year-to-date, first quarter of this year. Everything's in line with expectations as we shared at the call a couple of months ago, we expect CapEx to average $5 billion per year for the next four years. That's just an average. So some years will be lower, especially at the beginning, and other years will be higher. But our expectation continues to be $5 billion per year. Those numbers, that $5 billion is gross. And the $982 million, the one close to $1 billion that you just quoted for the quarter, that's also gross. We are continuing to accrue for the CHIPS Act benefit. I can tell you about that in a follow-up question if you like. But the CapEx numbers have been and will continue to be gross numbers. On the second part of your question on depreciation. So we told you that at the capital management call that depreciation will increase to about $2.5 billion on or around 2025. We expect this year to be below that linear trend. Okay. And that's just the CapEx is coming in as expected, but it's a function of other things. Essentially when you place the equipment in service and when it starts depreciation, the assumptions that we had on that versus how exactly how it's playing out. You have a follow-up?",

You look at the objective there is to maintain high levels of customer service and minimize obsolescence. We have a range there. It's just meant to be informative and it's 132 greater than 200. I just wanted to clarify that versus the number that you mentioned. Now, the more important thing is, you know, I refer you to slide 13 in that deck. And anybody who hasn't seen that, you can download it from our website, go to slide 13. That shows you how we think about planning for the long term. So through semiconductor, the ups and downs of the semiconductor cycle, and that informs how we manage inventory, also informs how we are investing in CapEx. So we're thinking through the cycles over the long term, but certainly inventory is one of those things that we take that trend into account.

Other markets, except for automotive, began to weaken the quarter before last, so we've been experiencing that for a couple of quarters. Automotive has remained strong through last quarter. Therefore, it really depends on which market you're examining. In personal electronics, we're closer to the bottom than to the top.

Throughout each quarter, we were able to respond effectively as customers accelerated their orders. This likely helped our numbers when compared to the broader industry. Moving into the next year, we anticipate these comparisons will be more challenging. However, we have implemented several practices that distinguish us from our competitors. For instance, during that time, we moved towards closer direct relationships with our customers, allowing us better insight into their demand both in the short term and long term. Additionally, as many of our customers reduced their inventory to match their needs, we introduced long-term sales agreements and non-cancelable contracts to ensure they only take what they truly need. This approach isn't about gaining market share artificially; rather, we aim to make doing business with us as seamless as possible. We believe these practices will position us well to continue gaining share. Thank you, Tim. Let's move on to the next caller.",

However, in any given quarter, even when comparing year-over-year, especially in terms of sequential changes in revenue, this may not be very precise. But over a longer time frame, it tends to work well. As we discussed earlier, depreciation plays a role. In this quarter, we need to account for costs related to restructuring in Lehi that are now reflected mainly in the cost of revenue. Other factors also come into play; for example, if a quarter sees a higher mix of industrial automotive products and fewer personal electronics, this will impact the margins. Additionally, depreciation does not immediately affect the profit and loss statement because it is matched with inventory first, which can delay its impact on gross margin. It's clear that depreciation is on the rise, so we should consider this over a longer period\u2014across multiple quarters or years\u2014when talking about fall-through and the increasing depreciation.",

In our capital management document, we've mentioned that we're anticipating benefits from the tax credit and accruing those. However, we are not counting on the grant since it is highly discretionary and dependent on the Department of Commerce. We are applying for those grants and submitting applications for as much as possible, but we're not relying on them at this moment.  Focusing on the investment tax credit, which we are accounting for on the balance sheet, we accrued an additional $200 million benefit this past quarter, adding to the approximately $400 million accrued last year. This brings our total accrued benefit to $600 million, and this amount will continue to grow throughout the year, representing 25% of qualifying assets in the United States. We benefit in two main ways: first, the profit and loss accrual reduces our property, plant, and equipment basis, leading to lower depreciation going forward. We're already experiencing a small benefit this year, though only a couple of million dollars, which will increase as the equipment is placed in service and depreciated at a lower rate. More significantly, the cash benefits associated with this will be realized in the following year. Thus, any accruals from this year that are placed in service in 2023 will provide cash at the end of 2024. This is what we are planning on, and I believe that answers your question well.",

Therefore, a $1 billion quarterly rate aligns with a $4 billion annual projection, suggesting a range of $4 billion to $5 billion for this year, consistent with our expectations. Regarding depreciation, we previously indicated it might increase to $2.5 billion in 2025. However, we expect that trend for this year to be below linear, predicting a smaller increase than $500 million compared to our starting point from 2022. I think Ambrish has the specific number on that, which we are not disclosing right now, but we reported $265 million for this quarter compared to $249 million in the previous quarter.

Many smaller competitors in China lack this reach and the diverse portfolio that draws in customers and enhances our insights. Finally, our diversity and longevity mean we are not reliant on a single market or technology for growth. We depend on all of them, and while it may sometimes favor one competitor over another in the short term, we believe that competing across all markets will result in long-term, reliable market share gains.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the third quarter of 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, an increase of 3% sequentially and a decrease of 13% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 18%, Embedded Processing grew 9%, and our other segment declined 10% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, we experienced continued weakness across all markets except Automotive. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the Industrial market was about flat. Next, the automotive market was up low-single digits. Personal Electronics was up low-single digits after several quarters of sequential declines. And next, communications equipment was down mid-teens, and finally, Enterprise Systems was down mid-single digits. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone. As Dave mentioned, second quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 13% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.9 billion or 64% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, increased capital expenditures, and the transition of LFAB-related charges to cost of revenue. Gross profit margin decreased 540 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $938 million, up 12% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12 months basis, operating expenses were $3.6 billion or 19% of revenue. Operating profit was $2 billion in the quarter or 44% of revenue and was down 28% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.7 billion or $1.87 per share. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in the quarter and $7.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in the quarter and $4.2 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $3.2 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $80 million of our own stock. In total, we have returned $6.5 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $500 million of debt and issued $1.6 billion of debt. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory dollars were up $441 million from the prior quarter to $3.7 billion and days were 207, up 12 days sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $4.36 billion to $4.74 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.68 to $1.92. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are Manufacturing and Technology, a broad product portfolio reach of our channels, and diverse and long-live positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocations and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

I had a high-level question which is when I compare TI's sales growth right down almost 13%, 14% in the near-term down double-digit versus peers, it's significantly below, and when I look at your trailing 12-month free cash flow of sub-17%, if my model is right that is the lowest since 2010. But what point will TI say that something needs to change in the strategy to help close the gap on the growth side and to help free cash flow margins get back to the trend line? So I understand that obviously you're not optimizing the model for just one year, but now we have seen just consistent decline in free cash flow per share, which is your preferred metric. So at what point should we start to see free cash flow get back to historical trends?",

But big picture step back to what we told you during capital management and the investments that we're making are long-term in nature as you alluded to in your question. And we are going to enable revenue growth for the company for the next 10 to 15 years. Okay. So that's how we're thinking about it. And that's why we're making this investment on CapEx, in particular, about $5 billion per year for the next four years, and we are committed to those investments. We're excited about making those investments regardless of the short-term fluctuations of revenue and of course lower revenue means lower operating cash, which now with the CapEx, that's why you're seeing the free cash flow is not unexpected.",

These CapEx investments are really reinforcing that advantage over time. It's clear that these investments will enable us to produce products at significantly lower costs to meet demand, and managing those assets is increasingly important in today\u2019s environment. Customers can see the investments we\u2019re making, along with the other systems we\u2019ve implemented to make it easier to do business with us. We\u2019re also building inventory to support their growth, and customer feedback has been extremely positive. We believe these will be fantastic long-term investments for all of us.

And with respect, I mean, TI had the same strategy two or three years ago also, but we saw sales grow worse than peers last year and sales are again growing worse than peers this year, so it's not one quarter or two-quarter phenomena, sales have been undergrowing your peer growth for almost two years now and CapEx is growing while sales are declining.

I think that depending on the peer you're comparing to, oftentimes the market exposure can explain a good portion of it. There's other factors like how much distribution someone is using. As you know, we've transitioned from mostly using distribution to mostly having revenue come direct. So there is inventory that needed to be burned out of the channel as we made that transition. So there are multiple factors. I think going forward, our confidence in being able to continue to gain share is extremely high. Customer reaction to the capacity that they know they need to have wanting to know that they've got capacity runway not from someone's manufacturing supplier, but directly from someone that makes their products resonates really well with customers.",

We had PE weakened back in the second quarter a year ago and the other markets followed, but obviously, the exception of that with automotive continued to be strong and it's up over 20% year-on-year.

That shows the semiconductor cycle over many years of about 30 some years and what that informs us on what could happen in the future and we're planning for the long-term growth through those cycles, not in any one quarter or even any one year.

On capacity, we are adding resources that will support us for many years, providing ample headroom. Regarding inventory, for those who might not have listened to us often, our inventory has very low obsolescence risk.

Given all the capacity you're adding in the inventory, can we pretty much say that TI lead times are the lowest, at least among peers and the shortages are all gone?

While we will always have some areas with demand and supply imbalances, those gaps are closing rapidly.

And I'll point out the fact that when we opened up our Fab 1, we had 75% of the tools needed inside of that factory, and there was handwringing back then if you remember that we were going to do something unnatural.

Additionally, this seems to align with broader industry trends, as indicated by the SIA data.

Our confidence that that business will grow and gain market share over the long term is extremely high, based on that. And as we've talked about before, we're putting in place to be able to support that growth for embedded internally, and that is a position that we haven't been in quite some time. Near term, I would say, besides things stabilizing, we've experienced greater supply constraints over the last two years is embedded, has previously had to rely on foundries to supply that demand.

However, the equipment often lasts much longer than five years; we have factories that have been operational for over 50 years, some with upgraded equipment. Therefore, it's not entirely fair to compare the 300 million benefit directly with depreciation and expect an immediate offset. Instead, consider it from a cash perspective. We are investing capital expenditure, which is cash, and we should set aside consideration of depreciation at this stage. This investment will support growth by increasing our internal capacity, which, as previously mentioned, is a geopolitically reliable capacity. We are establishing multiple facilities, including four Fabs in Sherman, two in Richardson, and two in Lehi in Utah, along with assembly test facilities in Asia, particularly in Malaysia and the Philippines. This will position us strongly to grow our top line for a significant period. As a result, this expansion will generate substantial operating cash that we can either reinvest or distribute to our shareholders after making these investments.",

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates: First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I'll provide insight into third quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for our fourth quarter 2023. Starting with a quick overview of the third quarter: Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.5 billion, flat sequentially and a decrease of 14% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 16%, Embedded Processing grew 8%, and our Other segment declined 32% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by market. During the quarter, automotive growth continued and industrial weakness broadened. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-single digits, with weakness broadening across nearly all sectors. The automotive market continued to grow and was up mid-single digits. Personal electronics was up about 20% off of a low base. And next, communications equipment was down upper teens. And finally, enterprise systems grew upper-single digits. Given where the market is right now, it is a good time to remind everyone of our plan and areas of strategic investment. First, our confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content per system, especially in industrial and automotive, remains high, and we are well positioned in these markets. Second, our long-term 300 millimeter manufacturing roadmap provides our customers with geopolitically dependable capacity. To support these buildouts and enable future growth, we continue to expect associated capital expenditures to be about $5 billion per year through 2026. In addition, we made good progress on our inventory replenishment, consistent with our long-term objectives to support growth and provide high levels of customer service. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. Third quarter revenue was $4.5 billion, down 14% from a year ago. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.8 billion, or 62% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion and reduced factory loadings. As a reminder, LFAB-related charges transitioned to cost of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit margin decreased 690 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $923 million, up 7% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 20% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.9 billion in the quarter, or 42% of revenue, and was down 29% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the third quarter was $1.7 billion, or $1.85 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.5 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $6.5 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in the quarter and $4.9 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.6 billion. In the quarter, we paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased about $50 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 5%, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. This action reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time. In total, we have returned $5.6 billion in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.9 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $3.9 billion, and days were 205, down two days sequentially. Inventory was up $179 million in the third quarter, less than half the increase versus the prior quarter, as we near our desired inventory levels. Therefore, we began to lower factory starts in the third quarter, which results in additional charges to the income statement. This impact is reflected in our outlook. For the fourth quarter we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.93 billion to $4.27 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.35 to $1.57 as we continue to operate in a weak environment. Lastly, we continue to expect our 2023 effective tax rate to be about 13% to 14%. As you are looking at your models for 2024, based on current tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about what it is in 2023. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

Let me go through some of what I said for the third quarter, which applies for the fourth quarter and beyond. So for the third quarter, like I said in the prepared remarks, in the third quarter gross profit decreased primarily due to revenue, so that\u2019s the first driver. Then, to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansion, namely depreciation is the main one there, and reduced factory loadings, and that's the underutilization component. Then as I also said in the prepared remarks, inventory, which is the other side of the coin, as we near desired levels of inventory, we will begin lowering factory starts in the third quarter. So there was an impact in the third quarter due to that on the income statement. There will be a bigger impact in the fourth quarter due to that. Beyond that, we're not forecasting, but of course that will depend on revenue expectations well into next year. Do you have a follow-up?",

Those larger customers tend to be biased to more consignment. So we would have that probably more in automotive than if I contrast it to a market perhaps like industrial. But overall, as you know, we've moved to having closer direct relationships with customers, which would include the customers that we have in automotive. And I think we service pretty close to 1,000 or so different automotive OEMs, so there is quite a bit of broadness in who we serve there. You have a follow on, Tim?",

And to provide us the ability to grow at that 10% growth rate that we talked about at the last capital management call, if the market requires that, we'll continue to make those investments. So we continue to expect $5 billion of CapEx per year in 2023, 2024, 2025, and 2026. So you should count on that. Let me also give everyone, as a reminder, these CapEx numbers are gross, meaning they do not include benefits from the ITC or grants from the CHIPS Act. So we're actively working through the grant application process with the CHIPS program office, which we believe will be meaningful to our manufacturing operations in Texas and Utah and will help support semiconductor growth for decades to come.

I think many of us have been picking up evidence of the pricing environment, particularly in Asia, intensifying over the past couple of months or a couple of quarters. You don't really give pricing as a reason for gross margins to be down sequentially and year-over-year, but what kind of role is pricing playing? Has your strategy changed at all, whether it be on the analog side or MCU side?",

First, I'll just start with pricing doesn't move quickly in our markets, nor is it a primary reason that customers choose our products. So we're typically agreeing to pricing that's out six months or on an annual basis for the following year. And so, we're continuing to move through that. Our pricing strategy, as we mentioned before, hasn't changed. So we're regularly monitoring what's going on with pricing. We always have a goal to remain competitive. And certainly, supply and demand has come into balance, or closer to balance. We've said for some time that we would expect that pricing to behave like it has over the last couple of decades, meaning, low single-digit decline. So as we move out in time, that's what we're beginning to see. So really no changes other than going back to what we've seen over the last couple of decades. You have a follow on?",

          "content": "Yes. No, thanks for the question. I'll address both OpEx and depreciation. So on OpEx, we've held a steady hand on OpEx for many years and we'll continue to do so. So as an example, to illustrate the point, from 2017 to 2021 we ran at about $3.2 billion of OpEx. And then in 2022, it ticked off to $3.4 billion. And now we're running at about $3.7 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. So you can see the steady hand and just a bit of an increase over the last few years. And that's, as we have had a steady hand with our hires, new college hires, and as we make investments to continue to strengthen the company in the case of R&D, the broad portfolio in the case with sales and TI.com on the reach of our channels. Then on depreciation, so our CapEx expansions are unchanged. We talked about that, addressed it with previous callers. So $5 billion of CapEx per year for the next 2023 and three years beyond that, as we have been talking about. Now when it comes to depreciation, as time has passed, we have more clarity on what to expect on depreciation. So for fourth quarter, let me start fourth quarter of 2023, we expect depreciation to increase on a quarterly basis at about the same rate as what we have been seeing throughout 2023. So essentially, we're going to end the year just shy of $1.2 billion, maybe somewhat in that range for the year. As an update for 2024, we expect depreciation to be between $1.5 and $1.8 billion, and for 2025 to be between $2 billion and $2.5 billion.",

I want to clarify my understanding: I thought we were preparing for an upturn by building inventory, which you've mentioned over several quarters. While you mentioned there's no specific target, you did indicate an increase in the desired level of inventory. Is it correct that you're taking an underutilization charge because you've achieved this inventory level?

For instance, out of the 80,000 products we offer, the majority are catalog items, meaning they are sold to numerous customers and have a long shelf life. This allows us to maintain several years' worth of inventory both at the chip level and in finished goods, based on our internal processes. Collectively, our inventory has reached between $4 billion and $4.5 billion, which we've been guiding toward. However, it's crucial to focus on the specific levels of individual parts. As we approach those target inventory levels, our inventory has grown by approximately $500 million each quarter for two quarters, followed by an increase of $179 million in the most recent quarter. There is clearly a slowdown in this growth on purpose, as we have reduced factory starts, primarily affecting our fabrication but also our assembly test operations. This slowdown will continue into the fourth quarter. The downside of reducing factory output is the underutilization charges. As we get closer to our inventory goals, we are preparing for the next phase of growth. Capacity is the bigger issue, but we've been actively addressing it for several years and investing in our capabilities. Inventory serves as a bridge until we can ramp up factory production again.",

The one thing that is unique, of course, with the cycle is how the markets have behaved differently. We've seen bifurcation and really lined up very well with when markets recovered. So PE was the first to recover and was very strong early on. The other markets followed very shortly after that, and Automotive was last. As you remember, many automotive manufacturers struggled to restart their factories and people weren't going to showrooms when we were in the midst of the pandemic. So really, as we've seen things begin to roll over, Personal Electronics was first. It was then followed by the other markets, and yet we still have automotive that's hanging in there. So I think that's the one thing that's unique. And I think as we've learned and studied the cycles, our product portfolio has changed as well over time. But the best time to be preparing for the upturn is before it shows up. So that's what we've been busy doing, and we think we're in a great position to support the next upturn and to continue to gain share. So, thank you, Ambrish. We'll go to the next caller, please.",

It's not only received but installed and then qualified, and that\u2019s when depreciation starts. So that doesn't happen immediately.

It starts with revenue; you should estimate the revenue expected over the next several years. Although it can be done quarterly, it\u2019s generally more effective to consider a longer timeframe. You begin with revenue and then apply a range of 70% to 75%, which reflects the reliable capacity we are establishing, along with the new 300-millimeter fab capacity that offers a structural cost advantage. We\u2019re also benefiting from ITC and grant incentives in the United States. After applying that range, you need to factor in the added depreciation. This year, it\u2019s likely to be around $1.2 billion, and for next year, it's projected at $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which gives you the added depreciation for 2024. That's the overview, but within any quarter or year, there are adjustments to consider. Currently, we are facing underutilization, which is a headwind now, but it can turn into a tailwind as we ramp up loadings in the future. This is more of a tactical consideration that shifts from quarter to quarter. I hope that addresses your question.",

When production is below what is deemed normal utilization, you calculate the percentage of that shortfall, which is generally established based on wafer starts and the output from assembly test operations compared to maximum capacity. You determine a normal utilization level, which could be around 85%, 90%, or 95%, depending on the situation. When production falls below this level, the shortfall percentage translates into fixed costs that are immediately recognized in the profit and loss statement rather than being added to inventory. These fixed costs can include depreciation, but also other expenses like electricity, which remains constant regardless of production levels. Therefore, this impacts the financials directly without generating revenue. Essentially, it is reflected as a charge in the profit and loss statement for the quarter since that portion of capacity is idle. However, this situation also presents significant operating leverage when production ramps up, as fixed costs do not increase. Consequently, from a cash flow perspective, once production increases, there is a substantial benefit as revenue grows, especially with efficient 300-millimeter capacity at a low cost.",

The strongest signal that we get is orders from customers. Now as we talked about earlier comms, or a market like Personal Electronics was the first market to go into the downturn. We've had a couple of quarters of growth inside of that market. Now it's up off of a very weak base. But we are seeing that as a trend. If you compare that to the industrial market, we had seen that, let's say, let's call it, about half of the sectors begin to weaken a couple of quarters ago, it was really this quarter that we saw that, that weakness broadening. So customers, we believe, inside of markets like that, inside of markets like Comms equipment, that we said they're adjusting their inventories as such.

We began to see that capacity begin to free up for us. And I think that it was different because we had capacity in place to service analog, our own capacity there overall. So, yes. So again, we think that business long term is going to be a great driver for us in the future. So thank you. And I think we've got time for one more caller.",

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Financial Officer Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I'd like to provide some information that's important for your calendars. Next week, on Thursday, February 1, at 10 a.m. Central Time, we'll have our Capital Management Call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Rafael and I will summarize our progress and provide some insight into our business and our approach to capital allocation as we prepare for the opportunity ahead. Moving on, today we'll provide the following updates. First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next I'll provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. I'll then provide an annual summary of revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2024. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter. Revenue is $4.1 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 13% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue declined 12% year-over-year and embedded processing declined 10%. Our other segment declined 25% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. Our results reflect increasing weakness in industrial and a sequential decline in automotive as customers work to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it's more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down mid-teens as we saw that increasing weakness. The automotive market was down mid-single-digits after 3.5 years of very strong growth. Personal electronics was about flat. And next, communications equipment was down low-single-digits. And lastly, enterprise systems grew low single digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market. As a percentage of revenue for 2023, industrial was 40%; automotive was 34%; personal electronics 15%; communications equipment 5%; enterprise systems 4%; and other was 2%. In 2023, industrial and automotive combined made up 74% of TI's revenue, up about 9 percentage points from 2022, and up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our industrial and automotive customers are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technologies to make their end products more reliable, more affordable, and lower in power. These trends have resulted and will continue to result in growing chip content per application, which will drive faster growth compared to our other markets. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned fourth quarter revenue was $4.1 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.4 billion or 60% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, higher manufacturing costs associated with planned capacity expansions, and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 650 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $898 million, up 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 21% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.5 billion in the quarter or 38% of revenue. Operating profit was down 30% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.49 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.9 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $65 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter, marking our 20th consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $4.9 billion in the past 12 months to owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $11.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.5%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4 billion, up $91 million from the prior quarter and days were 219, up 14 days sequentially. Now let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2023 cash flow from operations was $6.4 billion. Capital expenditures were $5.1 billion. Free cash flow for 2023 was $1.3 billion or 8% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model, as well as our decisions to invest in 300 millimeter manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.16. We now expect our 2024 effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

Still, I'm a little bit surprised with the year-over-year drop through, if you will? Gross margin dollars essentially dropping as much as your revenue. I understand the underutilization, the increase in depreciation. But what are you seeing from a pricing perspective? Is it more pricing than volume that's driving the revenue decline and the decline in gross margins? Or if you can kind of speak to your strategy from a pricing perspective, what you're seeing in the marketplace? That would be helpful. Thank you.",

So and as we've mentioned before our pricing strategy hasn't changed and of course, we're always regularly monitoring the market and pricing our products appropriately. And as we've talked about now for I think a couple of quarters, as we expected supply and demand to come more in balance, that we would expect pricing to revert back to how it's behaved over the last 10 or 20 years. And over the last six months or so, that's what we've seen. So somewhat of a low-single-digit decline is what we're expecting out in time and wouldn't describe that as unusual.

Even if I strip out depreciation, it's down about 100 basis points for March. So it seems like utilization is coming down a bit. And CapEx also came in a little bit lower too for December. So the first question on that is, can you talk about loadings? Is March going to be the bottom in loadings and we should see inventory begin to come down also in March?

The fourth quarter adjustment was bigger than the third quarter. And now going into the first quarter, we're taking that adjustment further. So the first quarter adjustment on underutilization will be bigger. But we continue to have an upward bias on inventory as we continue to build the right buffers for the right parts to be ready on the other side of the cycle. So, follow-up?",

So that's in the ballpark, and we just finished just shy of $4 billion. But as far as when underutilization bottoms, that's going to depend on revenue expectations. And at this point, we're only, as always, we only give one quarter at a time. So we'll see where we are 90-days from now and we'll tell you about that.",

I would say that the demand signals that we get from customers are orders that they place, whether that's either directly or through consignment feeds. So that's the data that we can see. We actually can't see their inventory levels. We can anecdotally, as we see a market like personal electronics is down 30%, 40%. We know handsets and PCs, that market hasn't gone down as much as that. So we know anecdotally that we're shipping below demand. So we believe that, that's what's going on in industrial. We have customers who have told us that they have built inventory and plan to correct that. So having a real clear picture of what their demand looks like and their channel inventories look like isn't something that we can see directly overall. So and the comment on automotive, we know that customers there did want to build inventory. And we believe that they're in a good position now, so it wasn't surprising that we saw a sequential decline there. So thanks, Chris, we\u2019ll go to the next caller please.",

That's one, Dave alluded to earlier, that's one set of targets that we have. That's at the finished goods level. Remember, we have 100,000 different parts, and the vast majority of those are what we call catalog, which means they sell to many, many customers. So we want to build a certain finished good level for each one of those parts. But we're also building at the chip level. Think of a chip can go into two, three, 10 different finished goods so it works out well to have some chip level inventory operationally, but you also have want to have finished goods.

The second consideration is that embedded relies on foundry wafer supply more heavily. Most of our analog businesses done internally. So there the constraints lasted longer and have now been resolved and are behind us, so that created some of the lag between there as well. So, and as you know, our CapEx plans and spend will have more of our wafers overall built internally, which is inclusive of embedded. You have a follow-on?",

You know, what all cycles are the same and they're all different right as we've all studied them over time. What's clearly different this time is how the markets have behaved in the bifurcation. We saw personal electronics begin to weaken second quarter a year ago and automotive you know just we saw the sequential decline this last quarter. So in the other markets somewhere in between. So and then in addition I think that, you know, we've had lots of other noise that's inside of the system, whether that's been pricing, as you mentioned. We've had non-cancellable, non-rescheduled orders and other longer-term contracts that have required customers to take product that they don't need, whether companies are using distributors more heavily than others. So all of that adds noise into it. So I think we just need to let that noise wring itself out over the cycle. And what we're focused on, of course, is investing in our competitive advantages, getting stronger. We believe that we're in a great position to continue to gain share over the long term.",

So the ITC investment tax credit 25% credit on CapEx or manufacturing in the United States. We have accrued to-date over the last year and a half or so $1.4 billion. We expect to get about $500 million of that later this year, probably in the fourth quarter as far as the current law and regulations stipulate. And we'll get the rest further down the road, mostly the following year and then after that. And we'll continue to accrue that benefit, just again, 25% on anything we spend in the United States for manufacturing. That's the cash side and the balance sheet. On the P&L, we're already seeing the benefit as lower depreciation. That benefit tends to be small, has been small so far because for example, some of that is for buildings that haven't even started to depreciate, but it will build up over time on that front. So that's the ITC. The grants, we submitted our application for those in December. And at this point, we will wait to hear from the Department of Commerce and see what happens there.",

But big picture understand and look at the operating cash, even in a depressed environment with the revenue, depressed operating cash flow is very strong. We also have very strong balance sheet. And we just finished the year at $8.6 billion. You know, when it comes to repurchases, I would take you to our objectives on capital management for cash return, and our objective is to return all free cash flow via dividends and repurchases.

Throughout this time, as you pointed out, we will continue to benefit increasingly from 300 millimeter, more 300 millimeter wafers, which have a cost advantage. So, let me go back to the appreciation just to make sure everybody has the right number. It's the same as what I said 90 days ago.

Right now we're just shy of $4 billion as I said earlier on the call. We have continued upward bias for at least one more quarter, probably a couple quarters at least, an upward bias on that. But that is good inventory for catalog parts that sell to many customers that last a long time. So I feel really good about that. But we'll see how things play out on the other side of the cycle and depending on demand and different things. But I would expect to continue holding relatively high levels of inventory. We just in a different position than we were even three or four years ago in terms of how much of our revenue and our parts are in industrial automotive, in catalog type of parts that last a long time. So our strategy is such that it makes sense to have that inventory. Our order fulfillment processes have also improved. We have ti.com and different tools that we can leverage to go direct to market. We have a much higher percent of our revenue now 35% is direct. So all those factors play into having more inventory as a real leverage point that we can use to serve our customers even better.",

And our objective with inventory and the capacity we're putting on place is to have our customer service metrics remain high, which means keeping lead times stable. So you know I think in some markets we've seen customers that have told us that they were planning and have built their capacity and their inventories to grow at 25% in the coming year and they showed up and their plans changed and they're only going to grow 10%, right? So they told us they won't be ordering product for some time as they, you know, equalize those numbers.

Now after that, it's all going to depend on revenue and revenue expectations because of course, depending on what those are in the second-half of the year, let's say 90-days from now, then that will be a big factor in determining how the factories will run. But the bigger picture is, you know, all this deployment of CapEx that we're doing is all on 300 millimeter, which has a 40% cost advantage versus 200 millimeter. Several questions people asked earlier, it has ITC benefits on that. So it's coming in at a 25% discount on the ITC and we'll see how much we get on grants.

This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates: First, I'll start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, I will provide insight into first quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our end-markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management, as well as share the guidance for the second quarter of 2024. Starting with a quick overview of the quarter: Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.7 billion, a decrease of 10% sequentially and 16% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 14% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing declined 22%. Our Other segment declined 33% from the year-ago quarter. Now I'll provide some insight into our first quarter revenue by end-market. Revenue declined sequentially across all of our end-markets. Our results reflect the current environment, as customers continue to reduce their inventory levels. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance, as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down upper-single digits. The automotive market was down mid-single digits. Personal electronics was down mid-teens. Next, communications equipment was down about 25%. And lastly, enterprise systems was down mid-teens. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks Dave, and good afternoon everyone. As Dave mentioned, first quarter revenue was $3.7 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.1 billion, or 57% of revenue. From a year ago, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue and to a lesser extent, higher manufacturing costs associated with reduced factory loadings and our planned capacity expansions. Gross profit margin decreased 820 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $933 million, flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 22% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.3 billion in the quarter, or 35% of revenue, and was down 34% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the first quarter was $1.1 billion or $1.20 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.10 benefit that was not in our original guidance, primarily due to the sale of a property. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion in the quarter and $6.3 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter and $5.3 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $940 million. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends, and in the past 12 months, we returned $4.8 billion to our owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $10.4 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the first quarter. In first quarter, we issued $3 billion in debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14.3 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $84 million from the prior quarter and days were 235, up 16 days sequentially. For the second quarter we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.65 billion to $3.95 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.05 to $1.25. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add-value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad-product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

As we said before, we believe our investments in manufacturing in both Texas and Utah are well-positioned with the objectives of the CHIPS Program Office. Now let me give you an update on the ITC, the Investment Tax Credit. To date, we have accrued about $1.5 billion on that credit, and based on the recently released regulations, we will be receiving the ITC cash benefit throughout the year in 2024 and beyond. And starting next quarter, so in second quarter, we expect to receive about $300 million and a total of $1 billion for all of 2024. Okay, do you have a follow-up?",

If and when revenues begin to recover, how do we think about what that would imply for your factory utilization given your current inventory position, as well as additional capacity coming online, which I guess sort of just naturally gives a downward bias to utilization anyways? Like I guess, how long would you need to take utilizations up? Or how much revenue growth would you need to start taking utilizations up given your positioning on inventories and capacity additions?",

The key takeaway is that we do not anticipate any significant depletion of inventory. Our business model prioritizes keeping lead times short, and the potential benefits of maintaining inventory and capacity far outweigh the risks involved. I hope this provides some clarity on our perspective. Do you have a follow-up?",

We're essentially returning to trends we've observed over the last 10 to 20 years, prior to the pandemic.

First, personal electronics was the initial market to enter the correction phase, and it has now shown more seasonal behavior. On the other hand, the industrial sector has been experiencing a decline sequentially for a while. In recent quarters, we have mentioned the asynchronous behavior within the 12 to 13 sectors we monitor. This trend continued in the last quarter. We still see some of the later-cycle sectors experiencing continued declines at double-digit rates, but there are some sectors that are starting to slow their declines and even a few that showed sequential growth. Therefore, I would characterize the situation this quarter as more mixed, which is certainly a departure from last quarter. Historically, the second quarter is strong seasonally for us, so it's typical for us to see sequential growth. Do you have a follow-up?",

Currently, I estimate that about 10% to 15% of the local semiconductor content is sourced from these suppliers. The specific figure I came across is 12%. This indicates that 88% is sourced from U.S. and European suppliers.

Can you talk about how you think about pricing kind of more strategically as you contemplate having a decent amount of capacity, more 300 millimeter capacity, more subsidization? Does that change the pricing paradigm at all? Are there markets where you might be more price-aggressive than you wouldn't be, if any of that were different?",

You know that pricing doesn't move quickly in our industry, and it isn't the primary reason why customers choose our products overall. So we regularly monitor pricing for all of our products. That includes all end markets and all product categories and all regions. And we price to be competitive, and we can do that because we've got a great product portfolio and we've got great access to the markets through our channels. And we've got competitive products because we build it on 300 millimeter. So hopefully, that's amazingly consistent. Do you have a follow-on?",

We believe there will be persistent trends leading to increased semiconductor demand in the industrial and automotive sectors, which is why we've been increasing our investments in those areas. In contrast, our investments in personal electronics and communications equipment have remained steady because we see strong opportunities in those markets. We will maintain those investments. Additionally, we have slightly increased our investments in enterprise systems, as we anticipate good growth potential in that area as well. While it may not see the same dynamics as industrial and automotive, we believe the components within enterprise will likely achieve above-average growth over the next decade and beyond.

I'm Dave Pahl, Head of Investor Relations, and I'm joined by our Chief Executive Officer, Haviv Ilan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Rafael Lizardi. For any of you who missed the release, you can find it on our website at ti.com/ir. This call is being broadcast live over the web and can be accessed through our website. In addition, today's call is being recorded and will be available via replay on our website. This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete description. Today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he'll provide insight into second quarter revenue results with some details of what we're seeing with respect to our end markets. Lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results, give an update on capital management as well as share the guidance for the third quarter of 2024. With that, let me turn it over to Haviv.",

          "content": "Thanks, Dave. Let me also start by welcoming everyone to the call. I'm looking forward to joining our quarterly earnings calls moving forward and sharing more details about our business strategy with the investment community. It is an opportunity for me to directly share more information about our results and our strategic progress. With that, I'll start with a quick overview of the second quarter. Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $3.8 billion, an increase of 4% sequentially and a decrease of 16% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 11% year-over-year, and Embedded Processing declined 31%. Our other segment declined 22% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end-market. Our results continue to reflect the asynchronous behavior across our end-markets that we've seen throughout this cycle. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the Industrial market was down low-single digits. The Automotive market was down mid-single digits. Personal Electronics grew mid-teens with broad-based growth while demonstrating continued improvement compared to its low point in the first quarter of 2023. Next, Communication Equipment was up mid-single digits. And finally, Enterprise Systems was up about 20%. Lastly, before I pass it on to Rafael, I'd like to share a few comments regarding our capacity investments. We and our customers remain pleased with our progress of the expansion of our 300-millimeter manufacturing capacity. These investments reflect our confidence in the opportunity ahead, which remains high for several reasons. First, we have a high level of confidence in the secular growth of semiconductor content, particularly in industrial and automotive, where we have greater exposure and strong product positions. Second, geopolitically dependable low-cost 300-millimeter capacity will be increasingly critical and valuable, and our investments enable us to support customer demand at scale. To share more details on our progress, which we believe is helpful for all of our shareholders to understand, I plan to hold an off-cycle capital management call with Rafael and Dave on August 20th. During the call, I will provide more granularity on our capacity investments along with the framework of revenue and free cash flow per share scenarios. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, second-quarter revenue was $3.8 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.2 billion or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher revenue as well as lower manufacturing unit costs due to increased factory loadings and more manufacturing internally with more wafers on 300-millimeter. Operating expenses in the quarter were $963 million, up 3% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion, or 23% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.2 billion in the quarter, or 33% of revenue, and was down 37% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the second quarter was $1.1 billion, or $1.22 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.05 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in the quarter and $6.4 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion in the quarter and $5 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.5 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow includes benefits from the CHIPS Act investment tax credit, which was $312 million for the second quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $71 million of our stock. In total, we returned $4.9 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $9.7 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the second quarter. In the quarter, we repaid $300 million of debt. Total debt outstanding is now $14 billion with a weighted-average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.1 billion, up $23 million from the prior quarter and days were 229, down 6 days sequentially. For the third quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.94 billion to $4.26 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.24 to $1.48. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term. With that, let me turn it back to Dave.",

We've started to see these requests coming, I think two or three years ago when tensions started to rise, but as we reflect on it now three years in, it's obvious that there is more and more attention usually at the highest levels of our customers. I'm talking about leadership of CEOs or Chief Purchasing Officers, looking at their supply chains and making sure that they are going to be immune from whatever is thrown at them, part of it is geopolitical tensions. And this is where TI is a great answer. We are a very unique supplier in the sense that we can provide the capacity at scale, meaning the amount of wafers and the size of our capacity that we are building is very high. It is very affordable capacity as building our parts on 300-millimeter wafers allows for a lower cost per chip and then building them internally in our assembly and test houses also provides a very good low-cost structure. And last but not least is this geopolitically dependable capacity, meaning our fabs are being built in the US, mainly in Texas and in Lehi, Utah, and we provide a capacity that is at scale, affordable, and dependable. And yes, every time there is some news out there, we are seeing more interest. We've seen that grow over the last several years, and in that sense, our discussions with our customers are providing us more opportunity to win positions in future platforms. I do believe we are taking a bigger share and this is part of our confidence to continue with our investments to serve that opportunity moving forward. Last but not least, you have touched on China. Yes, you're right. If I take an example, and just on the automotive side, our customers in China do care a lot about their export business. In that sense, our capacity is highly welcomed by them because we can compete at the market price with a very competitive offering, yet have that dependability to serve their customers not only in China but also outside of China for their export business.",

To date, we have accrued about $1.8 billion in total, that's under 25% ITC. This benefit already started flowing through the income statement as lower depreciation. In addition, in the second quarter, we received, as I said in the prepared remarks, $312 million of cash benefits, and that is reflected in operating and free cash flow.

In the second quarter, our results showed a decline of low-single digits in the industrial sector. The automotive segment also experienced a decline in the mid-single digits, marking the third consecutive quarter of such a decrease. However, from a year-over-year standpoint, the decline remains manageable, coming in at about 9% in Q2. On a positive note, we are seeing strength in personal electronics, which faced a downturn throughout the cycle but began to recover in the first quarter of 2023. This market has grown sequentially in the mid-teens and nearly 20% year-over-year, indicating significant growth. Additionally, while the enterprise market represents smaller revenue for us, there is a recovery underway, and I believe we have moved past the inventory correction phase. In terms of our Other business, growth has been driven by the calculator segment, as well as our DLP business that primarily supports personal electronics.

Because every time this question is asked to industries or not just TI, the answer is always that, well, the IP is not there, they don't have product breadth and whatnot, but they're still buying a lot of trailing edge equipment.

It was a strong quarter for our China business, with our headquarters operations increasing by about 20% sequentially compared to the first quarter. We observed positive momentum across all five markets, each growing sequentially by about 15% to 20%, which is notable following seven quarters of decline. The China market has been influenced by all end-markets for TI, and it took seven quarters for this asynchronous cycle to manifest, beginning with Personal Electronics, then extending to Industrial and Enterprise, and slightly to Automotive. All of these segments have now stabilized, making Q2 a successful quarter for us. I believe we are now aligned with end demand, indicating that customers have ceased managing their inventories. Regarding competition in China, it's important to acknowledge that this is not new; competition has significantly intensified over the past few years and continues to strengthen. It's a misconception to think that competitors are only dealing in simple products; they are ambitious and well-educated. My message to the TI team is to compete effectively. While the market in China is indeed more competitive, I am confident that we can compete and secure business at attractive margins.

We can see what's happening with our inventories and our position. So as we've talked about, cancellations as an example, as a measure have continued to come down. Our lead times I described are very stable. We've got immediate availability of almost all of our products. So that does drive a lower visibility with backlog because customers can get product when they need it. We do believe that some markets PE bottomed back in the first quarter of 2023 and has been more seasonal since then. We've seen some of the other markets that as we've shared earlier, are beginning to grow. So there's likely a bottom forming within some of those markets. We've got industrial and automotive that have continued to decline. Now I'd say with industrial, I mentioned earlier, some of the sectors are forming a bottom, while others are continuing to decline.

On top of it, as we said earlier, customers do want and value geopolitically dependable capacity. So we are pleased with our progress. Our CapEx strategy provides us both with capacity for growth and flexibility. At the end of the day, CapEx supports revenue growth and need to be prepared for different scenarios. Now, we always continue to evaluate our plans and investments based on what we see on the demand environment, the dynamics, and the growth opportunities in the market. To talk more about it, as I said in my prepared remarks, we are going to have our off-cycle capital management call in a month, in four weeks, just an opportunity to share just additional insight. So we'll go through our investment plan with more granularity on what exactly we are doing per factory and then we'll provide a framework of revenue scenarios and what would free cash flow per share and CapEx do, you know, versus each and every scenario.

Of course, in any given quarter or year, there may be fluctuations, such as utilization or factory loadings, which can sometimes affect our results positively or negatively. However, generally speaking, you can expect that fall-through to be between 75% and 85%, not accounting for depreciation.

Regarding the market cycle, the embedded segment has a different structure than analog, primarily focusing on industrial and automotive sectors, which means it has less exposure to personal electronics, enterprise, or communication equipment. These markets peaked later, with the embedded business starting its recovery in the middle of 2023, a year after the analog business. Additionally, while there have been changes, the embedded business relied heavily on foundry wafers during the upcycle, leading to more limitations compared to our internal supply capacity. As these supply issues are resolved, we see customers adjusting their inventory, which has contributed to a sharper correction in the embedded segment.

Yes, year-to-date, it's down about as much as your peers, or I would argue slightly better. You've articulated the positive strategy changes previously, right, more catalog, broad market focus. So bottom-line, again, over the past few years, it seems like you've made good improvements in this business. So as the team moves embedded more to internal manufacturing combined with the strategy shift, maybe, Haviv, can you just comment on the design-win momentum? What areas are you particularly doing well in?

But again, as you mentioned, the embedded business has gone through change in the last four or five years, and Amichai has done a great job to position the business such that it benefits our competitive advantages, thinking about manufacturing and technologies of shifting really from almost like 80% external to when done, maybe the opposite, 80% internally, building a higher breadth of products or not less concentration of revenue per socket and us expanding our product portfolio, utilizing the reach of our market channels. Think about the large sales team of TI, think about TI.com, and the more catalog the product, the better fit to our strategy. So in that sense, that is moving well. In terms of design-in momentum, again, it's mainly an industrial and automotive business. So very high visibility on the automotive side. But as you also know, it takes time. I'm encouraged with the design-in momentum. Our funnel increased tremendously when I compare it to the analog side because every funnel of every supplier grows, but we've seen a disproportional growth of our design-in momentum for embedded versus previous year and also versus analog just in terms of the rates. I will give some examples. We see good momentum in real-time control, think about EVs, onboard chargers, think about traction inverters, a very good momentum in connectivity, automotive, and beyond. Think about car entries, tire pressure monitoring, and other and body-related opportunities in the automotive market. I can continue with the kind of our more application-specific products like our radar systems. We have a great position and growing position in radar, winning a lot of new business, both with the Tier-1s and the OEMs. This is from imaging radar for the front to the corner radar to even parking assist and also in-cabin sensing that radar is taking a bigger and bigger part of the automotive market. Many other examples on the industrial side, here the number of end equipment is really vast, hundreds of end equipment. But this is where our catalog MCUs that we are really reviving the presence of TI and building a new portfolio based on our MSP family is doing very well in winning new business and across-the-board, across the markets utilizing our channel advantage.

As you've sort of potentially passed the bottom of sort of the current cycle here, wondering if there's been any notable movement or trends in ti.com.

So in terms of the investment in ti.com, yes, they are continuing. These are very strategic and important investments for us. We believe there is a huge opportunity to digitize what we call the last mile or that interface between us and the customers. There are many customers, still a long tail of customers that we can't see today. But as they move to ti.com, we can supply them with more information, we can even provide an opportunity to place backlog electronically, directly with TI. In that sense, the importance for us is to just know our customers better, understand the end equipment, and provide the relevant product portfolio to serve their growth and win market share, right? So that data is to us very, very important that the direct connectivity with the customer is important. To do just that, we are investing in IT systems. We are investing in warehouses or if you will, logistics to serve these customers just in time as they need it, and that is part of the way customers would opt to TI and just connect directly to us. Now in terms of the short-term, Dave, maybe you can talk a little bit about what we're seeing there through the cycle.",

When they do have a shortage, they can look into our inventory, they can see it, some have even automated that process, and have products shipped in many cases the same day.

For instance, we have modeled the COVID cycle as a comparable scenario and that influences our investments. It is vital to gain an advantage over competitors by servicing customers well during such times, as that presents opportunities for market share growth, and we are preparing for those opportunities. Furthermore, we are building our inventory thoughtfully, ensuring it aligns with our diverse product offering and longevity plans to minimize the risk of excess stock.

There is always going to be that one cycle or that steep cycle that maybe we won't be able to do it. But we have modeled the company in such a way that in most demand situations, we would be able to maintain a good customer or high customer service levels through the cycle, which hopefully will keep the lead times short and which I'm pretty sure will encourage customers not to hoard inventory.

We've seen that spreading through time with the market. If you think about the asynchronous behavior that we have described of the different markets, we saw the same in China. The personal electronics business picked in China somewhere in 2021, enterprise and industrial sometimes in 2022, and then automotive picked sometime in 2023. So, you saw that peak spread over three years, which I think is the reason we saw such an elongated decline of seven quarters in a row, and we went backwards to our history, and it's been one of the longest, if not the longest cycle we have seen. But I can see clearly that it's mainly played out. Of course, we will always find pockets and a few sectors in the industrial market that are still going through that, but it's very clear that once you start to shift to end demand, you will see such behavior of, in our case, 20% sequential growth, and that momentum is being built across the markets. All markets did very well in China, growing between 15% to 20% something percent. Okay? So very robust, coherent and that's like a recovery looks like. Now we haven't seen that across the other markets. I will even tell you that areas like, you know, Europe and Japan are in an early phase and hopefully, it doesn't take seven quarters per geography, but China was kind of the first into the upcycle, the beginning of COVID, the first one to correct on the down and now to me, the first one kind of raising a very strong sequential growth with momentum. So that's the way I would summarize it without trying to imply that we'll see the same behavior in each and every other market.",

Revenue in the quarter came in about as expected at $4.2 billion, an increase of 9% sequentially and a decrease of 8% year-over-year. Analog revenue declined 4% year-over-year and embedded processing declined 27%. Our other segment declined 5% from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our third quarter revenue by end-market. Our results continue to reflect the asynchronous market behavior that we've seen throughout this cycle. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down low-single digits as customers continue to reduce their inventory levels. The automotive market increased upper single digits, primarily due to strength in China. Personal Electronics grew about 30%, Enterprise Systems was up about 20%, and Communication Equipment was up about 25% as the cyclical recovery continued in these three markets. With that, let me turn it over to Rafael to review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, third-quarter revenue was $4.2 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.5 billion or 60% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit margin increased 180 basis points, primarily due to higher revenue. Operating expenses in the quarter were $920 million, about flat from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.7 billion or 24% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.6 billion in the quarter or 37% of revenue and was down 18% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the quarter was $1.4 billion or $1.47 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.03 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in the quarter and $6.2 billion on a trailing 12-month basis. Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion in the quarter and $4.8 billion over the last 12 months. Free cash flow on a trailing 12-month basis was $1.5 billion. As a reminder, free cash flow includes benefits from the CHIPS Act investment tax credit, which was $220 million in the third quarter and $532 million on a trailing 12-month basis. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $318 million of our stock. In September, we announced we would increase our dividend by 5%, marking our 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. This reflects our continued commitment to return free cash flow to our owners over time. In total, we returned $5.2 billion to our owners in the past 12 months. Our balance sheet remains strong with $8.8 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the third quarter. Total debt outstanding is $14 billion with a weighted average coupon of 3.8%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.3 billion, up $190 million from the prior quarter and days were 231, up two days sequentially. For the fourth quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.7 billion to $4 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of $1.07 to $1.29. We continue to expect our effective tax rate to be about 13% in the fourth quarter. As you're looking at 2025, based on current tax law, we would expect our effective tax rate to remain about the same. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long term.

Most of this growth was driven by our business in China. As I mentioned in the second quarter, we observed strength in the automotive sector in China, and this trend continued into the third quarter. To provide some specifics, it grew by 20% in Q2 and another 20% in Q3. It\u2019s not surprising that there's momentum for electric vehicles in China, and our content there is increasing, which really contributed to the growth in the third quarter. I anticipate this momentum will continue; it's not just a one-time occurrence. Our automotive revenue in China has reached an all-time high, and I don\u2019t expect that to decline in the near future. However, the rest of the automotive market is experiencing some challenges. Revenue has been downtrending, despite a slight pick-up in Q3 of 2023. Excluding China, there was a quick correction anticipated in Q4 and Q1, and I expect to see continued weakness in other markets.

What do you attribute this strength in personal electronics to? Do you believe the market has bottomed out from a cyclical perspective?",

So I mean that revenue in the personal electronics market, it peaked in the third quarter of 2021. By the way, the third quarter is typically our peak quarter every year. There is a seasonality strength in every third quarter for PE. And it roughed in the first quarter of 2023. Since then, we have seen continuous improvement. But I will say, Vivek, that when I look at our third quarter of 2024, it's still running at a lower level than the peak. It's running about 20% lower than the 2021 peak. So there is still room to grow. And in our case, as I think I've mentioned in some of the calls, when we were short in with the supply capacity back in 2021, 2022, we had to take some calls where it was to bias our supply towards industrial and automotive. The personal electronics have shorter design cycles. We said we'll go attack that once the capacity and inventory are back in place. That's the case right now. So I think we are coming off of a very low trough, plus again having the right part to go back and win sockets that we couldn't sell before. So that's what I'm seeing right now. In terms of specifically into the third quarter, I think growth was across all the sectors or most of the sectors, the main ones are phones and notebook PCs. But in general, the third quarter, as I've said, is a typical strong quarter for PE.",

And people have kind of rightly then pushed back and said, well, that requires mid-teens sales growth in the next two years, well above the trend line. At what point do you think you will start to see those above seasonal quarters to help us get to that above-trend growth for the next two years. So I understand you're not giving guidance, but what are you seeing in the broader end markets and do you think TI is at a point where those kind of above seasonal quarters are line-of-sight or is it too early to make that judgment?

          "content": "Sure, Vivek. To summarize your question, I believe you are referencing our capital management call from August. I encourage everyone to review the details we shared at that time, particularly the 2026 scenarios we outlined, which range from flat to growth compared to 2018. While we didn't project specific revenue figures, it does offer investors a perspective on free cash flow per share based on different revenue scenarios. This lets you adjust revenue predictions and better understand how free cash flow might respond in a given year.  Specifically addressing your question, we mentioned three markets currently experiencing a cyclical recovery: Personal Electronics, Enterprise Systems, and Communication Systems. These markets are still in recovery but are showing positive momentum, although they account for only about 25% of our revenue in 2023. We truly need the broader industrial and automotive markets to improve as well. Looking at the industrial sector, revenue peaked in the third quarter of 2022, and we've now seen eight consecutive quarters of decline, with revenue over 30% down from that peak. I don't foresee much more decline; hopefully, we are nearing the bottom. The inventory correction is still happening, but I anticipate a recovery, though I cannot accurately predict when that will begin since it often comes as a surprise. Most industrial sectors are either still looking for a bottom or are remaining at very low levels. In the automotive market, the situation is more complex, with a notable difference between China and other regions. China represents about 20% of our business and is not sufficient to significantly impact our overall automotive revenue. Currently, automotive sales are at an upper single-digit percentage, around 5% to 10% below the peak. While China is setting new records and has momentum, other regions are still trying to stabilize. Overall, I expect that when everything aligns, the automotive market will experience a lower peak-to-trough cycle, but I can't provide a specific timeline for that.",

So first, bigger picture and then I'll get into maybe some specifics, but the objective for inventories to support revenue growth as we prepare for the upturn, as Haviv described in our expectations going forward, particularly in 2025. We do expect to grow inventory in the fourth quarter. So we grew a couple of hundred million in the third quarter. We expect probably a few hundred million of inventory growth again in the fourth quarter. But that is, we have moderated the factory loading. So factory loadings expect us to go slightly down going into the fourth quarter, but despite that, we'll still grow additional inventory. Just to comment a little more on the inventory, we have detailed plans by device at the finished goods level, at the chips level, and those plans are grounded on purchasing behavior and expected demand and this inventory is very low-risk. It sells to many, many customers and it has a long life cycle. So we feel really good about that.",

We are running at 45% of the opening and seeing new picks, driven primarily by the China market. Recently, the majority of new cars are electric vehicles or hybrids, which tend to have more content, and our position there is strong. TI is very competitive, which drives that growth. Our customer base in China includes a mix of OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers. While you are experts on the OEM share, the Tier 1s are also building good systems and are cost-efficient with strong performance. They compete effectively for market share against global Tier 1s, which is part of the dynamic we observe in the China market. We see momentum in both areas.",

The behavior across markets is not synchronous, and it's evident that there are differences between regions. As mentioned earlier, there is a notable increase in electric vehicle momentum in China. Additionally, the rapid pace of design cycles and inventory corrections in China contributes to a quicker overall environment. This leads to shorter cycles for both increases and decreases in performance, in my opinion. However, we will only be able to draw smarter conclusions once the situation fully unfolds. I can say that I have not witnessed this scenario fully play out in the automotive market outside of China. But I don't believe the peak-to-trough variation in the automotive market will be as marked as in industrial markets, mainly due to the strong secular growth I see in the short term.",

While it's useful to speculate beyond the data we have, I want to remind you that during the upcycle, we focused our supply on the industrial and automotive sectors. For 2023, the company was around 75% in industrial and automotive. China was similar, possibly even higher, as we had to make some decisions regarding the consumer PE side. Regarding automotive, I can't pinpoint the specific reasons, but it seems that Chinese customers are rapidly progressing and gaining global momentum, not just within China. Additionally, the acceptance of electric vehicles in China is growing, although there might be other factors at play that we haven't clearly identified, like significant inventory increases. Regarding your question about automotive, on the industrial side, we haven't seen a recovery in China yet. The peak occurred around 2022, followed by a slight growth in Q2, but then a decline once again in Q3, leaving us at a low point. We're awaiting a turnaround. While the automotive sector has shown a strong recovery with new highs, industrial numbers are still about 40% or more below the peak in China.

In Factory Automation, particularly in steel, which is a significant sector for us, we are still experiencing a decline and have not yet seen a bottom. However, there are a couple of areas showing strength. Appliances, for instance, while some may not consider it part of industrial as we do, saw an early decline but has shown some recovery. Additionally, in our case with power delivery, which is primarily related to silver, we are seeing growth there. However, these are the only two sectors out of 12 that are performing well.

This team is experiencing a cyclical process similar to what the analog team went through, but they are about a year behind. Currently, embedded is nearly 95% focused on industrial and automotive sectors. They have shown growth in 2023 compared to the industrial business, while the analog business has witnessed double-digit declines. The embedded team started their journey nearly a year after analog, around the middle of 2023. Over the past four quarters, we anticipate a seasonal increase in Q4, and the momentum there is strong, which makes me optimistic about its future.",

I don't think there is a lot of desire to build inventory at our customers' shelves, especially when our inventory position is strong and that's where we want to be.

This suggests there might be some inventory corrections at customer levels, which is part of what I mentioned earlier. However, I see that they've stabilized in terms of revenue.

Our portfolio is largely diverse and long-lasting, and we inform customers about where we have sufficient inventory to fulfill their requirements. For the more unique and smaller segments of our portfolio, where lead times are longer and we need more visibility, I believe we stand out in that regard. Customers recognize and appreciate this. I hope we can maintain this level of support in the upcoming cycle and continue to grow our market share, as this is what customers anticipate, and I believe TI can excel in that area. Okay. So let me wrap it up and with what we've said previously, at our core, we are engineers and technology is the foundation of our company, but ultimately, our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate value for owners is the long-term growth of free cash flow per share. While we strive to achieve our objectives, we will continue to pursue our three ambitions. We will act like owners, we will own the company for decades. We will adapt and succeed in a world that's ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be proud of and would want as our neighbor.

This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the notice regarding forward-looking statements contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings, for a more complete description. I would like to provide some information that's important for your calendars. On Tuesday, February 4, at 10 a.m. Central Time, we will have our Capital Management call. Similar to what we've done in the past, Haviv, Rafael, and I will share our approach to capital allocation and summarize our progress as we prepare for the opportunity ahead. Moving on, today, we'll provide the following updates. First, Haviv will start with a quick overview of the quarter. Next, he will provide insight into fourth quarter revenue results, with some details of what we are seeing with respect to our end markets. Haviv will then provide the annual summary of revenue breakout by end market. And lastly, Rafael will cover the financial results and our guidance for the first quarter of 2025.

          "content": "Thanks, Dave. Let me start with a quick overview of the fourth quarter. Revenue was $4 billion, a decrease of 3% sequentially and 2% from the same quarter a year ago. Analog revenue grew 2% year-over-year after eight quarters of decline. Embedded processing declined 18%, and our Other segment grew from the year-ago quarter. Now, I'll provide some insight into our fourth quarter revenue by end market. Our overall results reflect the performance from our two largest markets, industrial and automotive, which saw modest sequential declines. Similar to last quarter, I'll focus on sequential performance as it is more informative at this time. First, the industrial market was down low-single-digits. The automotive market was down mid-single-digits. Personal electronics grew mid-single-digits. Next, enterprise systems declined low-single-digits. And lastly, communications equipment grew upper-single-digits. In addition, as we do at the end of each calendar year, I'll describe our revenue by end market. As a percentage of revenue for 2024, industrial was 34%; automotive, 35%; personal electronics, 20%; enterprise systems, 5%; communications equipment, 4%; and other was 2%. In 2024, industrial and automotive combined made up about 70% of TI's revenue, up from 42% in 2013. We see good opportunities in all of our markets, but we place additional strategic emphasis on industrial and automotive. Our customers across all regions are increasingly turning to analog and embedded technology to make their end products more reliable, more affordable, and lower in power. This drives growing chip content per application, or secular content growth, which will likely continue to drive faster growth in industrial and automotive. Rafael will now review profitability, capital management, and our outlook.",

          "content": "Thanks, Haviv, and good afternoon, everyone. As Haviv mentioned, fourth quarter revenue was $4 billion. Gross profit in the quarter was $2.3 billion, or 58% of revenue. Sequentially, gross profit decreased primarily due to lower revenue, higher depreciation, and reduced factory loadings. Gross profit margin decreased 190 basis points. Operating expenses in the quarter were $937 million, up 4% from a year ago and about as expected. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating expenses were $3.8 billion, or 24% of revenue. Operating profit was $1.4 billion in the quarter, or 34% of revenue, and profit was down 10% from the year-ago quarter. Net income in the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion, or $1.30 per share. Earnings per share included a $0.02 benefit for items that were not in our original guidance. Let me now comment on our capital management results, starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was $2 billion in the quarter. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in the quarter. In the quarter, we paid $1.2 billion in dividends and repurchased $537 million of our stock. We also increased our dividend per share by 5% in the fourth quarter, marking our 21st consecutive year of dividend increases. In total, we have returned $5.7 billion in the past 12 months to owners. Our balance sheet remains strong with $7.6 billion of cash and short-term investments at the end of the fourth quarter. Total debt outstanding was $13.7 billion, with a weighted average coupon of 3.79%. Inventory at the end of the quarter was $4.5 billion, up $231 million from the prior quarter, and days were 241, up 10 days sequentially. Now, let's look at some of these results for the year. In 2024, cash flow from operations was $6.3 billion, and capital expenditures were $4.8 billion, as expected. We are nearly 70% through a six-year elevated capex cycle that, once complete, will uniquely position TI to deliver dependable, low-cost 300-millimeter capacity at scale to meet customer demand. Free cash flow for 2024 was $1.5 billion, or 10% of revenue. Our free cash flow reflects the strength of our business model as well as our decisions to invest in 300-millimeter manufacturing assets and inventory to support our overall objective to maximize long-term free cash flow per share, which we believe is the primary driver of long-term value. Turning to our outlook for the first quarter, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.74 billion to $4.06 billion, and earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $1.16. Based on current tax law, we now expect our effective tax rate for 2025 to be about 12%. In closing, we will stay focused in the areas that add value in the long-term. We continue to invest in our competitive advantages, which are manufacturing and technology, a broad product portfolio, reach of our channels, and diverse and long-lived positions. We will continue to strengthen these advantages through disciplined capital allocation and by focusing on the best opportunities, which we believe will enable us to continue to deliver free cash flow per share growth over the long-term.

In Q1, the personal electronics market usually faces a significant seasonal drop, and since Q4 for PE was quite strong, this aligns with our expectations. In markets such as automotive and industrial, the declines are generally less severe. Regarding Q4, our main markets, industrial and automotive, behaved similarly to the overall company performance. For the industrial market, most sectors seem to have found their bottom, though some, particularly industrial automation and energy infrastructure, are still experiencing larger declines. We'll need to see how the first half of 2025 unfolds for those sectors. In the automotive market, we observed significant weakness similar to Q3, apart from China, which grew but not enough to counterbalance declines in Europe, the US, and Japan. Overall, the decline outside of China was more notable, with a mid-single-digit drop of about 5% sequentially. This is my high-level summary for Q4 and a bit for Q1.",

Is it primarily gross margin and behind that is it continued under loadings, increase in depreciation, some of the same dynamics we saw over the past 12 months, or is it higher OpEx, anything below the line?

So, on gross margins, keep in mind that depreciation is increasing, first of all. Second\u2014well, revenue is decreasing; that has an impact. Then, depreciation is increasing. And then, we are\u2014in order to manage inventory, we are reducing factory loadings. We've reduced some of that in the fourth quarter, but we're going to reduce those further in the first quarter. So, I do expect GPM percent to decrease probably a few hundred basis points fourth quarter to first quarter. Then, let me comment on OpEx. OpEx will increase 3% to 5% fourth to first, and that's kind of normal seasonal increases that happened in the first quarter on OpEx in addition to the overall increases in investments that we're making. Beyond that, this time, it's relevant that interest income is decreasing by about $50 million. The reason that is happening is short-term interest rates are decreasing, and that's where we invest our cash. And our cash on the balance sheet, cash levels are also decreasing. So, a combination of lower interest rates and lower cash gives you a significant drop in other income. So that's\u2014in this case, about $50 million less fourth going to first.",

As you remember, Embedded \u2014 our Embedded business grew in 2023, while our Analog business in '23 declined double digits. So, we saw a later peak on Embedded. That's the reason we see a sharper decline in Embedded right now while Analog in Q4 actually grew. So, I think Analog is about a year maybe ahead of Embedded in terms of the cyclical behavior.

I think the automotive, in fact, we talked about it last quarter; we're seeing the same phenomena, meaning customers are continuing to do well. And there is a bigger share for the EV vehicle type in China, which has higher content. So, secular growth is helping us in China on the automotive side. But you also see, and I think we mentioned it also in the previous calls that we had some supply limitations during the up cycle in China, and the personal electronics market was one of the main markets that suffered when we were short. We are seeing this market growing in China. It grew sequentially again nicely in Q3, but also year-over-year, that market grew significantly in China and also in the US. These are the main markets that we have our personal electronics businesses. So, overall \u2014 again, overall, business in China right now is healthy. You asked about industrial.

Of course, I think I did provide some color on revenue by market; that mix has changed, right?

It was not only supply/demand mismatch, but behavior of customers and almost anxiety of needing parts. So, I think inventory was built, and I think it's still playing out. I wouldn't say that this asynchronous behavior across markets is done. We see it still across sectors in industrial, we see it differently between geographies, we even see it internally between our Embedded business and Analog business. So, it's one of these things that, and I kind of hate to say it, but time will tell where we are. I am excited about the fact that now we have the right inventory level, the right supply to support growth. I'm encouraged about our progress in the analog market. As I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we did grow the Analog business from a year-over-year perspective in Q4. It was a couple of points of growth, but after about eight quarters of decline, and I think we \u2014 I look forward to continue to grow that business, especially when you think about the longer-term. And most importantly, the secular growth in the market that we've mentioned, industrial and automotive, I'm convinced that it's there. I'm convinced that our product portfolio is improving and strengthening, and we will have the right level of capacity and inventory to support our customers.

I will say that I think that some of the markets and we've seen it through 2024, they are already on the cyclical upturn. We saw it in PE, then enterprise, really driven by data center joint and we are seeing nice growth over there. And even communication business, I would say that I think it found the bottom. We saw it somewhere in, I think, in Q1 of '24 and grew sequentially since then and even returned to year-over-year growth in Q4. So, these three markets, I think they are on the upturn. And I don't think that I expect at least that if nothing major changes to continue into 2025. The big question for us is also 75% of our business or 70% of our business in 2024 is industrial and automotive. And here, we haven't seen the bottom yet. Let's be very clear about that. We're seeing points of strength. I've given China as an example, but we'll have to see how the year plays out. I do believe that this on the industrial side that there is kind of \u2014 as I said last time, kind of this hovering at a low level.

We are going through a transition, especially on the manufacturing side, and that puts pressure on the margins.

And then, the other reason is LFAB, right? So, Embedded is taking a disproportionate amount of the impact from having LFAB underutilized. But let me stress, just like that takes away, it gives it to you on the other end. So, when we ramp \u2014 as we ramp LFAB and as we move from external to internal, you're really going to like the fall-through both to GPM, but even better to free cash flow as we do that.

And then, after you do that, then you have to adjust for depreciation increases. And I already gave you the depreciation numbers, so you can model that in the future. This works much better if you do full years and you do it over the long term rather than any given quarter. And on that, the other factor that you have is the factory loadings or underutilization. Right now, as I mentioned, we expect a hit from that in the first quarter, but just as it's a hit sometimes, it's a benefit when you go the other way. And \u2014 but that depends on revenue expectations. So, if revenue materializes in the future, and we expect that to continue, then we ramp up the factories and that helps with the loadings and that tends to take the 75% to 85% towards the high end of that range.

You mentioned not necessarily wanting to drain the inventory levels below the $4.5 billion levels. As we think about how you're thinking about Q1, though, like is this the level you're comfortable with and you're going to manage to the $4.5 billion? And, I guess, to ask more acutely, is there a near- to medium-term inventory target on a days basis that we should be thinking about? Because I know that's obviously evolved through the last several years. I'd be curious how you're thinking about it now as we sort of are chipping closer to end demand.",

But big picture, inventory, the goal here, the objective is to maintain high levels of customer service while we minimize the obsolescence of inventory. We have target levels at the finished goods, at the chip level for the 80,000 parts that we sell in different end markets, and that is done in a very rigorous and disciplined way on a part by part basis. So that's how we look at it. And the risk of obsolescence on this part is very, very low. This part lasts for a long time. They sell to many, many customers for many, many years in very long life cycles. Now, to the specific that you have, given how we're running the factories right now, I would expect a further increase of inventory levels going into the first quarter, but probably in the $100 million, $100 million-plus level, and then potentially stabilize at that point around that level.",

I guess, I wanted to ask bigger picture, not necessarily pricing related, but as some of your peers have sort of gotten through and lapped and are no longer shipping to NCRS or LTSAs, have you noticed a change in the competitive backdrop on the number of sockets that are open for competition?

Just at the Capital Management Day, you guys highlighted different CapEx ranges depending on kind of different revenue CAGRs. And I know the intention there wasn't to guide revenue, but you just updated us on depreciation in response to just the ITC and some of the grants as well. Is the depreciation being at the lower end entirely a function or the updated guide that you're giving today entirely a function of those tax credits and grants, or is that a function of potentially lower CapEx as well?",

We always look at the environment and what's going on, but based on what I see right now, you shouldn't expect the plan to change in terms of our Phase 1 and Phase 2, as I described. Phase 1 is serving us very well. This is how we move revenue from external foundries into our LFAB factory in Utah. And also, on the analog side, we want most of our parts running on 300 rather than, for example, 6-inch fabs that we are shutting down, and that's going well. The Phase 2 is very important for our future. So, we are going to complete the qualification line in Sherman 1, we are going to set the shell or build the shell in Sherman 2, and also build the shell in Lehi, so it can give us this flexible capacity phase that we are so excited about and so are the customers. Once they engage with us, they fully understand that not only they will have enough cleanroom capacity to grow into, but also the qualification is going to be behind them. So, the parts are already running, for example, in Sherman or in Lehi, and that gives them a very, very easy path to grow their business with us without having to go through a recall and new fabs or new suppliers. So, I think that then serves our customers well, and we will continue to execute to it. And as you said, the slides in August and I will probably see a very similar story in a couple of weeks is that we want to say that we have a plan, but we do always have flexibility into the plan, especially in 2026 and 2027.",

So, an article is out on a China statement talking about dumping product in that market. I think there's an ongoing debate just around the sustainability of China longer-term. I guess part of this question is, can you just address what you've seen in the public there? And then, kind of as a derivative of that, you're obviously growing year-over-year in China. You're seeing strength in China auto. You highlighted that. But outside of that, are you seeing any change in the dynamic there in terms of your ability to ship product competition, just addressing the whole debate? Thank you.",

China represents 20% more or less of world GDP, and you want to play in that market. By the way, our business in 2024 in China was at about 20%. So, we are kind of not over or under penetrated in China; it's kind of just right at 20%. And our commitment is to our customers. Our customers in China, they rely on our parts, they want to have the best products, they want to have the highest quality, they want to get the best service, and TI is a good supplier. And on top of it, their ambition is to be global players, right? So, maybe, they are part of the headquarters in China, but they want to sell their end equipment to any geography. And in that sense, TI is a great supplier because we are a global player. We have a diverse footprint of manufacturing and support structure, and that's a great fit for their needs. Now, as you know, and I think this is not news, the China end market has always been competitive and is continuing to be. We know that they are very capable, motivated, fast-moving competition, but I think the competitive advantages of TI allows us to compete whether it's our broad portfolio, the reach of the channel, and also our position in industrial and automotive customers value that and want to continue to do business with TI, and we want to compete and that's really the fact that we own our manufacturing, own our technology. I think we have the right cost structure to compete across our entire portfolio, whether it's low AUP general-purpose parts or very integrated sophisticated ASSPs that are tailored for a specific application. We don't need to sub-select. We want to compete across our portfolio, and our customers there appreciate that, and I continue to see that. Specifically to your question, at this time, we haven't been notified about an investigation, and it's kind of business as usual between us and our customers in China.",

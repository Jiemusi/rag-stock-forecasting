          "content": "Right. Thank you, Ji. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So in our fiscal Q1 2022, consolidated net revenue was a record $7.7 billion, up 16% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue grew 20% year-on-year to $5.9 billion and infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. Now enterprise demand grew very robustly from the trough we saw in Q1 last year as the recovery in enterprise IT spending continued to accelerate. Meanwhile, hyper clouds are upgrading their data centers, and service providers and telcos continue to deploy next-generation fiber-to-the-home. As expected, against the peak of a year ago, wireless grew single digits, and our core software business remains very stable and steady. On the supply front, lead times remain extended and unchanged as inventory of our products in the channel and in our customers remains lean. Our semiconductor backlog at the close of Q1 continued to grow double digits from that of the prior quarter. Let me now provide more color by end markets, starting with networking. Networking revenue of $1.9 billion was up 33% year-on-year and represented 32% of our semiconductor revenue. This strong growth was driven by deployment at scale of Tomahawk 4 and compute offload across several hyperscale customers as they upgrade and scale out their data centers. In enterprises, campus switching upgrades continue to accelerate. Let me talk about routing in this space. Investments in 5G backhaul by telco operators worldwide continue to drive strong growth in our Qumran family of products. More than this, the opportunity in our routing silicon has expanded into hyperscale in a very significant way, moving Ethernet into the back-end network of large-scale AI/ML clusters. In particular, I\u2019m referring to the Arista\u2019s 7800 AI platform, which scales Ethernet to connect many tens of thousands of CPUs and GPUs in hyperscale. Our devices provide the most cost-effective fabric for AI/ML scale with a congestion managed lossless network and highest efficiency load balancing across the links. Now in contrast to proprietary protocols such as InfiniBand used typically in high-performance computing, we see low-latency Ethernet as the way forward for large-scale AI/ML networks as a widely adopted open architecture. Our unique ability to network these complex AI workloads in hyperscale is extending our customized training and inference SoC footprint at several cloud giants. In Q2, we expect networking to continue to be strong across the board and revenue growth to be in excess of 30% year-over-year. Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $801 million, and growth accelerated to 32% year-on-year, representing 14% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven in large part by the continuing recovery of enterprise IT spending, much of which was deployed towards upgrading compute services. And most of these compute services use either our MegaRAID or SAN for server storage connectivity. We are also benefiting from increased content as enterprises upgrade to next-generation storage connectivity solutions to support deployment of leading-edge servers. Beyond enterprise, with the proliferation of video content in social media, we see our cloud customers increasingly adopting Nearline hard disk drives as the primary storage of choice. And to manage this array of hard disk drives, they deploy storage services and expanders, which utilize our next-generation storage connectivity silicon and software, creating another driver for revenue growth. Interestingly, we are also a critical supplier of preamplifiers and re-channels in Nearline hard disk drives, with our revenue growing at over 20% CAGR over the last five years. Our Nearline revenue represented over two-thirds of our hard drive business this quarter. With the adoption of next-generation technology here, we\u2019re selling more than just silicon, resulting in much higher dollar content. This dynamic, coupled with continuing strong demand from both enterprise and hyperscale, is expected to accelerate Q2 server storage connectivity revenue to over 55% year-on-year. Now moving on to broadband. Revenue of $911 million grew 23% year-on-year and represented 16% of semiconductor revenue. This was driven largely by increased deployment of next-generation PON and DOCSIS, our cable modem, with high attach rates of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E in home gateways. Examples of this include last quarter, Charter announced trials of DOCSIS 4.0 running at speeds of 8.5 gigabit downstream and 6 gigabit upstream, both in CPE and remote node. Comcast started the deployment of their Wi-Fi 6E DOCSIS 3.1 gateway, and AT&T announced a multi-gig PON service on their gateways. All of these are using Broadcom SoCs. We remain the market leader in delivering Wi-Fi 6 and 6E chips to leading phones as well as routers, enterprise access points, and carrier gateways. Through the first quarter of 2022, we have cumulatively shipped over 1 billion Wi-Fi 6 and 6E radios in just around three years since our launch. Our OEM customers and carrier partners are now ramping Wi-Fi 6E, the current generation of Wi-Fi making use of the 6 gigahertz band, which has increasingly been made available for unlicensed access across the globe. And as we look ahead, we are the industry leader, heavily investing in Wi-Fi 7 as a strategic complement to 10G PON and cable modem. We see this as the next step in broadband development and deployment globally. In the U.S. alone, the pending infrastructure access of $65 billion over the next five years aims to connect more homes to high-speed broadband. Across the world, the same is happening as next-generation wide broadband is seen as the better alternative to 5G for home connectivity. As far as Q2 is concerned, we expect our broadband business to continue to grow 20% year-on-year. Moving on to wireless. Q1 revenue of $2 billion represented 34% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from our North American customers for our products continued to be strong during the quarter, driving wireless revenue up 10% sequentially and up 4% year-on-year from the peak quarter in fiscal 2021. As expected in Q2, wireless revenue will be seasonally down about mid-teens quarter-on-quarter, but will still be up mid-single digits from a year ago. Finally, industrial revenue of $243 million represented approximately 4% of Q1 semiconductor revenue. Q1 resales of $239 million grew 37% year-over-year driven by robust demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, factory automation, and healthcare. Reflecting such strong resales, our inventory in the channel remain around one month, and we expect resales to continue to be strong in Q2. Accordingly, in summary, Q1 semiconductor solution revenue was up 20% year-on-year. Q2, we expect semiconductor revenue to accelerate to 25% year-on-year. Turning to software. In Q1, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 24% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 6% year-on-year. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 121% over expiring contracts, while in our strategic accounts, we averaged 136%. Within these strategic accounts, $656 million represented renewals on expiring contracts, of which $164 million represented cross-selling, including PLAs, of our portfolio products to the same customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. Okay. ARR, annual recurring revenue, at the end of Q1 was $5.3 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. In Q2, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-on-year. In summary, in Q1, semiconductor revenue grew a strong 20%. In fact, excluding wireless, it grew over 30%. Combined with our stable software business, consolidated revenue grew 16% year-on-year to $7.7 billion. Now turning to Q2 guidance. We expect semiconductor revenue growth will accelerate to 25% year-on-year. And excluding wireless, it will be 35% year-on-year. Layering on our stable software business, we expect Q2 consolidated revenue growth of 20% year-on-year to $7.9 billion. And before I turn this call over to Kirsten, I just want to add that Broadcom recently published its second annual ESG report available on the company\u2019s corporate citizenship site, which discusses the company\u2019s ESG initiatives. As a global technology leader, we recognize the company\u2019s responsibility to have a positive impact on our communities through our product and technology innovation and operational excellence, and we remain very committed to this mission. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $7.7 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 227 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 6% year-on-year, driven by investment in research and development. Operating income for the quarter was $4.7 billion and was up 23% from a year ago. Operating margin was 60% of revenue, up approximately 362 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $4.8 billion or 62.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $136 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $5.9 billion and represented 76% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 20% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 347 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $817 million in Q1, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $725 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins increased to 57%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 20%, operating profit grew 31%. Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 24% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, up 71 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, up 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 71% in Q1, and operating profit grew 7%. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.4 billion, representing 44% of revenue. We spent $101 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the first quarter compared to 35 days a year ago. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.5 billion, up 17% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs. Our hardware backlog at the end of the quarter was over $25 billion compared to $22 billion the preceding quarter. And our lead times remain steady at 50 weeks. Our software backlog continued to grow as well and ended the quarter at over $15 billion. As a point of reference, software backlog was $13 billion a year ago. We ended the quarter with $10.2 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $300 million is short term. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.8 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.7 billion in common stock and eliminated $375 million of common stock for taxes due on the vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 5 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was $446 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $7.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 62.5% of projected revenue. Note that we expect Q2 non-GAAP diluted share count to be 442 million. This excludes the potential impact of any share repurchases completed in the second quarter. That concludes my prepared remarks.

Your end markets are strong, right? Cloud and hyperscale CapEx spending is looking to grow about 30%. You\u2019re driving the 200 and 400-gig networking upgrade cycle. Enterprise spending is still expanding. As you mentioned, Broadcom continues strong, whether it\u2019s DOCSIS, Wi-Fi, fiber upgrades. And then on your compute acceleration ASIC pipeline, you\u2019ve got Google, Facebook, Microsoft, all of these guys ramping. So it seems like the demand, your product leadership, seasonality can sustain a sort of low to mid-20% plus type year-over-year revenue growth profile through this year. So I guess the question for you is, do you have line of sight and confidence on sustaining this type of growth through the year?

And as the foundry capacity eases, that your costs will go down and the pricing advantage will disappear.

And I mean, true, the real demand that we\u2019re seeing underlying \u2013 if you talk about underlying trends that are sustainable, at least in this typical upcycle, you\u2019re right, it\u2019s \u2013 while we\u2019re showing 30% in networking and in server storage, a part of it is driven by ASP increases simply because we are passing on our material cost increases, wafer, substrates, assembly to our customers, inevitably. But it\u2019s much less than you probably think it is. What is really sustainable is what Harlan said in the previous question. We think the trend demand increase is more like closer to 20% year-on-year than what perhaps in dollar terms you\u2019re representing. And how long would it last? Who knows? It\u2019s hard for me to figure out because I\u2019ve been wrong so many times, and this is now going into the nearly \u2013 2022 is done and is strong. We\u2019re now booking, given our lead times, in 2023. And 2023, I think, will be \u2013 at least the first half of 2023 will still be pretty close to the same. And it\u2019s the latter part of 2023 and 2024 that we have to figure out whether there\u2019s enough supply that will start coming in to basically address what is today a very strong demand environment, whether it\u2019s from enterprise, telcos and service providers and hyperscale; all three are strong.",

And if I sort of squint at your guidance, it implies gross margins into Q2 at least at that level, if not even probably higher. And this is amid cost increases and everything else. So I mean how do we think about like the limited \u2013 I know you always talked about margins kind of going up 100 basis points a year, and they seem to be doing even better than that. Do we just keep modeling them going up from here? Or do you think they take a pause? Are there any other drivers like into the back of this year mix or anything else that would sit on that? Just how do we think about it just given the levels that they\u2019re sitting at right now?",

You get that. Now Kirsten just indicated, we did better than that in semiconductor. And I guess the \u2013 and the reason why we did better than that this season, so to speak, if you come back to my remarks, there\u2019s a lot of deployment \u2013 launch and deployment of new generation products that I mentioned. We\u2019re talking about in networking, Tomahawk 4, and much more, Trident 4, which is more towards some data centers that use in enterprises, come out for use in hyper cloud, that new generation. Then we talk about Jericho being deployed \u2013 the latest Jericho being deployed in the bank site networks of machine learning, AI, GPU in the connectivity. That\u2019s a whole new application. Then we talk - in service storage, I\u2019ve talked about a whole slew of new generation solutions, which we put in place towards, basically, for new generation, leading-edge servers out there from the guys who do those servers. And with those new generation, we get that better margin. So in all, I guess the additional input I put in is a lot more new generation products coming out now, and are seeing this happen. And of course, we are, in this environment, thankfully, able to pass on our cost increases to supply \u2013 to customers. And that all adds up to a fairly decent gross margin set of results. But do not let that be an indicator, please, that it is something that will be a 200, 300 basis points expansion year-on-year.

          "content": "Yes, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Hock, usually at this point in the cycle with lead times extended as much as they are and you guys getting pricing power, the big concern on Wall Street is to what extent is the demand you\u2019re seeing real demand versus perhaps your customers building inventory. And I know you\u2019re less consumer-focused than most. And so maybe inventory builds are less relevant in some of these infrastructure markets. But I\u2019m wondering if you could give us your perspective on \u2013 or at least what you guys try to do to scrub the backlog to make sure it\u2019s good demand. And if you think it\u2019s good demand, I\u2019m kind of curious, you\u2019ve always had a very realistic view of what the long-term growth rate for your semi business should be \u2013 semi business should be. Is that beginning to change? And like many of your peers who have put up a higher kind of new CAGR, are you willing to go there right now?",

          "content": "Let\u2019s answer the first question first, and let me go to the last one and the best at the end. But on the first part, yes, as I\u2019ve stated in previous earnings calls, I\u2019m more than happy to reiterate it here, which is we are very, very concerned, obviously, that you could \u2013 we could easily build up inventory in various parts of our demand environment, just because we ship according to what customers send in orders as their customer requested. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we actually spend a huge amount of bandwidth of our operations and salespeople in this environment to make sure we get products to any particular customer just when they need it. Not any earlier and hopefully not too late either because we like to address customer\u2019s real need in that regard. But what\u2019s very, very important to us is not to ship excessively. And inventory, whether it\u2019s in the customer inventory, in distribution, the nice thing about our business in semiconductor is this, 75% of our revenue comes from just about 100 customers, and they\u2019re direct. The last 25% goes through distribution. 75% direct to 100 customers. We have enough salespeople. We have enough visibility on these customers to know exactly pretty closely, we\u2019d like to think, what they need and ship to what exactly they need. And when we do all that, I said it before in last earnings call, true in demand growth \u2013 true growth as we have been seeing in 2021, it was about 20% year-on-year improvement. Now we now take on the fact that material costs have gone up in 2022. So there\u2019s an addition beyond 20%. I still believe it\u2019s about 20% in response to earlier in this environment because the last up cycle we saw in 2017, it was 20% year-on-year improvement. It wasn\u2019t stronger than that. And by the way, we sell mostly those big core systems on a chip into any platform that our customer builds and sells. We do \u2013 and generally, we get very good visibility. If we were to sell more of the peripheral chips, the secondary chips, that adds up to the total platform, and that causes a fraction of what our system on a chip costs, then perhaps you will not have that visibility, and we believe there are a lot of pockets of those inventory in the wrong places because of unbalanced chipsets sitting out there. But if you \u2013 for example, if you\u2019re building a data center and you need 1,000 Tomahawk 4s, believe me, you will not buy more than 1,050 Tomahawk 4s. But if you\u2019re buying voltage regulator, you probably buy 2,000, 3,000 of those voltage regulators just in case. And that\u2019s the difference in what we\u2019re seeing. So we think we get a good sense of what\u2019s out there. And the kicker here is the price increase that was passed on because of wafer cost and substrate cost increases, which makes it go over perhaps what we think is a sustainable level. Now to answer your longer-term question, no, I don\u2019t think on a long-term, say, next 10 years, would the CAGR change, I think people will say that CAGR change, frankly, are probably dreaming because there\u2019s no evidence on our side to show why this industry, which is relatively mature semiconductor industry, should suddenly spiral into a different trend growth rate. We have seen in the last 10 years, compounded roughly 5% annual growth rate. And there\u2019s nothing to indicate, frankly, why you would not be that way for the next long-term, 10 years. Now it won\u2019t be 5% every year, obviously. We\u2019re not at 5% this year. But on the long-term, I still think that trend has not changed.",

In the meantime, given two years, 2020 and 2022, when we haven\u2019t done anything on acquisitions and have been earning and generating lots of cash, we have taken on \u2013 other than paying dividends and maintaining the policy on dividends that we have outlined for the long-term, we have decided for fiscal 2022 \u2013 for actually calendar 2022 to put out that buyback program of $10 billion. We spent $2.7 billion of it so far, and we have probably most of the year to go. And we\u2019ll likely use all of it up evenly over the next nine months of the remaining year.

All those have customized silicon accelerators to enable these hyper cloud guys to run their workloads better and more effectively. I believe that was your question. And the best way to answer your question is year-on-year this quarter, Q1, we grew revenue in this offload computing sector, which all ASIC north of 50% revenue year-on-year. All right?

And we are not only selling one product but selling multiple products, which are very strategic to us and I believe also very important and strategic to them, which will \u2013 which is what makes a partnership very sustaining. I see this as a very long-term sustaining partnership in the sense of the products we do develop we collectively call wireless because it goes into mobile \u2013 a lot of mobile devices, though not entirely, but most of it goes into phones. It goes into wearables, it goes into pads or tablets. And it goes into not so mobile, but many of them are into even notebooks. It goes into all the stuff, and we sell \u2013 we develop and provide something like about five different critical engine technology products to this same customer.

Thanks for your answer, Hock, but I want to step back and maybe look at the longer-term on this. You \u2013 when you bought Brocade, it kind of shifted the narrative from we don\u2019t really need revenue growth. We\u2019re mostly looking for cash flow and high margins, which worked out very well. In wireless, you get a little bit different animal with Samsung on the way out because they shifted their phone strategy to more cost-centric and less performance-wise. It made sense for Broadcom to participate there. And your large customer is doing fine. It looks like they will be for years. But as we\u2019ve already seen on the high end, 5G, the growth in revenue \u2013 growth in content is slowing. And by all measures, it will likely stagnate in the next three years to four years. In that kind of environment, and especially if you\u2019re not doing the custom designs anymore, given \u2013 it\u2019s just given the revenue may not grow, if margins are affected, what do you do with it? I mean you\u2019ve not ever embraced the business where both revenues are flat to down and margins are in decline. I think the question a lot of folks have is, what could you possibly do? It\u2019s so large, and there are so few suitors for it. It\u2019s kind of puzzling in three years or four years what the strategy will be with wireless. Maybe you could help shed a light on that.

Here, all our businesses \u2013 I just want to remind you, in our view, as I said, in the view of all semiconductor segments itself, it\u2019s not a high-growth business. You guys like to think because probably there are a few companies out there who are trying to grow in a business that doesn\u2019t grow. 5% is what it is. And so it\u2019s a business that does grow, but in dollar terms overall, mid-single digits. I call it a slow growth industry. Within it, however, it still evolves new generations of products constantly. That\u2019s the unusual unique thing about semiconductors. It keeps evolving. Not disruptive much as people like to say they are disruptive. My view is that it is evolutionary, but that evolution creates new opportunities for basically selling a better product, a more valuable product to the same customer for the similar application, which then the customer can monetize back on their own. And that\u2019s really all it is. And what we are doing here in wireless is no different. And there is something also very interesting. Every product we sell in wireless is, in fact, a non-standard product. It is customized. It is customized for the needs \u2013 for the unique needs and particular requirements of that particular customer. That\u2019s what makes us so successful, and that\u2019s what makes the partnership so sustainable. We developed technology in the form of products that we do, whether it\u2019s RF, with FBAR, front-end modules or whether it\u2019s pure silicon with some SDK software where a lot of SDK software where some unique high-performance mixed signal, analog product, all of which we do for this customer, we do it to meet their particular requirements, which allow their products to be at a level that\u2019s very differentiated from their own space \u2013 in the competitive space they are in. And that\u2019s what makes it very unique, and that\u2019s what makes this thing keep going. But we\u2019re not looking for in any end market we are in, in any product line we are in, for high growth. High growth in semiconductor comes in spurts and do not last.

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you everyone for joining today. If you could indulge me, let me start off by reviewing our fiscal Q2 results and our outlook for Q3, and the broader markets, of course, we play in. So in fiscal Q2 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.1 billion, up 23% year-on-year. Semiconductor Solutions revenue growth accelerated to 29% year-on-year to $6.2 billion and infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to $1.9 billion. Demand, as referenced by consolidated bookings, continues to be strong, even as our lead times remain unchanged, but extended. In Hardware, backlog at the end of Q2 was over $29 billion compared to $25 billion in the preceding quarter, and $21 billion a year ago. In software, backlog grew as well and ended the quarter at over $15 billion compared to $14 billion a year ago. Let me provide more color by end markets. Starting with networking. Networking revenue was a record $2.2 billion with growth accelerating to 44% year-on-year. There were 2 major drivers. We saw substantial deployment by hyperscalers of their AI engines and networks using our silicon during this quarter. More importantly, we saw the adoption of our next-generation merchant switching and routing, continuing to accelerate in hyperscale, enterprises, and service providers at the expense of proprietary solutions. This fundamental transition to merchant silicon based on Broadcom's platform will continue in Q3. And as a result, we expect in excess of 25% year-over-year growth in networking. Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $939 million, and as we guided, accelerated to 66% year-on-year growth. While service storage spending in the enterprise was strong, our content increase in next-generation mega rates drove a substantial portion of this growth. Additionally, hyperscalers are aggressively adopting our next-generation server storage solutions to scale their massive consumption of nearline hard disk drive arrays. So in Q3, we expect these same drivers to continue with revenue to grow over 60% year-on-year. Now moving on to broadband. Q2 revenue of $1.1 billion grew 24% year-on-year. Deployment during the quarter of next-generation PON and cable modem with high fetch rate of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E continue to be good among major service providers globally. Just as a reminder, however, expansion in broadband investments arising particularly from COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns is a multiyear phenomenon. Investments are measured, and we are still in the early innings. Accordingly, in Q3, we do expect Broadcom's broadband revenue to sustain a growth rate around 20% year-on-year. On wireless, Q2 revenue of $1.7 billion was up 6% from a year ago, and as guided declined the seasonal 14% quarter-on-quarter. In Q3, we expect wireless revenue to be flat to slightly down quarter-on-quarter, but our mid-teens percentage from a year ago, reflecting an increase in content. Finally, in Industrial, Q2 resales of $254 million grew 14% year-over-year, driven by strong demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, factory automation, and health care. Reflecting such strong resales, our inventory in the channel continued to be very lean at around 1 month. And in Q3, we expect industrial resales to remain stable and inventory levels to continue to be lean. So in summary, Q2 Semiconductor Solutions revenue was up 29% year-on-year, a step-up from the 20% year-on-year growth in the preceding quarter. As I highlighted above, content increase in server storage and a fundamental shift to merchant silicon in switching and routing drove this accelerated growth. This will continue in Q3 and accordingly, we expect semiconductor revenue in Q3 to grow 31% year-on-year. Now turning to software. In Q2, infrastructure software revenue of $1.9 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 23% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 5% year-on-year. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 120% over expiring contracts. While in strategic accounts, we averaged 136%. Within our strategic accounts, $641 million represented renewals and expiring contracts, of which $117 million represented cross-selling, including PLAs of our portfolio products to these same customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. ARR at the end of Q2 was $5.4 billion, which was up 4% from a year ago. And in Q3, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain at mid-single-digit percent growth year-over-year. In summary, our outlook for Q3, Semiconductor revenue growth will continue to be strong, up 31% year-on-year. Layering on our stable software business, we expect Q3 consolidated revenue growth of 24% year-on-year to $8.4 billion. Well, that concludes my discussion of our second-quarter results. I will now turn to what perhaps you all have been waiting to hear more about. Now please refer to our accompanying slides regarding our agreement to acquire VMware. As you know, we never embarked on an acquisition unless we feel our core is very strong and solid. Irrespective of what you might think of where we are in the semiconductor cycle today, I do want to reassure you the fundamentals of our business, both in semiconductors and in software have never been stronger. We have just reviewed how solidly grounded these businesses are. So let me discuss now what we believe is a very unique opportunity to take our company and its business to the next level. Starting with Slide #4. By adding VMware, we will bring significant scale to Broadcom's software business and reinforce our position as a premier provider of mission-critical platform solutions to enterprises globally. VMware is an iconic company providing core cloud infrastructure that powers modern enterprises. The company began as the virtualization pioneer, bringing revolutionary levels of efficiency to on-premise data centers. VMware extended its platform to the private cloud, giving enterprise customers unmatched levels of security, performance, and control over their applications and underlying infrastructure. The most exciting today, VMware is now powering solutions for multi-cloud, hybrid cloud future where it will be possible for enterprises to develop and run their apps anywhere, everywhere with known trade-offs in a truly cloud-neutral fashion. One of the reasons we became very interested in VMware was because of its world-class team, engineering-centric culture, and strong customer and partner relationships.",

          "content": "Thanks, Hock. Now turning to Slide 7. As Hock previewed, VMware sits at the nexus of the largest opportunity in enterprise infrastructure today. In essence, VMware is a foundational platform that enables enterprises to drive competitive advantage with technology by leveraging 2 operational modes to develop and run their applications. First, VMware serves many of the same types of customers that we have worked with at Broadcom, large multinational organizations with complex IT challenges. These enterprises want to move fast and innovate, but also mitigate risk by retaining control of their underlying infrastructure and data. To do this, enterprises are deploying applications in their data centers, but need software to enable them to develop and run these applications in a flexible, agile, and cost-effective fashion. This private cloud market is very large and workload growth in the private cloud continues to grow. Beyond the private cloud, as we all know, public cloud workloads are growing rapidly. The public cloud brings unprecedented scalability and cost benefits and also enables enterprises to leverage cutting-edge technologies to drive their business forward. So we think it is clear that both of these modes, private cloud and public cloud are going to be important for enterprises going forward. Turning to Slide 8, VMware is a truly foundational infrastructure software platform that is critical for enterprises to leverage the benefits of both the private and public cloud. We have tremendous respect for the leading platform VMware has built, supported by an incredible team of R&D talent. By bringing our teams together, we will deliver even more innovation to our customers. As we think about it, VMware's platform really consists of 3 pillars: First, within the core private cloud infrastructure pillar is the category defining vSphere server virtualization platform, vSAN data storage virtualization solution, vRealize cloud management platform that provides automation, analytics, and lifecycle management for private cloud workloads, and NSX, which enables enterprises to manage their entire physical network as a single entity from a single pane of glass. Next, VMware's Tanzu platform provides an end-to-end modern application management platform for building, deploying, securing, and operating applications in private, hybrid, or public cloud environments. Finally, VMware has a robust portfolio of end-user and security solutions that enable employees to securely work from anywhere, anytime and with seamless employee experiences. On Slide 9, let me double-click on the first pillar, as this makes the bulk of VMware's revenue contribution today and is positioned to continue to grow well going forward. VMware pioneered the concept of virtualization, and today this technology is foundational to the development and computing operations of basically all enterprises in the world. Over time, VMware has evolved its value proposition from core server virtualization to enabling one to virtualize the underlying compute resources of the entire data center, which is the private cloud. They further extended this value proposition with NSX and vSAN by enabling software-defined networks and storage. Then with vRealize, VMware made it extremely easy to manage and operate the entire data center infrastructure. With these products, VMware offers a complete platform that delivers the scalability, flexibility, and cost benefits of virtualizing the underlying infrastructure across servers, networking, and storage. In concert with this private cloud capability, VMware also offers a seamless way to evolve the enterprise infrastructure to embrace the benefits of the public cloud with VMware Cloud Foundation. VMware Cloud Foundation gives the same operating environment for developers, letting them write the code once and deploy it anywhere they want, whether it's in the private cloud, in AWS, Azure, GCP, or even across clouds. This simplicity is unique to VMware in ushering in the coming age of mass cloud adoption. Stepping back on Slide 10 and thinking about our existing software portfolio, we are incredibly excited about the opportunity to marry our products with the VMware platform to deliver more end-to-end capabilities to our enterprise customers. As we all know, enterprises need to manage a constantly changing portfolio of thousands of applications that reside on a wide variety of underlying infrastructures; from mainframe to client server, to hybrid and public cloud. And all of these applications are operating in different stages of their life cycle. And we think together, Broadcom software assets for the distributed enterprise can seamlessly complement and augment VMware's multi-cloud offerings in the areas of operation management, value stream and DevOps management, and security to address the entire application life cycle.",

          "content": "Thank you, Tom. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $8.1 billion for the quarter, up 23% from a year ago. Gross margin was 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 145 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year, driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $4.9 billion and was up 30% from a year ago. Operating margin was 61% of revenue, up approximately 345 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.1 billion or 63.1% of revenue. This figure excludes $135 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our 2 segments. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $6.2 billion and represented 77% of total revenue. This was up 29% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 72%, up 290 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $873 million in Q2, up 10% year-on-year. R&D was $772 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q2 semiconductor operating margins increased to 58%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 29%, operating profit grew 42%. Moving to the P&L for our Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.9 billion and represented 23% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 90% in the quarter, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses were $374 million in the quarter, up 5% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software operating margin was 70% in Q2 and operating profit grew 5%. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.2 billion, representing 51% of revenue; we spent $85 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 35 days in the second quarter, and we ended the second quarter with inventory of $1.7 billion. We also ended the second quarter with $9 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $302 million is short-term. With liability management activities during the quarter, we were able to extend our weighted average debt maturity from 10.4 to 10.9 years, with the weighted average interest rate relatively unchanged at 3.6%. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.8 billion in cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.8 billion in common stock and eliminated $514 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 6 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q2 was 441 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $8.4 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63.5% of projected revenue. Note, that we expect Q3 non-GAAP diluted share count to be 439 million. With the acquisition of VMware, let me now share our thinking on capital allocation policy going forward. Historically, over the last 6 years, we have grown free cash flow to increase at a 41% CAGR organically and through acquisitions. With the acquisition of VMware, we expect to enhance our already strong organic earnings and free cash flow growth. The Board of Directors has approved a third-quarter cash dividend on our common stock of $4.10 per share. Following the acquisition of VMware, we remain committed to our dividend policy of returning 50% of prior year's free cash flows as dividends. We are also committed to maintaining our investment-grade rating and plan to rapidly delever from approximately 3.5x gross debt-to-EBITDA at closing to normalized leverage ratio of less than 2.5x gross debt to EBITDA within approximately 2 years post deal close. Between now and deal close, we expect to generate considerable free cash flow. As it relates to the buyback, we have $3 billion remaining under the current authorization to date. In addition, we are announcing today an incremental $10 billion authorization to buy back shares through the end of December of 2023. That concludes my prepared remarks.",

You gave a bit of a long-term model, mid-single-digit revenue growth and then mid-single or mid-60s EBITDA. Can you talk a little bit about the revenue growth side of that equation? It seems like the VMware asset according to the Street is growing a little bit faster than that. What are you doing and assuming as far as the growth rate of that piece? And then on the EBITDA side of things, out of the levers you showed on, I think it's Slide 13. Can you just give us an idea of how those all fall in to get you to that mid-60s level overall?",

          "content": "Sure, Ross, thanks for the question. Let me start and then I'll let Hock embellish. When we think about the top line, a number of things are going on. But fundamentally, and this is actually back on Slide 7 if everyone has the deck, it's all about workload growth. I mean if you think about private cloud growing mid- to high single digits, public cloud growing high double digits. That's what's really going to drive the top line fundamentally, and that's actually what it got us comfortable with the key business case here. I think in addition to that, we are going to focus on going through a transition and a rapid transition from perpetual licensing to subscription. As you know, with the software business, we've been totally focused on pretty much 100% recurring revenue. And we see ARR growth being able to sustain at 5%, if not faster, when we think about the combined business. When we think about EBITDA, there are multiple knobs. We covered that. You can look at Slide 13. In terms of R&D, we're going to reinvest back in the core business, the core franchises. If you think about the 3 different pillars of this business, and I went through it. But it's really the core infrastructure business, vSAN, vSphere, vRealize. These are the businesses that are core to driving the bulk of the revenues, and that's where the reinvestment is going to occur. We are going to focus on our common customers. We have a significant go-to-market engine here at Broadcom software, obviously, so does VMware in their own regard, actually much more significant than ours. And so we have a direct sales force, and we're going to leverage the fact that we have common coverage in both of those areas and take advantage of getting synergies there. But beyond that, we also see a very valuable channel. I think there's some things we've learned relative to the CA and the Symantec acquisitions in terms of the value of the channel, and we want to continue to support that channel. And that's going to allow us to support a lot more revenues in a cost-effective way. So we see some real opportunity to leverage that. And then, of course, as you all know, we run G&A at 1% of revenue. We've been integrating companies for a long time. We have tremendous scale. This is going to give us even more significant scale going forward. And we think there's a lot of opportunity there to drive synergies from the redundancies we see. Hock, anything you want to add to that?",

          "content": "Thanks, Tom. Great job explaining it. To address your question directly regarding revenue, there are two dynamics at play. One is our investment strategy and spending priorities. The other is the revenue model; VMware has a significant $3 billion in perpetual on-prem licenses, and we are gradually transitioning these to a subscription model over the next couple of years. This shift may initially lead to a slight dip in reported revenue, but we anticipate a recovery within three years, potentially returning to a growth rate that exceeds mid-single digits, as Tom mentioned. We are preparing for this transition. Economically, whether a license is perpetual or subscription is essentially the same, but we want to ensure our approach aligns with our operational model. Consequently, we are restructuring both our perpetual and subscription contracts. At the start, you might notice slower growth, if any, which will be followed by a faster growth phase as we move more licenses to subscription.",

          "content": "Yes. No, certainly. I mean if you think about it, from a go-to-market standpoint, that's where software companies spend the bulk of their dollars. The fact that we're going to go from $5-plus billion of software revenue to much closer to $20 billion is a big deal. And the fact that we can leverage the combined go-to-market engine at that scale gives us huge economies. I think what we're going to be able to do is marry effectively a direct sales force which covers the largest couple of thousand customers. These are large multinationals across all the key verticals, primarily focused in North America and Europe, but also in parts of Asia with a very significant channel partner arrangements. I think one thing we've learned is there's an opportunity to embrace the channel, the 2-tier distribution model, distribution partners, and key value-added resellers. There's also a big GSI opportunity. We worked significantly with GSIs on our side, so does VMware. And so when I look at that in its totality, what we can't do today, given our scale, we can definitely take advantage of with the newfound scale between the 2 companies. Beyond that, when you think about the R&D side of the equation, to dig deeper into it and follow up when we talked about with Ross. When you think about what supports the development of software, there's a lot of what we refer to sometimes as central engineering. So software business operations, this is the continuous delivery, continuous testing capability, the ability to continuously develop applications on a consistent basis, that's expensive. It requires having your own private data centers or working with cloud providers, and having the scale to be able to drive that kind of R&D investment over a much larger portfolio is also going to drive significant benefits. So hopefully, that helps answer your question. Hock, you want to add anything?",

Could you elaborate on how your business model is evolving, particularly regarding these smaller customers?

Yes, Stacy, a lot of it is based on the portfolio and the breadth of capability that VMware has relative to where we sit today. You're right. When we bought CA, mainframe made up at least half of the revenues. Today's mainframe is still about 50% of the overall software business at Broadcom. That's very much levered toward about 500 accounts in what we call our strategic account area, which is a direct sales motion. And that's also where we saw a lot of opportunity to drive customer synergy with Symantec, particularly around some of the Blue Coat and DLP activities that we were driving. So that was the business model that made sense. That, of course, meant we could drive operating margins, frankly, slightly north of 70% because we didn't have to invest as much in our go-to-market motion. I think with VMware, when we look at it and we look at the fact that vSphere, going back to the core, serves over 300,000 customers, and we look at the growth that the company is driving with their more modern applications, whether it be for private cloud or public cloud, we see a much bigger opportunity. And so to support that opportunity, we need to invest in sales and marketing. So when you think about the 60s EBITDA margins that I was discussing, I think I said mid-60s. That's on a much bigger scale, but at a lower EBITDA margin profile that we're running today. All of that variance is going back into the sales and marketing investment. And we think from learning about how we managed and Symantec, and frankly some of the revenues that we gave up, we think we can actually go back and reinvest in the channel and continue to drive revenue growth profitably. We don't want to walk away from the channel. We actually want to embrace it.",

Regarding the long tail of 300,000 customers, we view this positively, ensuring they receive adequate support. This remains a business base that will grow, and we will address these customers through partners, such as distributors, resellers, and GSI partners. This will simplify our business model.

This trend has been evolving over the past five years, where merchant silicon has been gaining traction over proprietary solutions. Merchant solutions facilitate the separation of hardware and software, leading to greater resilience and flexibility for customers. Initially, this began with hyperscale environments, but it is now extending to service providers and enterprises.  The current acceleration may be linked to the fact that enterprises, after a period of investment hiatus from 2019 through the pandemic, are now reinvesting and modernizing their data centers. They are looking toward the next generation of solutions. We are witnessing increased demand for our Tomahawk 3 and 4 products, along with the latest versions of Trident and Jericho2c, and the introduction of Qumran at the edge. The adoption rates we are seeing are outpacing what we would expect under typical growth conditions.  In simpler terms, we are capturing market share in merchant silicon against proprietary solutions, and this trend, which has been building for five years, is now more pronounced. Regarding supply chain concerns, I often get asked about this, and I want to be clear: over the past year, we have faced challenges in meeting demand promptly with what our customers want. However, we do not see a supply issue; rather, it is a continuous challenge to meet ongoing demand. We have significantly increased our backlog in the last three months, even with lead times remaining unchanged.  Demand continues to come in for our products, particularly in areas like infrastructure, including hyperscale, telecommunications, service providers, and enterprises. In the enterprise space, we are seeing increased demand for subsystems instead of just chips, which greatly enhances our content. Demand remains robust in these two areas, and we are experiencing not just accelerating revenue but also increasing bookings.

When issues arose, customers had to rely on support without understanding the inner workings of the system. We are moving towards a model that separates hardware from software. While we might not know everything about systems, we definitely understand the technology that powers them, whether it's switches, routers, computing, or storage. This is Broadcom's approach to disaggregating hardware and software. Together, we believe we are more powerful than when we are apart. I hope this addresses your question.",

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you everyone for joining today. I feel somewhat surreal here with what I'm about to report and go through in my presentation. Let me start by saying, while consumer IT hardware spending has been reported to be weak, very weak, from our vantage point, infrastructure spending is still very much holding. In our fiscal Q3 '22, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.5 billion, up 25% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 32% year-on-year to $6.6 billion and infrastructure software revenue grew 5% year-on-year to be $1.8 billion. In Q3, our semiconductor business was robust, with solid contributions from all our end markets. Cloud and service provider growth remained strong, and in Q4 is actually expected to accelerate year-on-year, driven by data center build-out and infrastructure upgrades. Year-on-year, enterprise continued to grow for the sixth consecutive quarter on campus deployments and data center refreshes. Looking at Q4, we expect enterprise to continue to grow double-digit percent year-over-year. Meanwhile, in wireless, which is very much tied to our large North American OEM, it was solid in Q3 and is expected to grow in Q4 as we ramp the new platform. Now, let me provide more color by end market. Starting with networking. Networking revenue was a record $2.3 billion and was up 30% year-on-year, representing 35% of our semiconductor revenue. As both cloud and enterprise data centers refresh, they continue to increase adoption of our Tomahawk, Trident and Jericho switching silicon platforms. Importantly, we expect these trends to continue. In mid-August, Broadcom announced the Tomahawk 5 switch series, providing 51.2 terabits per second of Ethernet switching capacity in a single monolithic device, double the bandwidth of any other switch silicon available in the market today. We also announced the industry's first silicon photonics co-packaged with the Tomahawk, which will enable a new benchmark for low power, and extend our leadership and innovation in hyperscale data centers. Networking remains strong, given these drivers. And in Q4, we expect this segment to be up 30% year-over-year. Next, server storage connectivity revenue was a record $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor sales, as growth of 70% year-on-year exceeded our expectations. A primary driver remained the growth of our next-generation service storage connectivity where we benefited from high content and continued deployment of servers and storage in both cloud and enterprises. We anticipate this strong trend to actually continue. And in Q4, we expect server storage connectivity revenue to grow about 45% year-on-year. Moving on to broadband. Revenue of $1.1 billion grew 20% year-on-year, in line with our expectations and represented 17% of semiconductor sales. This steady growth was driven by major service providers continuing to deploy next-generation broadband fiber to the home globally, with high attach rates of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E. We are the industry leader in investing in the next generation Wi-Fi 7 and unlocking amazing wireless experiences across home gateways, enterprise access points and smartphones, and we expect first deployments to occur in the second half of 2023. In Q4, we expect our broadband business to grow above 20% year-on-year. Finally, moving to wireless. Q3 revenue of $1.6 billion represented 25% of our semiconductor revenue. Sustained demand from North American customers drove wireless revenue up 14% year-on-year, in line with our guidance. In Q4, we expect wireless revenue to be seasonally up 20% sequentially and grow 10% year-on-year. Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $244 million declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting weakness in China, partially offset by continued strength in the U.S. and Europe. Nonetheless, for Q4, we forecast industrial resales to rebound to high-single-digit growth year-on-year. In summary, Q3 semiconductor solution revenue was up 32% year-on-year. In Q4, we expect semiconductor revenue to remain strong at 25% year-on-year. Now, putting this in perspective, and if we look at it on a sequential basis, Q3 grew 6% as did Q2, and Q4 will grow another 6%, largely driven by the seasonality of wireless. Turning to software. In Q3, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. In dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 128% over expiring contracts, and for strategic accounts, we averaged 140%. Within these strategic accounts, annual bookings of $461 million include $136 million of cross-selling of our portfolio products to these core customers. Now, 95% of our renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. And just to put all this in context, over the past 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 122% over expiring contracts. And within strategic accounts, we averaged 137%. Because of these trends, our ARR and the indicator of forward software revenue at the end of Q3 was $5.5 billion, which was up 5% from a year ago. And in Q4, we expect our infrastructure software revenue to sustain around mid-single-digit percentage growth year-over-year. In summary, therefore, we're guiding consolidated Q4 revenue of $8.9 billion, up 20% year-on-year or 5% sequentially. Now, before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We're making good progress with our various regulatory filings around the world. We have an excellent team focused on this effort, and we are moving forward as expected in this regard. We continue to expect the transaction to be completed in Broadcom's fiscal year 2023. We remain excited about our acquisition of VMware and continue to be impressed by the world-class engineering talent as well as strong customer and channel partnerships. We have tremendous respect for what VMware has built. And together, we will enable enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing the most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $8.5 billion for the quarter, up 25% from a year ago. Gross margins were 76% of revenue in the quarter and up 80 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 8% year-on-year, driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $5.2 billion, up 32% from a year ago. Operating margin was 61% of revenue, up approximately 320 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.4 billion or 63.5% of revenue. Note that this figure excludes $129 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our two segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $6.6 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 32% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 72%, up 220 basis points year-on-year, driven by favorable product mix and content growth in next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $853 million in Q3, up 9% year-on-year. R&D was $765 million in the quarter, up 10% year-on-year. Q3 semiconductor operating margins increased to 59%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 32%, operating profit grew 44%. Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion and represented 22% of revenue. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter and were stable year-over-year. Operating expenses were $375 million in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 70% in Q3, and operating profit grew 5%. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.3 billion, representing 51% of revenue. We spent $116 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 29 days in the third quarter compared to 30 days a year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, up 10% from the end of the prior quarter, in large part due to higher material costs and the expected sequential revenue ramp. We ended the third quarter with $10 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $304 million is short-term. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.7 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock and eliminated $292 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of approximately 3.2 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q3 was 436 million. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 435 million, which excludes the potential impact of any share repurchases completed in the fourth quarter. We have not repurchased any of our shares since we announced the pending acquisition of VMware, as repurchases are subject to regulatory rules. We maintain our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, including buybacks, as soon as we can under SEC rules. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 is for consolidated revenues of $8.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63% of projected revenue. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

None of our products are affected by any recent restrictions on shipments to China. We have not been impacted at all, and we do not expect to be. Regarding your point, while that involves some speculation, I maintain that the long-term sustainable demand in the semiconductor space is a mid-single-digit compounded growth rate, around 5% or maybe 6%. I still believe that, despite the marketing excitement over the past year. This has always been the case, and I think we will eventually revert to that norm. What we are observing is indeed interesting because it depends on the starting point for that compounded growth. The 5% I mentioned is the long-term growth rate. In the short term, as we all know, during up cycles, growth can exceed 5%, and during down cycles, it can fall below that, averaging out to 5%. Your point stands that eventually, we will return to the norm, though I don\u2019t see that happening this year. In 2022, we are projecting a year-on-year growth rate for semiconductors of around 25% in Q4, which is significantly above the 5% norm. So yes, things will eventually turn around and revert back to that norm, though it may take a couple of years to get there.",

Maintaining that just keeps our gross margin percentage stable. Therefore, price increases have minimal impact on our margin improvement. What has allowed our margins to accelerate, as I noted in the last earnings call, is the pent-up level of spending we've seen, notably in enterprise and somewhat in cloud and broadband, alongside the adoption of next-generation products and technology. This consistently enhances our gross margin. It\u2019s a fundamental aspect of the semiconductor cycle: the new generation of products boosts and expands our gross margin, and the accelerated adoption is what drives this gross margin growth.

So, when you think of sustainability of that semi business up in the 70s, what do you think are some of the drivers that keep it up there for you guys, longer term?",

          "content": "Let me address the second question first as it\u2019s a bit more complex, though quite straightforward. Our semiconductor gross margin continues to expand rather than remain static. Looking back five years, we operated with margins in the low to mid-60s, but today we are above 70%. This is a hallmark of the semiconductor technology business, as new product generations emerge regularly\u2014every 12 to 24 months for wireless, every 2 to 3 years for switching, and every 5 years for storage. With each new generation, we enhance our margins by delivering increased value, allowing us to achieve higher prices and profitability. As we introduce new generations, our portfolio margins keep growing. Currently, we are in the 70s. Regarding where we may be in five years, I anticipate this gross margin expansion will persist. While I can't provide a specific mathematical formula, our portfolio of about 16 semiconductor franchises has historically demonstrated an annual average expansion of 50 to 100 basis points. We expect this trend to continue. In the past two years, we've witnessed a rebound driven by changes in IT spending linked to lockdowns and COVID-19 behavioral shifts, which accelerated the adoption of next-generation products across many of our franchises, enhancing our semiconductor gross margin. However, I believe things will revert to a more normalized expansion of 50 to 100 basis points once the current excitement subsides. Despite this, we foresee sustainable expansion in our semiconductor gross margin. In software, while we can't maintain 90% margins indefinitely, we believe semiconductor margins will keep rising. Lastly, regarding your first question about China, it constitutes about 13% of our semiconductor revenue.",

Based on indications from your foundry supplier and key substrate suppliers, from a modeling perspective, should we expect mid-single-digit growth to be kind of the normal cadence over the next few or several quarters, or could there be a point in time where your rate of growth starts to accelerate, given easing in some of the other end markets?

For the October quarter, we've increased from 8.4 to 8.9. This is largely driven by the seasonal ramp of our North American handset manufacturer, which accounts for that rise. We're closely aligned with the end consumption of products, and it's not primarily about supply.

          "content": "Let me explain this. Your question is about the pace of adoption across all our product lines, especially in semiconductors, where we have new generations of products that are quite impressive. However, adoption tends to be slower than we would like. For example, in data center switching, we're still selling earlier versions like Tomahawk 1 and 2 alongside Tomahawk 3, which was released before our current generation. To give you an idea, Tomahawk 4 accounts for less than 30% of my total sales in that line. This shows that multiple generations often coexist, and this is likely to continue. When we launch Tomahawk 5 in two years, we'll still see Tomahawk 1 sales declining only slightly. This coexistence is the norm across all our products, including server storage, where multiple generations are simultaneously available due to the gradual pace of technology adoption. We tend to see a mix rather than a clear winner emerging, as there is always a shared volume of different technologies. In the consumer market, the adoption can be faster, but we still see 2 or 3 generations of our North American OEM products running at the same time. With infrastructure products, however, adoption takes longer and it's common to have three generations in the market at once. This means that any increases in gross margin are impacted by the mix of product generations. Therefore, our gross margin increases gradually, at a rate of about 50 to 100 basis points each year as newer generations are adopted steadily. I hope that addresses your question.",

          "content": "Well, thank you, Ji. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Before I provide color on our Q4 results, let me put in perspective what we achieved in fiscal year \u201822. For the year, I\u2019m pleased to report that consolidated revenue hit a record of $33.2 billion, growing 21% year-on-year, yet another year of double-digit organic growth. This growth was driven by our strong partnerships with customers and increased R&D investments, which enable accelerated adoption of our next-generation technologies. With our robust business model, we grew our fiscal 2022 operating profit by 28% year-on-year and our free cash flow per share by 25% year-on-year. Now to discuss details of our fiscal Q4. In our fiscal Q4 \u201822, consolidated net revenue was a record $8.9 billion, up 21% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 26% year-on-year to $7.1 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 4% year-on-year to $1.8 billion. In Q4, our semiconductor business continued to perform well across hyperscale, service providers, and enterprise. On top of this, wireless grew sequentially as we ramp up the new platform with our North American customer. In reporting these results, I\u2019d like to emphasize we demonstrate our continued discipline in shipping our strong backlog only as and when needed by our end customers. So, in contrast to weak consumer electronics spending today and despite concerns of a global recession, we believe overall infrastructure spending remains strong, and we continue to experience sustained demand in most of our end markets, and this is what we continue to see in Q1. So, let me expand on this. Starting with networking. Networking revenue was a record $2.5 billion and was up 30% year-on-year, representing 35% of our semiconductor revenue. We see strong growth from the deployment of Tomahawk 4 for data center switching at hyperscale customers. And we see upgrades of edge and core routing networks with our next-generation Jericho portfolio at cloud and service providers. At multiple cloud customers, we continue to lead in delivering custom solutions for compute offload accelerators and actually surpassed the $2 billion amount in revenues in fiscal \u201822. Looking into Q1, we do expect networking revenue to be strong and grow about 20% year-over-year. Next, our storage connectivity revenue was a record $1.2 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and up 50% year-on-year. As we have mentioned in previous earnings calls, we are benefiting here from substantial content increases as both cloud and enterprise customers adopt our next-generation MegaRAID and storage adapters. This trend will continue in Q1, and we expect server storage connectivity revenue to grow above 50% year-on-year. Moving on to broadband. Revenue of $1 billion grew 20% year-on-year and represented 15% of semiconductor revenue. Our broadband business is benefiting from ongoing multiyear deployments by North American and European service providers of 10-gigabit PON and DOCSIS 3.1 with embedded Wi-Fi 6 and 6E. In Q1, we expect the secular drivers behind broadband to continue and our business to be strong at about 30% year-on-year growth. Moving on to wireless. Q4 revenue of $2.1 billion represented 29% of semiconductor revenue with the 13% year-on-year increase coming largely from higher content. In Q1, we expect wireless revenue to be sequentially flat and up low single digits year-on-year. Finally, Q4 industrial resale of $234 million grew 1% year-on-year as softness in China mostly offset the strength in North American and European automotive. In Q1, we forecast industrial resales to continue the trend of low single-digit percent growth year-on-year. And so in summary, Q4 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 26% year-on-year. And in Q1, we expect semiconductor revenue growth to sustain at approximately 20% year-on-year. Moving on to software. In Q4, infrastructure software revenue of $1.8 billion grew 4% year-on-year and represented 21% of total revenue. Core software revenue grew 5% year-on-year. In spite of adverse forex impact in dollar terms, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% of expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 128%. Within our strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $357 million included $101 million of cross-selling our portfolio of products to these customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscriptions and maintenance. Over the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 120% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 135%. Because of this, our ARR, which is annual recurring revenue, the indicator of forward revenue, at the end of Q4 was $5.4 billion, which was up 4% from a year ago. And in Q1, we expect our infrastructure software segment revenue to be flat year-on-year, reflecting core software revenue growth of mid-single-digit percent year-over-year, offset by a year-on-year decline in the Brocade enterprise and business. In summary, we\u2019re guiding consolidated Q1 revenue of $8.9 billion, up 16% year-on-year. While we are fully booked for fiscal 2023, in this environment, we are not providing you guidance for the year. Before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We are making progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, as we very much expect to have received merger clearance in Brazil, Canada and South Africa. We anticipate that the timeline for the review process will be more extended in other key regions, especially given the size of this transaction. Having said that, we\u2019re still confident that this transaction will close and be completed in our fiscal 2023. The combination of Broadcom and VMware is about enabling enterprises to accelerate innovation and expand choice by addressing their most complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud era. And we are confident that regulators will see this when they conclude their review.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 21% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75% of revenue in the quarter and up 10 basis points year-on-year. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, up 3% year-on-year, driven by investment in R&D. Operating income for the quarter was $5.5 billion and was up 25% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 240 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 64% of revenue. This figure excludes $129 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our two reportable segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.1 billion and represented 79% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 26% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 71%, up 70 basis points year-on-year driven by product mix and adoption of next-generation products across our extensive product portfolio. Operating expenses were $825 million in Q4, up 4% year-on-year. R&D was $731 million in the quarter, up 4% year-on-year. Q4 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. So, while semiconductor revenue was up 26%, operating profit grew 33% year-on-year. Moving to the P&L for the infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $1.8 billion, up 4% year-on-year and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 91% in the quarter and operating expenses were $348 million in the quarter, down 1% year-on-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 72% in Q4, and operating profit grew 6%. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.5 billion, representing 50% of revenue. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the fourth quarter compared to 29 days in the third quarter. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 5% from the end of the prior quarter because we expect the mix of revenue in Q1 to have a higher cost of materials. We ended the fourth quarter with $12.4 billion of cash and $39.5 billion of gross debt, of which $440 million is short term. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.9 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 63% of projected revenue. In forecasting such operating profitability, we would like to point out that because of product mix changes, our non-GAAP gross margin could be down roughly 100 basis points from Q4 and R&D spending could be up sequentially as we step up hiring of engineers for multiple critical projects. Let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2022. Our revenue hit a record $33.2 billion, growing 21% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue was $25.8 billion, up 27% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $7.4 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 76%, up 110 basis points from a year ago. Our operating expenses were $4.8 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Fiscal '22 operating income was $20.3 billion, up 28% year-over-year and represented 61% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $21 billion, up 27% year-over-year and represented 63% of net revenue. This figure excludes $529 million of depreciation. We spent $424 million on capital expenditures. And free cash flow grew 22% year-on-year to $16.3 billion or 49% of fiscal '22 revenue. Turning to capital allocation. For fiscal '22, we spent $15.5 billion, consisting of $7 billion in the form of cash dividends and $8.5 billion in repurchases and eliminations. We ended the year with $13 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining and expect to resume our repurchase of common stock as soon as we can under SEC rules. Excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q1, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be $435 million. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2023 to $4.60 per share, an increase of 12% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '23, subject to quarterly Board approval. This implies our fiscal 2023 annual common stock dividend to be a record $18.40 per share. I would like to highlight that this represents the 12th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. That concludes my prepared remarks.

Based on our assessment of customers' willingness to accept and consume the products we ship, that\u2019s our current situation. Regarding the rest of 2023, I am more cautious in providing an answer. I cannot predict if the strong demand for our products will continue throughout the year. However, in the next several months, we still see existing orders and customers willing to take our products. We have spoken with numerous CIOs from our largest enterprise clients, and none have indicated plans to reduce their IT spending. Many suggest that their spending will grow, while others expect it to remain flat. Therefore, I am cautiously optimistic about upcoming trends.",

For instance, one quarter we might see broadband growing 20% year-on-year and networking growing 30% year-on-year, while in the next quarter those figures might flip to broadband growing 30% and networking growing 20%. This fluctuation is affected not only by hyperscale customers making purchases in a seasonal manner but also by the specific end markets involved.

It's too early for me to provide a clear view on Q2 since the period is still a way off, but there are shifts between Q4 and Q1 reflected in our numbers. This means that comparing year-on-year is a good approach. In Q4, the year-on-year figure was 13%, and Q1 actually saw a 1% increase, though there were movements in between. I believe this is related to the logistics challenges caused by COVID for our largest customer, although I can't provide a broader perspective. Regarding Q2, I really cannot offer any insights, as we lack visibility. Now, regarding your question about gross margin, it's entirely influenced by the product mix. Depending on the specific products we ship, the gross margins can vary due to market conditions and the ecosystem in those niche markets. Networking products generally have the highest margins, followed by broadband, while wireless has the lowest. From Q4 to Q1, we shifted away from networking somewhat and moved more towards broadband, with wireless still comprising a significant portion of our sales despite remaining consistent as a percentage. This is why we see a sequential impact on gross margin related solely to the mix of products we sell, as the natural gross margins vary across those products. You can also observe this in the way our inventory has grown. As reported, our inventory at the end of Q4 increased about 5% from the end of Q3, and this Q4 inventory is set to be shipped in Q1, despite our revenue guidance remaining relatively flat.",

If you were to ask me to forecast over the next five years, I would say there is uncertainty about whether these hyperscalers will shift back to using merchant silicon rather than continuing with custom ASICs, which complicates the analysis.

This trend provides an explanation for the lack of a significant reduction in IT spending, even amid discussions of a potential global recession.",

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you all for joining us today. In our fiscal Q1 2023, consolidated net revenue reached $8.9 billion, reflecting a 16% increase compared to the previous year. Revenue from Semiconductor Solutions rose by 21% year-on-year to $7.1 billion. As anticipated, Infrastructure Software revenue fell by 1% year-on-year to $1.8 billion, although our core software saw a growth of 5% year-on-year. Looking back at Q1, we observe that infrastructure spending remains elevated, particularly among service providers, while hyperscale and enterprise spending holds steady. Investment in technology for infrastructure has robustly exhibited double-digit growth for nine consecutive quarters. We are well booked for fiscal 2023, with lead times and visibility on semiconductors staying steady at approximately 50 weeks. Despite a few requests for order delays, these instances are rare and have not significantly affected our business. Since we ship consistently throughout the quarter, our inventory remains stable at around 80 days, and overall inventory of Broadcom products within the ecosystem is well managed. We are committed to shipping our backlog only as needed by our end customers. Now, let\u2019s provide more details on each of our end markets.  Starting with networking, revenue was $2.3 billion, a 20% increase year-on-year, aligning with our guidance and making up 32% of our semiconductor revenue. The advanced Tomahawk switches continue to be deployed by hyperscalers in their leaf and spine architectures. While we are enhancing bandwidth for these hyperscalers, power management remains a significant challenge. Recently, we introduced the industry's first integrated silicon photonics networking solution, code-named Bailey, which combines active optical interconnects with our next-generation Tomahawk 5 switch at 51.2 terabits per second. Bailey enhances switching performance while reducing total system power. Notably, a growing segment of our switches is now utilized within hyperscalers' AI networks, separate from traditional x86 CPU workloads. Looking ahead, we will utilize large-scale, large language models that involve billions of parameters, requiring thousands of AI engines to run synchronously at speeds of 400 gig and 800 gig. The networking infrastructure to support such density is crucial for AI operations. These AI networks are currently being implemented at specific hyperscalers using our Jericho 2 switches and Ramon Fabric. In fact, we estimated that our Ethernet switch shipments for AI deployments exceeded $200 million in 2022, with expectations to rise to over $800 million in 2023 due to increasing demand from hyperscale customers. We foresee this trend accelerating, necessitating even higher performance networks for the future. This drives our investment in a new generation of lossless, low-latency Ethernet fabric designed for demanding AI workloads. Additionally, the booming growth of generative AI is boosting our compute offload accelerated business at hyperscalers, growing to over $2 billion in revenue in 2022, and we are on track to surpass $3 billion in fiscal 2023. In Q2, we expect the positive momentum to contribute to an additional 20% year-over-year growth in networking revenue. Next, our server storage connectivity revenue hit a record $1.3 billion, accounting for 18% of semiconductor revenue, marking a 57% year-on-year increase. As mentioned in previous quarters, the shift towards next-generation megawatt solutions has significantly driven this year-on-year growth. After four consecutive quarters of increases, this transition is now largely complete, and we predict Q2 to see about 20% year-on-year growth in server storage connectivity revenue.  In broadband, revenue grew by 34% year-on-year to a record $1.2 billion, making up 17% of semiconductor revenue. This quarter, our broadband division experienced strong growth from telcos deploying 10G PON and cable operators adopting DOCSIS 3.1. These gateways have high adoption rates for WiFi 6 and 6E. We anticipate the foundational drivers of broadband to maintain momentum in Q2, forecasting a solid 10% year-on-year growth. Now for wireless, Q1 revenue was $2.1 billion, representing 29% of semiconductor revenue. Demand from North American customers resulted in a 4% year-on-year increase in wireless revenue, showcased by content gains highlighted last quarter. Sequentially, wireless revenue was flat compared to Q4 and is expected to see a seasonal dip in Q2 along with a high single-digit percentage decrease year-on-year. Lastly, Q1 industrial resale revenue was $229 million, down 4% year-on-year, as weaknesses in China countered strengths from renewable energy and medical sectors. For Q2, we predict industrial resales to decline by low single-digit percentages year-on-year due to ongoing challenges in China. To summarize, Q1 Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased by 21% year-on-year, and we expect high single-digit percentage growth in semiconductor revenue for Q2. Turning to software, Q1 Infrastructure Software revenue was $1.8 billion, a slight 1% decline year-on-year, which represented 20% of total revenue. Despite a 5% growth in core software, the Brocade business experienced a downturn due to fluctuations in enterprise consumption within a narrow segment of SAN storage. For core software, our renewal rates averaged 119% of expiring contracts, with strategic accounts averaging 129%. The annualized bookings from these strategic accounts totaled $536 million, of which $197 million, or 37%, came from cross-selling our product portfolio. Over 90% of the renewal value was derived from recurring subscriptions and maintenance. Across the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates were 119% for expiring contracts and 134% for strategic accounts. Consequently, our ARR, which indicates future revenue at the end of Q1, stood at $5.3 billion, reflecting a 3% increase from last year. For Q2, we expect our Infrastructure Software segment revenue to rise by low-to-mid single-digit percentages year-on-year, as stable growth in core software is somewhat counterbalanced by weakness in Brocade. In closing, we are guiding for consolidated Q2 revenue of $8.7 billion, an 8% increase year-on-year. Before Kirsten shares additional insights regarding our quarterly financial performance, I want to give a brief update about our pending VMware acquisition. We are making headway with our global regulatory approvals, having secured legal merger clearance in Brazil, South Africa, and Canada, along with foreign investment control clearance in Germany, France, Austria, Denmark, Italy, and New Zealand. As stated in our previous earnings call, we anticipate that the review process might take longer in other regions due to the transaction's size. Nevertheless, we still expect this transaction to finalize within fiscal 2023. We believe that the merger of Broadcom and VMware will aid enterprises in accelerating innovation and expanding choice by addressing their complex technology challenges in this multi-cloud landscape, and we are confident that regulators will recognize this during their review. Lastly, Broadcom recently released its third annual ESG report, which can be found on our corporate citizenship website, outlining our commitments to positively impacting our customers, employees, and communities through innovative products and operational excellence. We remain dedicated to this mission.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Broadcom had another great quarter with robust financials. Consolidated revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 16% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74% of revenue in the quarter, about 10 basis points higher than we expected. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 1% year-on-year. R&D of $929 million was also down 1% year-on-year, primarily from streamlined project and other variable spending, offset in part by higher people costs resulting from increased headcount as we are hiring. Operating income for the quarter was $5.4 billion and was up 17% from a year ago. Operating margin was 61% of revenue, up approximately 50 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 64% of revenue. This figure excludes $127 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two reportable segments. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $7.1 billion and represented 80% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 21% year-on-year. As Hock discussed, this came from strength across all of our semiconductor end markets. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 69%, down approximately 160 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $802 million in Q1, down 2% year-on-year. R&D was $716 million in the quarter, down 1% year-on-year. Q1 semiconductor operating margins were 58%. So while semiconductor revenue was up 21%, operating profit grew 23% year-on-year. Moving to the P&L for our Infrastructure Software reportable segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $1.8 billion, down 1% year-on-year and represented 20% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 91% in the quarter and operating expenses were $346 million in the quarter, down 1% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software operating margin was 72% in Q1 and operating profit was stable year-on-year. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $3.9 billion, representing a 16% increase year-over-year. Free cash flow represented 44% of revenues in Q1 2023 consistent with what we achieved the same quarter last year. We spent $103 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 33 days in the first quarter compared to 30 days in the fourth quarter. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, down 1% from the end of the prior quarter or 78 days on hand. Overall, inventory of Broadcom\u2019s products across the ecosystem, as Hock indicated, remains well managed. We ended the first quarter with $12.6 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt of which $1.1 billion is short-term. During the quarter, we repaid $260 million in senior notes that were due on maturity. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 10.2 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation, in the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock and eliminated $333 million of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 2.7 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q1 was $434 million. As of the end of Q1, $11.8 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. Excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q2, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be 438 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.7 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 64.5% of projected revenue. In forecasting such profitability, we expect gross margins to be up approximately 150 basis points sequentially on product mix and R&D spending to be up sequentially on continuing hiring of engineers and seasonal payroll tax step-ups.

I wanted to understand the difference between what you are doing in AI so far versus maybe what our understanding of generative is. You talked about $200 million in Ethernet related to AI, is that largely generative, because we have heard other companies say that for large part, the generative models are using InfiniBand and then you talked about $2 billion in compute offload going to sort of $3 billion. My understanding was that was mostly for video processing. Maybe help us think about how we think of Avago\u2019s place or Broadcom\u2019s place in the generative process?",

          "content": "Thank you for the question and the chance to clarify why we emphasized this point. In 2022, generative AI was just beginning to emerge, and while AI networks were already present in hyperscale environments in significant amounts, we wanted to draw a parallel to traditional CPUs used in regular workloads in these data centers. We have faced limitations with the performance of silicon CPUs, and as Moore's Law begins to wane, we are seeing buyers scale up by positioning rows of server CPUs and networking them to function closely in parallel. As we transition to large language models in AI, particularly generative AI, GPUs are being connected in hundreds, soon to be thousands, of racks and are working together in parallel. These GPUs operate synchronously to perform what we refer to as bulk parametric exchange, running various AI engines\u2014whether they are GPUs, TPUs, or other AI types\u2014together in a network. This network is becoming an essential aspect of the AI landscape in hardware. To enable this, we must assemble numerous racks of AI engines working in parallel, much like hyperscalers have done with CPUs to enhance their performance, as Moore's Law reaches its limits and presents similar constraints with AI engines made from silicon. Therefore, the network plays a crucial role in realizing the potential of generative AI. In 2022, we estimate that AI workloads in hyperscale environments accounted for around $200 million worth of silicon, Ethernet switches, and fabric in those AI networks. With the rise of generative AI and the excitement surrounding it, we are witnessing a significant increase in demand. Our hyperscale customers are eager to secure products and ensure they can establish highly efficient, low-latency networks that can scale, and Ethernet is key to that scalability.",

But from a new product ramp and design win funnel perspective, is this also causing your cloud customers to want to pull forward some of your future programs like Tomahawk 5 or Jericho 3 next-gen switching and routing products and/or pulling the design and tape out of their next-generation compute offload AI ASIC programs?",

As you evaluate the workload, what percentage do you anticipate will be related to generative AI by the end of 2023 or in 2024? Additionally, I want to ask about the silicon photonics side. You briefly mentioned the silicon photonics cable with the integrated switch, which has a capacity of 51.2 terabytes.

It's still in the early stages, but we definitely see a strong sense of urgency among our customers, particularly in the hyperscale environment, to keep up with this trend. With generative AI, the models are using billions more parameters. We're seeing data centers scale out their AI engines in a way we haven't experienced before. This is a solvable challenge, as we are already providing technology to support AI networks for some hyperscalers, where we're managing hundreds or thousands of AI engines working synchronously. The focus is on scaling effectively and ensuring we don't become a bottleneck to achieving optimal performance in AI data centers. The current challenge lies in networking and conducting massive data exchanges while operating large numbers of machines in parallel. Since we are still in the early stages, we believe we have time to develop a new generation of Ethernet switches specifically tailored for these unique workloads, which differ significantly from traditional data center tasks. These switches need to be virtually lossless, low latency, and capable of scaling to thousands of engines. We are actively working on silicon solutions to meet these criteria and aim to enhance the performance of our existing technology in anticipation of the trends we foresee in the coming years.",

Looking at your networking division, if you achieve at least $600 million growth in AI and $1 billion growth in compute, that could represent all your growth in networking.

Outside of Broadcom, we've observed that memory and x86 CPU servers are currently struggling, although we expect a recovery in the second half of the year. In contrast, the GPU market is performing well and is accelerating. My question is whether it's accurate to say that only AI is growing in large data centers this year, and whether this indicates future trends, or if you believe that the general-purpose infrastructure centered around x86 or similar CPUs still has a strong growth potential.",

The main focus is on delivering essential broadband services to every household, and we are witnessing a lot of deployment activity. Additionally, we are observing a strong and ongoing deployment of cable infrastructure using DOCSIS technology, as cable operators adapt to remain competitive with the telcos deploying 10-gigabit PON. This competitive pressure necessitates updates in DOCSIS technology to prevent subscriber loss. We see robust demand for both DOCSIS 3.1 and the anticipated but not yet widespread DOCSIS 4. Meanwhile, PON technology is gaining traction, which explains our strong performance last quarter and sustained strength over the previous quarters. This growth is enhanced by high attach rates of WiFi 6 and 6E accompanying many of these deployments, contributing further to our broadband revenue growth.

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. So, in our fiscal Q2 2023, consolidated net revenue was $8.7 billion, up 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor Solutions revenue increased 9% year-on-year to $6.8 billion. And Infrastructure Software grew 3% year-on-year to $1.9 billion as the stable growth in core software more than offset softness in the Brocade business. Now, as I start this call, I know you all want to hear about how we are benefiting from this strong deployment of generative AI by our customers. Put this in perspective, our revenue today from this opportunity represents about 15% of our semiconductor business. Having said this, it was only 10% in fiscal '22. And we believe it could be over 25% of semiconductor revenue in fiscal '24. In fact, over the course of fiscal '23 that we're in, we are seeing a trajectory where our quarterly revenue entering the year doubles by the time we exceed '23. And in fiscal third quarter '23, we expect this revenue to exceed $1 billion in the quarter. But, as you well know, we are also a broadly diversified semiconductor and infrastructure software company. And in our fiscal Q2, demand for IT infrastructure was driven by hyperscale, while service providers and enterprise continued to hold up. Following the 30% year-on-year increases we have experienced over the past five quarters, overall IT infrastructure demand in Q2 moderated to mid-teens percentage growth year-on-year. As we have always told you, we continue to ship only to end-user demand. We remain very disciplined on how we manage inventory across our ecosystem. We exited the quarter with less than 86 days on hand, a level of inventory consistent with what we have maintained over the past eight quarters. Now, let me give you more color on our end markets. Let me begin with wireless. As you saw in our recent 8-K filing, we entered into a multiyear collaboration with a North American wireless OEM on cutting-edge wireless connectivity and 5G components. Our engagement in technology and supply remains deep, strategic, and long term. Q2 wireless revenue of $1.6 billion represented 23% of semiconductor revenue. Wireless revenue declined seasonally, down 24% quarter-on-quarter and down 9% year-on-year. In Q3, as we just begin the seasonal ramp of the next-generation phone platform, we expect wireless revenue to be up low single digits sequentially. We expect however, it will remain around flattish year-on-year. Moving on to networking. Networking revenue was $2.6 billion and was up 20% year-on-year, in line with guidance, representing 39% of our semiconductor revenue. There are two growth drivers here. One, continued strength in deployment of our merchant Tomahawk switching for traditional enterprise workloads as well as Jericho routing platforms for telcos; and two, strong growth in AI infrastructure at hyperscalers from compute offload and networking. And speaking of AI networks, Broadcom\u2019s next-generation Ethernet switching portfolio consisting of Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI offers the industry's highest performance fabric for large-scale AI clusters by optimizing the demanding and costly AI resources. These switches based on an open distributed disaggregated architecture will support 32,000 GPU clusters running at 800 gigabit per second bandwidth. Ethernet fabric, as we know it, already supports multi-tenancy capability and end-to-end congestion management. This lossless connectivity with high QoS performance has been well proven over the last 10 years of network deployment in the public cloud and telcos. In other words, the technology is not new. And we are, as Broadcom, very well positioned to simply extend our best-in-class networking technology into generative AI infrastructure while supporting standard connectivity, which enables vendor interoperability. In Q3, we expect networking revenue to maintain its growth year-on-year of around 20%. Next, our server storage connectivity revenue was $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and up 20% year-on-year. And as we noted last quarter, with the transition to next-generation MegaRAID largely completed and enterprise demand moderating, we expect server storage connectivity revenue in Q3 to be up low single digits year-on-year. Moving on to broadband. Revenue grew 10% year-on-year to $1.2 billion and represented 18% of semiconductor revenue. Growth in broadband was driven by continued deployments by telcos of next-generation 10G PON and cable operators of DOCSIS 3.1 with high attach rates of Wi-Fi 6 and 6E. And in Q3, we expect our broadband growth to moderate to low-single-digit percent year-on-year. And finally, Q2 industrial resales of $260 million increased 2% year-on-year as the softness in China was offset by strength globally in renewable energy and robotics. And in Q3, we forecast industrial resales to be flattish year-on-year on continuing softness in Asia, offset by strength in Europe. So summary, Q2 Semiconductor Solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year. And in Q3, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of mid-single-digit year-on-year growth. Turning to software. In Q2, Infrastructure Software revenue of $1.9 billion grew 3% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. As expected, continued softness in Brocade was offset by the continuing stable growth in core software. Relating to core software, consolidated renewal rates averaged 114% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we averaged 120%. Within the strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $564 million included $133 million or 23% of cross-selling of other portfolio products to these same core customers. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. And over the last 12 months, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts. And among our strategic accounts, we averaged 128%. Because of this, our ARR, the indicator of forward revenue at the end of Q2 was $5.3 billion, up 2% from a year ago. And in Q3, we expect our Infrastructure Software segment revenue to be up low single digits percentage year-on-year as the core software growth continues to be offset by weakness in Brocade. On a consolidated basis, we're guiding Q3 revenue of $8.85 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We're making good progress with our various regulatory filings around the world, having received legal merger clearance in Australia, Brazil, Canada, South Africa, and Taiwan and foreign investment control clearance in all necessary jurisdictions. We still expect the transaction will close in Broadcom's fiscal 2023.

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $8.7 billion for the quarter, up 8% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75.6% of revenue in the quarter, about 30 basis points higher than we expected on product mix. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, down 4% year-on-year. R&D of $958 million was also down 4% year-on-year on lower variable spending. Operating income for the quarter was $5.4 billion and was up 10% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.7 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $129 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our two segments. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $6.8 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 9% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 71%, down approximately 120 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $833 million in Q2, down 5% year-on-year. R&D was $739 million in the quarter, down 4% year-on-year. Q2 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. So, while semiconductor revenue was up 9%, operating profit grew 10% year-on-year. Moving to the P&L for our Infrastructure Software segment. Revenue for Infrastructure Software was $1.9 billion, up 3% year-on-year and represented 22% of revenue. Gross margins for Infrastructure Software were 92% in the quarter and operating expenses were $361 million in the quarter, down 3% year-over-year. Infrastructure Software operating margin was 73% in Q2, and operating profit grew 8% year-on-year. Moving to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.4 billion and represented 50% of revenues in Q2. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 32 days in the second quarter compared to 33 days in the first quarter. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, down 1% from the end of the prior quarter. We ended the second quarter with $11.6 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed rate debt is 3.61% and 9.9 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 billion of cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $2.8 billion of our common stock and eliminated $614 million of common stock for taxes due on the vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 5.6 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q2 was $435 million. As of the end of Q2, $9 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. Excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, in Q3, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be $438 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $8.85 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 65% of projected revenue. In Q3, we expect gross margins to be down approximately 60 basis points sequentially on product mix. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

How you've seen the demand evolve during the course of your quarter? Has it accelerated, in what areas, et cetera? And is there any competitive implications for it? We've heard from some of the compute folks that they want to do more on the networking side. And then obviously, you want to do more into the compute side.

I just wanted to make sure if there is any specific update to those numbers. Is it more than $4 billion in total now, et cetera? And then my question is, longer term, what do you think the share is going to be between kind of general-purpose GPU-type solutions versus ASICs? Do you think that share shifts towards ASICs? Do you think it shifts towards general purpose solutions? Because if I look outside of the compute offload opportunity, you have generally favored, right, more the general-purpose market.

This is not a detailed forecast but rather a sense of an accelerated trend from '22 through '24. Regarding the specific numbers you've mentioned, we stand by our fiscal '23 forecast of 3.8%, as it's still early for any revision. As for your broader question about ASICs versus merchant solutions, I generally prefer merchant options, whether in computing or networking, as I believe they have a better chance of succeeding in the long run.

This segment is very stable, and based on our historical renewal patterns with an expanding customer base, we can drive this growth in a stable manner. The growth rate is very predictable, and we're satisfied with it. Additionally, we have Brocade's fiber channel SAN business, which, while also part of our software offerings, is primarily enterprise-driven and tends to be cyclical. Last year was a robust up cycle for this segment, but this year, the cycles are not as strong, especially when compared to last year\u2019s strong performance. The combination of these factors is what we are currently experiencing. However, I believe that next year could see a turnaround, potentially leading Brocade to improve. Instead of a 3% year-on-year growth in the entire segment, we could achieve high single-digit growth, as I have previously noted that you should plan for long-term mid-single-digit growth in core software revenues, which remain a very predictable aspect of our financials.",

Currently, we mainly see hyperscale companies deploying generative AI infrastructure at scale. Enterprises continue to use standard x86 servers and Ethernet networking in their traditional data centers. What we're observing may just be the beginning of a larger cycle, which is why I cannot provide a definitive view on the attach rate, the ratio, or any potential stability in the near term.

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3 2023 consolidated net revenue, we achieved $8.9 billion, up 5% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 5% year-on-year to $6.9 billion and infrastructure software grew 5% year-on-year to $1.9 billion. Hyperscale continued to grow double-digits year-on-year, but enterprise and telco spending moderated. Meanwhile, virtually defying gravity, our wireless business has remained stable. Now generative AI investments are driving the continued strength in hyperscale spending for us. As you know, we supply a major hyperscale customer with custom AI compute engines. We are also supplying several hyperscalers with a portfolio of networking technologies as they scale up and scale out their AI clusters within their data centers. Now representing over $1 billion, this represented virtually all the growth in our infrastructure business in Q3 this year-on-year. So without the benefit of generative AI revenue in Q3, our semiconductor business was approximately flat year-on-year. In fact, since the start of the fiscal year, our quarterly semiconductor revenue, excluding AI, has stabilized at around $6 billion. And as we had indicated to you a year ago, we expected a soft landing during fiscal '23, and it appears this is exactly what is happening today. Now let me give you more color on our end markets. As we go through this soft landing, we see though that our broad portfolio of products influencing the puts and takes across revenues within all our end markets except one, and that is networking. And so, in my remarks today, I focus on networking, where generative AI has a significant impact. Q3 networking revenue was $2.8 billion and was up 20% year-on-year in line with guidance, representing 40% of our semiconductor revenue. As we indicated above, our switches and routers, as well as our custom silicon AI engines, drove growth in this end market as they would deploy in scaling out AI clusters among the hyperscale. We've always believed and more than ever now with AI networks that Ethernet is the best networking protocol to scale out AI clusters. Ethernet today already offers the low latency attributes for machine learning and AI, and Broadcom has the best technology today and tomorrow. As a founding member of the Ultra Ethernet Consortium with other industry partners, we are driving Ethernet for scaling deployments in large language model networks. Importantly, we're doing this based on open standards and a broad ecosystem. Over the past quarter, we have already received substantial orders for our next-generation Tomahawk 5 switch and Jericho3-AI routers and plan to begin shipping these products over the next six months to several hyperscale customers. This will replace the existing 400-gigabit networks with 800-gigabit connectivity. And beyond this, for the next-generation 1.6-terabit connectivity, we have already started development on the Tomahawk 6 switch, which has, among other things, 200G SerDes generating throughput capacity of over 100 terabits per second. We are obviously excited that generative AI is pushing our engineers to develop cutting-edge technology in silicon technology that has never been developed before. We know the end of Moore's Law has set limits on computing in silicon technology, but what we are developing today feels very much like a revival. We invest in fundamental technologies to enable our hyperscale customers with the best hardware capabilities to scale generative AI. We invest in industry-leading 200G SerDes that can drive optics and even copper cables. We have differentiating technology that breaks current bottlenecks in high-bandwidth memory access. We also have high-speed and ultra-low power chip-to-chip connectivity to integrate multiple AI compute engines. We have also invested heavily in complex packaging technologies, migrating from today's 2.5D to 3D, which enables large memory to be integrated with the AI compute engines and accelerators. In sum, we have developed an end-to-end platform of plug-and-play silicon IP that enables hyperscalers to develop and deploy their AI clusters in an extremely accelerated time-to-market. Not surprisingly, in Q4, moving on to Q4, continuing to be driven by generative AI deployments, we expect our networking revenue to accelerate in excess of 20% year-on-year. This has been driven by the strength obviously in generative AI where we forecast to grow about 50% sequentially and almost two times year-on-year. Moving to wireless, Q3 wireless revenue of $1.6 billion represented 24% of semiconductor revenue, up 4% sequentially, flat year-on-year. The engagement with our North American customer continues to be deep and multi-year across WiFi, Bluetooth, Touch, RF Front-End, and Inductive Power. So in Q4, consistent with the seasonal launch, we expect wireless revenue to grow over 20% sequentially and down low-single-digit percent year-on-year. On our server storage connectivity revenue, it was $1.1 billion or 17% of semiconductor revenue and flat year-on-year. With a difficult year-on-year compare, we expect server storage connectivity revenue in Q4 to be down mid-teens percent year-on-year. And moving on to broadband, following nine consecutive quarters of double-digit growth, revenue moderated to 1% year-on-year growth to $1.1 billion or 16% of semiconductor revenue. In Q4, despite increasing penetration of deployment of 10G-PON among telcos, we expect broadband revenue to decline high-single digits year-on-year. Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $236 million declined 3% year-on-year, reflecting weak demand in China. And in Q4, though we expect an improvement with industrial resales up low-single-digit percentage year-on-year reflecting largely seasonality. So, in summary, Q3 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 5% year-on-year. And in Q4, we expect semiconductor revenue growth of low-to-mid single-digit percentage year-on-year. Sequentially, if we exclude generative AI, our semiconductor revenue will be flat. Now turning to software. In Q3, infrastructure software revenue of $1.9 billion grew 5% year-on-year and represented 22% of total revenue. For core software, consolidated renewal rates averaged 117% over expiring contracts, and in our strategic accounts, we averaged 127%. Within strategic accounts, annualized bookings of $408 million included $129 million or 32% of cross-selling of other portfolio products to these same core customers and over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. Over the last 12 months, I should add, consolidated renewal rates averaged 115% over expiring contracts, and in our strategic accounts, we averaged 125%. Because of this, our ARR, the indicator of forward revenue, at the end of Q3 was $5.3 billion. In Q4, we expect infrastructure software segment revenue to be up mid-single digit year-on-year. And on a consolidated basis for the company, we are guiding Q4 revenue of $9.27 billion, up 4% year-on-year. Before Kirsten tells you more about our financial performance for the quarter, let me provide a brief update on our pending acquisition of VMware. We have received legal merger clearance in Australia, Brazil, Canada, the European Union, Israel, South Africa, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom and foreign investment control clearance in all necessary jurisdictions. In the US, the Hart-Scott-Rodino pre-merger waiting periods have expired, and there is no legal impediment to closing under US merger regulations. We continue to work constructively with regulators in a few other jurisdictions and are in the advanced stages of the process towards obtaining the remaining required regulatory approvals, which we believe will be received before October 30th. We continue to expect to close on October 30th, 2023. Now Broadcom is confident that the combination with VMware will enhance competition in the cloud and benefit enterprise customers by giving them more choice and control over where they locate their workloads.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $8.9 billion for the quarter, up 5% from a year ago. Gross margins were 75.1% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.1 billion, down 8% year-on-year. R&D of $913 million was also down 8% year-on-year on lower variable spending. Operating income for the quarter was $5.5 billion and was up 6% from a year ago. Operating margin was 62% of revenue, up approximately 100 basis points year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA was $5.8 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $122 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $6.9 billion and represented 78% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 160 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were $792 million in Q3, down 7% year-on-year. R&D was $707 million in the quarter, down 8% year-on-year. Q3 semiconductor operating margins were 59%. Moving to the P&L for our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for the infrastructure software segment was $1.9 billion, up year-on-year and represented 22% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 92% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $337 million in the quarter, down 10% year-on-year. Infrastructure software operating margin was 75% in Q3 and operating profit grew 13% year-on-year. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.6 billion and represented 52% of revenues in Q3. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 30 days in the third quarter compared to 32 days in the second quarter. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 2% sequentially. We continue to remain very disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We exited the quarter with 80 days of inventory on hand, down from 86 days in Q2. We ended the third quarter with $12.1 billion of cash and $39.3 billion of gross debt, of which $1.1 billion is short term. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our fixed-rate debt is 3.61% and 9.7 years, respectively. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $1.9 billion in cash dividends. Consistent with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, we repurchased $1.7 billion of our common stock and eliminated 460 million of our common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 2.9 million AVGO shares. The non-GAAP diluted share count in Q3 was $436 million. As of the end of Q3, $7.3 billion was remaining under the share repurchase authorization. We suspended our repurchase program in early August in accordance with SEC rules, which do not allow stock buybacks during the period in which VMware shareholders are electing between cash and stock consideration in our pending transaction to acquire VMware. We expect the election period to end shortly before the anticipated closing of the transaction on October 30th, 2023. Excluding the impact of any share repurchases executed prior to the suspension, in Q4, we expect a non-GAAP diluted share count to be $435 million. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 is for consolidated revenues of $9.27 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 65% of projected revenue. In Q4, we expect gross margins to be down 80 basis points sequentially on product mix. We note that our guidance for Q4 does not include any contribution from VMware.

On the clarification, Hock, can you talk about the supply environment, if that's a constraining factor for your AI business? And if so, what kind of growth from a capacity perspective do you expect into fiscal '24? And then my question is more on the non-AI side. As you guys talked about, you've done really well in managing your own inventory. But when you look across inventory levels for your customers or at your customers, it seems as though they're sitting on quite a bit of inventory. So what's your confidence level as it pertains to a potential inventory correction in your non-AI business, networking business going forward? Thank you.",

These are advanced silicon products that involve the entire stack from the chip to packaging and even the HBM memory used in those chips. Consequently, there are significant constraints as we try to meet demand within these lead times. As demand comes in faster than our production capacity allows, it creates ongoing challenges. On your second point, we see what I would call a soft landing, with approximately $6 billion of non-AI related revenue per quarter fluctuating on a plateau. While growth has slowed considerably, it remains stable. Our portfolio is diverse, with multiple products in various end markets, each with its own timing based on customer needs. This leads to variations in performance across products, but overall it averages around $6 billion each quarter, which we are currently observing.",

          "content": "It\u2019s Hock. Let me address your question as it requires a more comprehensive response. The main factor affecting our gross margin isn't significantly tied to transactional supply chain issues. While there may be fluctuations at times, they aren't substantial or sustained enough to impact trends. Instead, what drives our gross margin primarily is our product mix. We have a diverse range of products that we categorize and communicate differently across various end markets. Each product has varying gross margins depending on its application, importance, and other factors. Thus, we have quite a variety. The key factor influencing gross margin trends is the adoption rate of next-generation products in each category. As new generations of products are adopted, we have the chance to increase our gross margin. The rate of adoption is crucial because for some products, changes in gross margin occur every few years, while others have a longer cycle. As a result, we experience different growth profiles for gross margins. When we look back at 2021 and 2022, amid a semiconductor industry upcycle marked by lockdowns, behavioral shifts, and high demand, there was a significant acceleration in product adoption. This rapid adoption contributed to not only revenue but also gross margin expansion since a larger share of our products transitioned to next-generation versions faster. Currently, we are seeing a potential slowdown in adoption rates, which may slow down gross margin expansion, but this will balance out over time. Historically, our model, supported by fundamental economic principles, shows that with our extensive product line and varying product life cycles, we've experienced long-term gross margin expansion ranging from 50 to 150 basis points annually for semiconductors. In some years, like 2022, this has exceeded 200 basis points. Consequently, there are years where gross margin expansion is less, around 50 basis points. Overall, this process will be ongoing.",

We are witnessing an increase in the adoption of large language models, primarily influenced by hyperscale environments. Ethernet is gaining significant traction and is already being deployed in many hyperscales. It works well alongside InfiniBand, with the effectiveness dependent on the specific workloads and applications involved.

Developing the hardware infrastructure to support large language models for hyperscalers is quite challenging. Even with any engagements, those do not easily convert into revenue. To summarize, we are currently shipping custom AI engines to one hyperscale customer, and I prefer to leave it at that. Regarding customized switching and routing, that certainly exists. Some OEMs have been providing switch or router systems with their proprietary solutions and operating systems for the past 20 to 30 years. Currently, around 70% of the market relies on merchant silicon. While this may not apply to the network operating systems, it definitely pertains to the silicon.

I\u2019ve been anticipating a reset in storage and broadband for some time, and it seems like Q4 might be a bit softer for you. Perhaps you're referring to that reset as a soft landing, Hock. Could you elaborate on what you mean by a soft landing? Does that suggest we have indeed reached a turning point? Do you expect those businesses to be bottoming out at this point?

While we strive to get this right, it's not always perfect, but we are improving in our approach. The data you\u2019re seeing, especially regarding broadband and service storage, might appear somewhat flat, and that\u2019s why I emphasized considering the broader picture without factoring in generative AI. My product portfolio is diverse and serves different markets. During times like these, which I refer to as a plateau, we experience a soft landing. In this scenario, we don\u2019t experience complete stagnation; instead, some products may be affected by shipment timing, leading to fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter. What we're noticing now in Q3 and even Q4 relates to the logistics of customer shipments across various products. My comments regarding revenue refer to the ups and downs around a median, which currently stands at approximately $6 billion and has remained stable since the beginning of fiscal '23. As we approach Q4, it's still around that mark. While some segments may rise and others may fall, this fluctuation contributes to the overall picture. I hope this clarifies your inquiry regarding whether this is a trend or just a temporary situation.

For instance, our next-generation Tomahawk5 switch, set to begin shipping in the middle of next year, is part of a program we call Bailly. This is a fully integrated silicon photonic switch that operates at very low power. By consolidating optical and mechanical features into an integrated silicon photonic solution, we can eliminate the reliability issues associated with traditional methods, effectively translating to improved silicon yield rates. This approach is believed to be more reliable than conventional techniques.  So, why haven't more companies adopted it? The truth is, we are pioneering this silicon photonic architecture. We've conducted proof of concept with our Tomahawk 4 in a couple of hyperscale environments, though not yet in production volume. We have now gathered sufficient reliability data from those cases, allowing us to move forward with the production launch of Tomahawk5. As they say, the proof will be in the results. We expect that if we can demonstrate its power efficiency in one or two hyperscalers, it will start to gain traction among others. Power efficiency is crucial, especially in data centers, and we're looking at a potential 30% to 40% reduction in power usage.

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q4 2023, consolidated net revenue was $9.3 billion, up 4% year-on-year and very much as we had guided at the last conference call. Semiconductor solutions revenue increased 3% year-on-year to $7.3 billion, and infrastructure software revenue grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Overall, while infrastructure software remains very stable, semiconductor is continuing the cyclical slowdown at enterprises and telcos that we have been seeing over the past six months. However, hyperscalers remain strong. Generative AI revenue, driven by Ethernet solutions and custom AI accelerators, represented close to $1.5 billion in Q4 or 20% of semiconductor revenue, while the rest of the semiconductor revenue continued to be rather stable at around $6 billion. Moving on to results for the year. For fiscal 2023, consolidated revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. And since 2020, even though we have not made an acquisition, we have shown a robust trajectory of growth, driven by semiconductor growing at an 18% CAGR over the past three years. In fiscal 2023, operating profit grew by 9% year-on-year, and our free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of revenue. We returned $13.5 billion in cash to our shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks. As you well know, we just closed the acquisition of VMware on November 22, just about four weeks into Broadcom\u2019s fiscal 2024. We are now refocusing VMware on its core business of creating private and hybrid cloud environments among large enterprises globally and divesting noncore assets. Reflecting the consolidation of a restructured VMware into our 2024 outlook, we forecast our fiscal year \u201824 consolidated revenue to be $50 billion. We expect the integration to take about a year and will require close to $1 billion in transition spending, which will largely be done as we exit fiscal \u201824. Regardless, we expect our fiscal year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to be approximately 60% of revenue. Kirsten will give you more details in her section. Now, let me give you more color on our two reporting segments, and I\u2019ll start with software. In Q4, as you know, there\u2019s no VMware revenue and the infrastructure software business of CA, Symantec and Brocade grew 7% year-on-year to $2 billion. Consolidated renewal rates averaged 119% over expiring contracts. And in our strategic accounts, we actually averaged 130%. Over 90% of the renewal value represented recurring subscription and maintenance. For the year, renewal rates averaged 116% over expiring contracts and in strategic accounts, we averaged 124%. Revenue in fiscal 2023 was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year and our expectation for fiscal \u201824 is for this revenue to be $8 billion, which is 4% year-on-year. For the 2024 outlook, we are excited to now include VMware. As we all know, VMware has the leading technology to virtualize entire data centers, not just compute, and by doing so, create private cloud on-prem. Our strategy going forward is simply to enable global enterprises to run their applications across the other data centers as well as on public clouds by consuming VMware\u2019s higher-value software stack. And to attract and keep these workloads across the environment, we are investing in a rich catalog of microservices tools. This will be our focus. And the noncore businesses of end-user computing and Carbon Black will be divested. So for 2024, based on 11 months of contribution from VMware, we expect VMware to contribute $12 billion in revenue. And on a consolidated basis, we expect our infrastructure software revenue in 2024 to be $20 billion. Turning now to the semiconductor segment. Let me give you more color by end markets. Q4 networking revenue of $3.1 billion grew 23% year-on-year, representing 42% of our semiconductor revenue. This was primarily driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for our custom AI accelerators and for our networking switches, routers and NICs, Network Interface Cards, dedicated towards scaling our AI data centers. As you know, even as Ethernet is the standard protocol in front-end networks, hyperscalers are also deploying Ethernet predominantly in their AI networks. In fiscal \u201823, networking revenue grew 21% year-on-year to $10.8 billion. If we exclude the AI accelerators, networking connectivity represented about $8 billion, and this is purely silicon, not systems, not cable nor subsystems. In fiscal 2024, we expect networking revenue to grow 30% year-on-year, driven by accelerating deployment of networking connectivity and expansion of AI accelerators in hyperscalers. Moving to wireless. Consistent with the seasonal launch by our North American customers, Q4 wireless revenue of $2 billion increased 23% sequentially and declined 3% year-on-year, representing 27% of semiconductor revenue. In fiscal \u201823, wireless revenue was relatively flat at $7.3 billion, just down 2% year-on-year. The engagement with our North American customers continues to be deep, strategic and multiyear. And accordingly, in fiscal \u201824, we expect wireless revenue to again remain stable year-on-year. Next, our Q4 server storage connectivity revenue was $1 billion or 14% of semiconductor revenue and down 17% year-on-year. In fiscal \u201823, server storage connectivity was $4.5 billion, up 11% year-on-year. And going to fiscal \u201824, we expect server storage revenue to decline mid- to high-teens percentage year-on-year, driven by the cyclical weakness that began late \u201823. And moving on to broadband. Q4 revenue declined 9% year-on-year to $950 million, in line with expectations and represented 13% of semiconductor revenue. And in fiscal \u201823, broadband revenue was $4.5 billion and up 8% year-on-year. Moving on to fiscal \u201824, we expect broadband revenue to be down low- to mid-teens percentage year-on-year and reflecting, again, the further slowdown as the cyclical weakness at service providers that began in late \u201823 continues into fiscal \u201824. And finally, Q4 industrial sales of $236 million was stable year-on-year. In fiscal \u201823, industrial resales were $962 million. In fiscal \u201824, we expect industrial resales to be down low single digits year-on-year. So in summary, fiscal \u201823 semiconductor solutions revenue was up 9% year-on-year to $28.2 billion. Revenue from generative AI in fiscal \u201823 reached 15% of semiconductor revenue, in line with our expectation. And moving on to fiscal \u201824, we forecast semiconductor solutions revenue to be up mid- to high-single-digit percent year-on-year. We expect revenue from generative AI to represent more than 25% of the semiconductor revenue, consistent with prior guidance, which more than offsets the lack of growth from non-AI semiconductor revenue. With the consolidation of VMware, bringing our Infrastructure Software segment revenue to $20 billion and the semiconductor segment holding at mid-high single-digit growth year-on-year, we are therefore guiding our fiscal \u201824 revenue to be $50 billion, which represents 40% year-on-year growth from fiscal \u201823. With that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $9.3 billion for the quarter, up 4% from a year ago. Gross margins were 74.3% of revenue in the quarter, in line with our expectations. Operating expenses were $1.2 billion, flat year-on-year. R&D of $940 million was also stable year-on-year. Operating income for the quarter was $5.7 billion and was up 4% from a year ago, with operating margin at 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $6 billion or 65% of revenue, in line with expectations. This figure excludes $124 million of depreciation. Now, a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with our semiconductor segment. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.3 billion and represented 79% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 3% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 70%, down 110 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses were stable year-on-year at $822 million, resulting in operating profit growth of 2% year-on-year and semiconductor operating margins of 58%. Now, moving on to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $2 billion, up 7% year-on-year and represented 21% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 92% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $339 million in the quarter. Q4 operating profit grew 12% year-on-year with infrastructure software operating margin at 75%. Now moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 51% of revenues in Q4. We spent $105 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 31 days in the fourth quarter compared to 30 days in the third. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We exited the quarter with 76 days of inventory on hand, down from 80 days in Q3. We ended the fourth quarter with $14.2 billion of cash and $39.2 billion of gross debt, of which $1.6 billion is short term. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal 2023. Our revenue hit a record $35.8 billion, growing 8% year-on-year. Semiconductor revenue was $28.2 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $7.6 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Gross margin for the year was 74.7%, down 90 basis points from a year ago. Operating expenses were $4.6 billion, down 4% year-on-year. Fiscal 2023 operating income was $22.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year and represented 62% of net revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $23.2 billion, up 10% year-over-year and represented 65% of net revenue. This figure excludes $502 million of depreciation. We spent $452 million on capital expenditures, and free cash flow grew 8% year-on-year to $17.6 billion or 49% of fiscal 2023 revenue. Now, turning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2023, we spent $15.3 billion, consisting of $7.6 billion in cash dividends and $7.7 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. We ended the year with $7.2 billion of authorized share repurchase programs remaining. With the VMware deal closed, we have resumed repurchasing shares under our existing program. In fiscal year 2024, including the incremental shares from the acquisition of VMware and excluding the potential impact of any share repurchases, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 494 million. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year and now off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2024 to $5.25 per share, an increase of 14% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal \u201824 subject to quarterly Board approval. This implies our fiscal 2024 annual common stock dividend to be a record $21 per share. I would like to highlight that this represents the 13th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now on to guidance. As Hock discussed, with the recent closing of our VMware acquisition and the integration process, which will take at least one year, for fiscal 2024, we will provide our outlook for the full year instead of quarterly guidance. Based on current business trends and conditions, our guidance for fiscal year 2024 is for consolidated revenues of $50 billion. Within this, our fiscal year 2024 semiconductor revenue is expected to grow mid- to high-single-digit percent year-on-year. Our fiscal year 2024 infrastructure software segment revenue from continuing operations is expected to be $20 billion, including $8 billion from CA, Symantec Enterprise and Brocade and $12 billion from VMware. With regard to VMware, our forecast for fiscal \u201824 revenue of $12 billion reflects 11 months of contribution from VMware. This does not include revenue from EUC and Carbon Black of approximately $2 billion, which we plan to divest. We are also converting an installed base of licenses that is over 60% perpetual today to one that will be mostly subscription by the end of fiscal 2024. Offsetting these, our new strategy for VMware will accelerate revenue growth over the next three years. During fiscal \u201824, we expect to incur about $1 billion of spend related to transitioning VMware into the new Broadcom model. This transition spending will be largely completed by the end of the fiscal year as our VMware spending run rate exits fiscal \u201824 at approximately $1.4 billion per quarter, down 40% from a year ago. So, in fiscal year 2024, including VMware, we expect consolidated adjusted EBITDA of approximately 60% of projected revenue. That concludes my prepared remarks.

It's also clear that it's very dynamic as the architectures of large language models and software models continue to evolve rapidly. We are observing changes in the requirements for compute silicon, which is both interesting and fascinating for us. This presents a significant opportunity. If a customer has a substantial business model and the resources to support it, it may make sense for them to design AI compute engines that incorporate both memory and the compute engine itself, customized for their specific application needs and LLM model. We are witnessing continuous changes in LLM models and the evolution of generative AI, where training and inference are beginning to converge and chip designs are adapting accordingly. This is evident in how we develop specific custom chips for hyperscalers, which is a compelling opportunity for us. As I mentioned earlier, we project that our networking revenue, which includes AI networks, will reach $4 billion and nearly double throughout 2024. We have communicated this before, and we are reinforcing that guidance. Networking is particularly noteworthy as it is growing in line with our AI accelerators and compute engines. We see this growth continuing, especially with the continuous training of very large language models with diverse and extensive parameters. There is no slowdown in the expansion of AI networks; in fact, we are observing an average doubling in the size of those networks across the board.

While subscription models typically lead to a decrease in revenues due to revenue recognition practices, we anticipate a trajectory of accelerated growth through 2024. This growth is supported by the mathematics of our strategy, and to address your question, we are indeed accelerating from a $12 billion base and expect to see double-digit growth over the next three years, driven by the sale of this higher value virtualization stack compared to the less focused sales approach we had previously, especially in compute-only sales.",

But given the significant performance requirements of these workloads, right, training, inference, it appears that more of the near-term adoption of running these workloads is on bare metal, GPU, TPU, accelerated servers.

This means it can effectively virtualize the NVIDIA GPU alongside the VMware software stack. This creates a compelling incentive for many enterprises to consider adopting the entire VCF setup.

Now, if you ask me, maybe server storage, that could be a little excessive, but not broadband and certainly not in networking. So overall, on our products, we still feel rather good about it. And the best indication is the level of our own inventory on our own books. But what we do see is customers are perhaps much more cautious about buying more stuff, not just because they have too much of my inventory, I think because they have too much of everybody else\u2019s inventory out there.

We prioritize supporting these customers and provide them with excellent support along with growing feature requests in the area. We also focus on Symantec, which serves a small group of core customers. A significant aspect of CA's technology, especially in mainframe, is that it handles many legacy applications that remain very relevant today. Customers prefer to operate these applications using mainframe tools because modernizing or changing them does not make sense for their specific reasons. On the other hand, VMware offers a product that is both contemporary and forward-looking. It allows the creation of a virtualized cloud environment within a company\u2019s own data center, making it suitable for any global business. Transitioning to a public cloud is fully virtualized and highly resilient when utilizing a software-defined environment. With VMware, we are providing a similar virtualization experience for on-premises data centers tailored for companies that already have workloads running on VMware products, specifically those built on VMware Cloud Foundation. This approach gives enterprises the chance to implement a hyperscaler within their own premises. That\u2019s our straightforward plan.",

It has also afforded me the chance to connect personally with at least 150 CIOs globally from VMware's largest customers over the last 12 to 16 months. One clear takeaway is that the VMware core product, particularly the VMware Cloud Foundation software stack, which facilitates the virtualization of not just computing but also storage, networking, and the orchestration and management layer across the entire stack, is highly sought after by CIOs and heads of infrastructure at many large companies. They want the capability to deploy solutions that manage their diverse data centers, which currently feature a mix of virtualization, compute, and various hardware vendors, under a single abstraction layer. This approach not only reduces hardware expenses but also leads to significant cost savings in management. This illustrates the value of the technology VMware offers.

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. In our fiscal Q1 2024, consolidated net revenue was $12 billion, an increase of 34% year-on-year, including 10.5 weeks of contribution from VMware. Excluding VMware, consolidated revenue rose 11% year-on-year. Semiconductor solutions revenue grew 4% year-on-year to $7.4 billion, while infrastructure software revenue increased by 153% year-on-year to $4.6 billion. The contribution from consolidating VMware caused a sequential revenue hike of 132% in infrastructure software. We anticipate that the strong bookings at VMware will continue to drive revenue growth for the remainder of fiscal 2024. In semiconductors, AI revenue rose fourfold year-on-year to $2.3 billion in the quarter, outweighing the ongoing cyclical slowdown in enterprise and telecommunications sectors. Let me elaborate further on our two reporting segments, starting with software. In Q1, software segment revenue reached $4.6 billion, up 156% year-on-year, which included $2.1 billion from VMware. Consolidated bookings in software increased sequentially from under $600 million to $1.8 billion in Q1, and we expect this to exceed $3 billion in Q2. Revenue from VMware is projected to grow by double digits sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, for the rest of the fiscal year, which is a direct result of our strategy with VMware. We are focusing on upselling customers, particularly those already using vSphere virtualization tools, to upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation, also known as VCF. VCF is the comprehensive software stack that integrates compute, storage, and networking, effectively virtualizing and modernizing customers' data centers. This on-premises self-service cloud platform offers customers a supplement and alternative to public cloud solutions. In fact, last August, at VM Explore, VMware and NVIDIA announced a partnership called VMware Private AI Foundation, allowing VCF to operate GPUs. This enables customers to deploy their AI models on-premises and wherever they operate, maintaining control over their data and privacy. We are observing a robust demand for VCF, especially from enterprises aiming to manage their expanding AI workloads on-premises. Considering all these factors, we reaffirm our fiscal 2024 software revenue guidance of $20 billion.  Now, turning to semiconductors. Before I provide an overall assessment of this segment, let me break it down by end markets. In Q1, networking revenue was $3.3 billion, up 46% year-on-year, accounting for 45% of our semiconductor revenue. This growth was largely driven by strong demand for our custom AI accelerators from two major hyperscale customers. This demand extends beyond AI accelerators. Our latest generation Tomahawk 5 800G switches are experiencing strong demand due to innovations in Ethernet mix, DSPs, and optical components, especially from hyperscale customers and large enterprises deploying AI data centers. For fiscal 2024, recognizing the ongoing demand strengths in AI NAND, we now expect networking revenue to grow over 35% year-on-year, revising our previous guidance of 30% growth.  Next, in wireless, Q1 revenue was $2 billion, which marked a 1% sequential decline and a 4% year-on-year decrease, representing 27% of semiconductor revenue. Our engagement with a North American customer continues to deepen, being very strategic and long-term. For fiscal 2024, with anticipated content increases, we maintain our previous guidance that wireless revenue will remain flat year-on-year.  Regarding server storage connectivity, Q1 revenue was $887 million, or 12% of semiconductor revenue, reflecting a 29% year-on-year decline. While we are witnessing weaker demand in the first half, we anticipate a recovery in the second half. Therefore, we are adjusting our forecast for fiscal '24 server storage revenue to predict a mid-20 percentage decline year-on-year, down from our prior guidance of a high teens decline.  On broadband, Q1 revenue fell 23% year-on-year to $940 million, constituting 13% of semiconductor revenue. We are currently experiencing a cyclical low for broadband, as telco spending continues to weaken, and we do not foresee an improvement until later in the year. Consequently, we are revising our fiscal '24 broadband revenue outlook to be down 30% year-on-year, compared to our previous guidance of a mid-teens decline. Lastly, Q1 industrial resales amounted to $215 million, reflecting a 6% year-on-year decline. For fiscal '24, we project industrial resales to decline by high single digits year-on-year.  In summary, stronger-than-expected growth from AI has outweighed the cyclical weaknesses in broadband and server storage, resulting in Q1 semiconductor revenue growing 4% year-on-year to $7.4 billion. For fiscal '24, we reaffirm our guidance for Semiconductor Solutions revenue to rise by mid- to high single digits year-on-year. Although we stated in December that AI would constitute 25% of our total semiconductor revenue for the year, we now anticipate that AI revenue will be significantly higher, representing about 35% of semiconductor revenue at over $10 billion. This growth compensates for the weaker-than-expected demand in broadband and server storage. Hence, for fiscal 2024, we reiterate our consolidated revenue guidance of $50 billion, reflecting a 40% year-on-year increase. We also reaffirm our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance of 60%. Before handing the call over to Kirsten for more insights into our financial performance this quarter, I want to mention that Broadcom has published its fourth annual ESG report, accessible on our corporate citizenship site, which showcases our sustainability efforts. As a global technology leader, we recognize our responsibility to connect our customers, employees, and communities through our product and technology innovations, as well as operational excellence. We remain committed to this mission.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q1 financial performance, which was a 14-week quarter and included 10.5 weeks of contribution from VMware. Consolidated revenue was $12 billion for the quarter, up 34% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q1 revenue increased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 75.4% of revenue in the quarter. Operating expenses were $2.2 billion and R&D was $1.4 billion, both up year-on-year primarily due to the contribution from VMware. Q1 operating income, including VMware, was $6.8 billion, and was up 26% from a year ago, with an operating margin at 57% of revenue. Excluding transition costs of $226 million in Q1, operating profit of $7.1 billion was up 30% from a year ago, with an operating margin of 59% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.2 billion or 60% of revenue. This figure excludes $139 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with Semiconductor. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $7.4 billion and represented 62% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 4% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 190 basis points year-on-year driven primarily by product mix within our semiconductor end markets. Operating expenses increased 8% year-on-year to $865 million, reflecting a 14-week quarter resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%. Now moving on to our infrastructure software segment. Revenue for infrastructure software was $4.6 billion, up 153% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 38% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 88% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 59%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 64%. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.7 billion and represented 39% of revenues off a higher revenue base. Excluding restructuring and integration spend of $658 million, free cash flows were 45% of revenue. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 41 days in the first quarter compared to 31 days in the fourth quarter on higher accounts receivable due to the VMware acquisition. The accounts receivable we brought on from VMware has payment terms of 60 days, unlike Broadcom's standard 30 days. We ended the first quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 1% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the first quarter with $11.9 billion of cash and $75.9 billion of gross debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $48 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.5% and 8.4 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $30 billion in floating-rate debt is 6.6% and three years, respectively. During the quarter, we repaid $934 million of fixed-rate debt that came due. This week, we repaid $2 billion of our floating rate debt, and we intend to maintain this quarterly repayment of debt throughout fiscal 2024. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid shareholders $2.4 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $5.25 per share. We executed on our plan to complete our remaining share buyback authorization. We repurchased $7.2 billion of our common stock and eliminated $1.1 billion of common stock for taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the repurchase and elimination of approximately 7.7 million AVGO shares. To help you with modeling share count, the weighted effect of the 54 million shares issued for the VMware acquisition resulted in a sequential increase in Q1 to $478 million. With the Q2 non-GAAP diluted share count expected to increase to approximately $492 million as the shares issued are fully weighted in the second quarter. Now on to guidance. Regardless of the updated dynamics of our semiconductor and software segments, as Hock discussed, we choose to reiterate our guidance for fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue of $50 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 60%. With regard to VMware, in February, we signed a definitive agreement to divest the end-user computing division with the transaction expected to close in 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals. The EUC division has been classified as discontinued operations in our Q1 financials. We have decided to retain the Carbon Black business and merge Carbon Black with Symantec to form the enterprise security group. The impact on revenue and profitability is not significant.

And then, kind of part B of that is, on the switching side, have you already started to see benefits from the 51 terabit per second switches? Is that something that comes along later?

And you're going for bigger and bigger pipes. Hence, the Tomahawk 5 51 terabit is a perfect solution, and we're seeing a lot of demand. In many cases, we are basically, they are surpassing the rate of adoption that we had previously thought. It is a very good solution in connecting GPUs.

A lot of these customers have legacy but essential mainframes that remain critical despite being outdated. As they modernize their workloads, they have options, balancing applications in on-prem distributed data centers with deploying some workloads in the public cloud due to elastic demand. Currently, most customers find their on-prem data centers do not match the high availability, low latency, and resilience offered in the cloud, which is exactly what we're providing with VMware Cloud Foundation.

The first is hyperscalers, particularly the very large ones with extensive consumer subscriber bases. You can probably guess who these players are. They have a massive amount of data and their model focuses on retaining subscribers to enhance the user experience and create better advertising opportunities for their clients, resulting in a quick return on investment. This segment is characterized by a few large players who can scale up investment substantially. Here, custom silicon and AI accelerators are crucial, and that\u2019s where our focus lies. These companies also purchase AI accelerators in large quantities, often in clusters, due to the demands of running foundational and large language models, alongside significant networking components. However, the value of networking, while growing, is still a minor part in comparison to the value of the AI accelerators we offer. The second segment, which is smaller, consists of the enterprise AI segment. This includes companies of various sizes that are starting AI initiatives driven by recent trends and discussions surrounding AI's potential to enhance productivity. Instead of utilizing public cloud solutions, many are attempting to implement these initiatives on-premises. In doing so, they tend to utilize standard silicon for AI accelerators, which falls into the merchant silicon market, where we do not have a competitive presence. On the networking side, however, these enterprises do purchase our networking products such as switches and routers, including devices from companies like Arista. It creates an interesting blend of opportunities in both segments, and we are observing growth in each.",

As many of you know, traditional enterprise networking is currently experiencing a bit of a slowdown. It's important to understand that much of this demand is driven by AI. This can lead to a skewed perspective because the focus and content in networking related to compute differ significantly between an AI data center and a traditional CPU-based data center. I don\u2019t want to mislead you. In the AI data center, there is indeed a considerable amount of content related to DSPs, PAM4s, optical components, and PCI Express switches, but they still represent a minor share of our overall sales when compared to switches and routers. In relation to AI accelerators, they are even smaller. As I mentioned, our AI revenue is projected to exceed $10 billion this year with 70% coming from AI accelerators and 30% from everything else. Out of that, around 20% consists of switches and routers, with the remainder being various retirement DSP components because, as I stated, we are not fully vertically integrated and do not produce the complete optical transceiver. These are typically manufactured by OEM contract manufacturers, like Eoptolink in China, who are more competitive.

You need to invest in software models that are compatible with your custom silicon and align with your business model. This leads to the creation of foundational models that need to be optimized for the custom silicon being developed. It\u2019s an iterative process that constantly evolves, even for the same customers we work with. I mentioned this in the last call; it takes years to reach a point where you can confidently deliver production-ready solutions. This delay isn\u2019t due to poor silicon but rather the incompatibility with the foundation models the customer has and the software and firmware layers that support it. Everything needs to function correctly, creating an entire ecosystem, which we do well in x86 CPUs, but this is still early-stage for AI accelerators like GPUs. It takes time.

Currently, an AI accelerator, whether for merchants or customers, requires more than just numerous floating point multipliers for matrix multiplication and analysis. It also needs substantial memory, essentially high-speed cache memory. The chip isn't just a basic multiplier; it includes memory and has a three-dimensional architecture. Designing or building memory isn't something we excel at in AI accelerators, so we source high-bandwidth memory from specialized suppliers, which is common in the industry. When these components come together, that defines an AI accelerator. While I might achieve a favorable gross margin on the logic chip, it's impossible to apply the same margin to the high-bandwidth memory, which significantly contributes to the overall chip cost. This fundamental math indicates that the gross margin for the entire AI accelerator is lower compared to traditional silicon products. The addition of memory leads to this natural margin reduction, and no one can rationalize applying higher margins to memory. Consequently, the overall margin is inherently lower. However, regarding the logic aspect, with the high-density floating point multipliers we develop on advanced silicon, we can maintain margins comparable to our overall gross margin.",

          "content": "Thank you, Ji. And thank you everyone for joining today. In our fiscal Q2 2024 results, consolidated net revenue was $12.5 billion, up 43% year-on-year as revenue included a full quarter of contribution from VMware. But if we exclude VMware, consolidated revenue was up 12% year-on-year. This 12% organic growth in revenue was largely driven by AI revenue, which stepped up 280% year-on-year to $3.1 billion, more than offsetting continued cyclical weakness in semiconductor revenue from enterprises and telcos. Let me now give you more color on our two reporting segments. Beginning with software. In Q2, infrastructure software segment revenue of $5.3 billion was up 175% year-on-year and included $2.7 billion in revenue contribution from VMware, up from $2.1 billion in the prior quarter. The integration of VMware is going very well. Since we acquired VMware, we have modernized the product SKUs from over 8,000 disparate SKUs to four core product offerings and simplified the go-to-market flow, eliminating a huge amount of channel conflicts. We are making good progress in transitioning all VMware products to a subscription licensing model. And since closing the deal, we have actually signed up close to 3,000 of our largest 10,000 customers to enable them to build a self-service virtual private cloud on-prem. Each of these customers typically sign up to a multi-year contract, which we normalize into an annual measure known as Annualized Booking Value, or ABV. This metric, ABV for VMware products, accelerated from $1.2 billion in Q1 to $1.9 billion in Q2. By reference, for the consolidated Broadcom software portfolio, ABV grew from $1.9 billion in Q1 to $2.8 billion over the same period in Q2. Meanwhile, we have integrated SG&A across the entire platform and eliminated redundant functions. Year-to-date, we have incurred about $2 billion of restructuring and integration costs and drove our spending run rate at VMware to $1.6 billion this quarter, from what used to be $2.3 billion per quarter pre-acquisition. We expect spending will continue to decline towards a $1.3 billion run rate exiting Q4, better than our previous $1.4 billion plan, and will likely stabilize at $1.2 billion post-integration. VMware revenue in Q1 was $2.1 billion, grew to $2.7 billion in Q2, and will accelerate towards a $4 billion per quarter run rate. We therefore expect operating margins for VMware to begin to converge towards that of classic Broadcom software by fiscal 2025. Turning to semiconductors, let me give you more color by end markets. Networking. Q2 revenue of $3.8 billion grew 44% year-on-year, representing 53% of semiconductor revenue. This was again driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and custom accelerators. It's interesting to note that as AI data center clusters continue to deploy, our revenue mix has been shifting towards an increasing proportion of networking. We doubled the number of switches we sold year-on-year, particularly the PAM-5 and Jericho3, which we deployed successfully in close collaboration with partners like Arista Networks, Dell, Juniper, and Supermicro. Additionally, we also doubled our shipments of PCI Express switches and NICs in the AI backend fabric. We're leading the rapid transition of optical interconnects in AI data centers to 800 gigabit bandwidth, which is driving accelerated growth for our DSPs, optical lasers, and PIN diodes. And we are not standing still. Together with these same partners, we are developing the next generation switches, DSP, and optics that will drive the ecosystem towards 1.6 terabit connectivity to scale out larger AI accelerated clusters. Next year, we expect all mega-scale GPU deployments to be on Ethernet. We expect the strength in AI to continue, and because of that, we now expect networking revenue to grow 40% year-on-year compared to our prior guidance of over 35% growth. Moving to wireless. Q2 wireless revenue of $1.6 billion grew 2% year-on-year, was seasonally down 19% quarter-on-quarter and represents 22% of semiconductor revenue. And in fiscal '24, helped by content increases, we reiterate our previous guidance for wireless revenue to be essentially flat year-on-year. This trend is wholly consistent with our continued engagement with our North American customer, which is deep, strategic, and multiyear and represents all of our wireless business. Next, our Q2 server storage connectivity revenue was $824 million or 11% of semiconductor revenue, down 27% year-on-year. We believe though, Q2 was the bottom in server storage. Based on updated demand forecast and bookings, we expect a modest recovery in the second half of the year. And accordingly, we forecast fiscal '24 server storage revenue to decline around the 20% range year-on-year. Moving on to broadband. Q2 revenue declined 39% year-on-year to $730 million and represented 10% of semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on the continued pause in telco and service provider spending. We expect Broadcom to bottom in the second half of the year with a recovery in 2025. Accordingly, we are revising our outlook for fiscal '24 broadband revenue to be down high 30s year-on-year from our prior guidance for a decline of just over 30% year-on-year. Finally, Q2 industrial revenue of $234 million declined 10% year-on-year. And for fiscal '24, we now expect industrial revenue to be down double-digit percentage year-on-year compared to our prior guidance for high single-digit decline. So to sum it all up, here's what we are seeing. For fiscal '24, we expect revenue from AI to be much stronger at over $11 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue has bottomed in Q2 and is likely to recover modestly for the second half of fiscal '24. On infrastructure software, we're making very strong progress in integrating VMware and accelerating its growth. Pulling all these three key factors together, we are raising our fiscal '24 revenue guidance to $51 billion.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q2 financial performance, which included a full quarter of contribution from VMware. Consolidated revenue was $12.5 billion for the quarter, up 43% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q2 revenue increased 12% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.2% of revenue in the quarter. Operating expenses were $2.4 billion and R&D was $1.5 billion, both up year-on-year primarily due to the consolidation of VMware. Q2 operating income was $7.1 billion and was up 32% from a year ago with operating margin at 57% of revenue. Excluding transition costs, operating profit of $7.4 billion was up 36% from a year ago, with operating margin of 59% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $7.4 billion or 60% of revenue. This figure excludes $149 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.2 billion and represented 58% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 6% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 370 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of custom AI accelerators. Operating expenses increased 4% year-on-year to $868 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 55%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.3 billion, up 170% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 42% of revenue. Gross margin for infrastructure software was 88% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.5 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 60%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 64%. Now moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.4 billion and represented 36% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $830 million, free cash flows of $5.3 billion were up 18% year-on-year and represented 42% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from 2023 due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of US income and the delay in the reenactment of Section 174. We spent $132 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 40 days in the second quarter, consistent with 41 days in the first quarter. We ended the second quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 4% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across our ecosystem. We ended the second quarter with $9.8 billion of cash and $74 billion of gross debt. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $48 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.5% and 8.2 years respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $28 billion in floating rate debt is 6.6% and 2.8 years, respectively. During the quarter, we repaid $2 billion of our floating rate debt, and we intend to maintain this quarterly repayment of debt throughout fiscal 2024. Turning to capital allocation. In the quarter, we paid stockholders $2.4 billion of cash dividends based on a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $5.25 per share. In Q2, non-GAAP diluted share count was 492 million as the 54 million shares issued for the VMware acquisition were fully weighted in the second quarter. We paid $1.5 billion withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of 1.2 million AVGO shares. Today, we are announcing a 10-for-1 forward stock split of Broadcom's common stock to make ownership of Broadcom stock more accessible to investors and to employees. Our stockholders of record after the close of market on July 11, 2024, will receive an additional nine shares of common stock after the close of market on July 12, with trading on a split-adjusted basis expected to commence at market open on July 15, 2024. In Q3, reflecting a post-split basis, we expect share count to be approximately 4.92 billion shares. Now on to guidance. We are raising our guidance for fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue to $51 billion and adjusted EBITDA to 61%. For modeling purposes, please keep in mind that GAAP net income and cash flows in fiscal year 2024 are impacted by restructuring and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

So I'm curious how you think customers are going to do that allocation decision, just broadly what the visibility is.

          "content": "That's an interesting question, Vivek. Regarding AI accelerators, we are following a different model. The GPUs, which are the preferred AI accelerators in the market, are extremely effective and are an area where NVIDIA excels. We don\u2019t see ourselves as competitors to them in this space, as they have their strengths and we know our position in relation to that. However, for selected hyperscalers, if there's scale and the ability to create silicon solutions, we are open to using our intellectual property to develop custom ASIC AI accelerators tailored for specific complex AI workloads. I do not view these as direct competitors. I am not positioning myself to compete with them in the GPU market. We are not competitors there, nor do we aim to be. In terms of networking, the situation may differ, as people may approach it from various perspectives. We have a long history with Ethernet, having been involved for over 25 years, and we have navigated many market transitions, successfully adapting from cloud-scale networking to routing and now AI, making our entry into AI a natural progression. We acknowledge that the ecosystem associates GPUs with being the primary AI compute engine, and they strive to create a highly integrated end-to-end platform. Our approach doesn\u2019t involve manufacturing those GPUs; instead, we focus on facilitating their operation efficiently. Ultimately, we aim to complement GPUs for customers who are expanding their GPU clusters.",

And then as you think about the growth for the full year, how are those split in that realm as well? Are they kind of going hand-in-hand?

And we don't really quite understand it 100%. All we know, it used to be 80% accelerators, 20% networking.

You layer on top of that your GPU - TPU customers are accelerating their cadence of new product introductions and deployments of their products. So is this also driving faster adoption curve for your latest products? And then maybe just as importantly, like clockwork, it has been two years since you've introduced your product, right, which if I look back historically, means you have silicon and are getting ready to introduce your next-generation products, which would put you two to three years ahead of your competitors.

The journey is not over by any means, but it is pretty much very much to expectation. Moving to subscription, well, in VMware we are very slow compared to a lot of other guys, Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle, who have already been pretty much in subscription. So VMware is late in that process. But we're trying to make up for it by offering it in a very compelling manner because subscription is the right thing to do, right? It's a situation where you put out your product offering, and you update it, patch it, but update it feature-wise, everything as capabilities on a continual basis, almost like getting your news on an ongoing basis, subscription online versus getting it in a printed manner once a week. That's how I compare perpetual to subscription. So it is very interesting for a lot of people to get on board. And so to no surprise, they are getting on very well. The big selling point we have, as I indicated, is the fact that we are not just trying to keep customers kind of stuck on just server or compute virtualization. That's a great product, great technology, but it's been out for 20 years. Based on what we are offering now at a very compelling price point, the whole software stack to use vSphere and its basic fundamental technology to virtualize networking, storage, operation and management, the entire data center and create this self-service private cloud. And thanks for saying it, you're right, and we have priced it down to the point where it is comparable with just compute virtualization. So yes, that is getting a lot of interest, a lot of attention from the customers. We have signed up who would like to deploy private cloud, their own private cloud on-prem. As a nice complement, maybe even alternative or hybrid to public clouds, that's the selling point, and we are getting a lot of interest from our customers in doing that.",

You also talked about your operating margin in that business converging to classic Broadcom levels. I know the integration is not done and you're still kind of in debt paydown mode. But how should we think about your growth strategy beyond VMware?

We're able to show 12% organic growth year-on-year. So almost have to say, do we need to rush to buy another company? The answer is no. But all options are always open because we are trying to create the best value for our shareholders who have entrusted us with the capital to do that. So I would not discount that alternative because our strategy, our long-term model has always been to grow through a combination of acquisition, but also on the assets we acquire to really improve, invest, and operate them better to show organic growth as well. But again, organic growth often enough is determined very much by how fast your market would grow. So we do look towards acquisitions now and then.",

While we aren't fully engaged in that market, we do supply components like DSPs, lasers, and PIN diodes for high-bandwidth optical connections. When considering networking as a whole, including switching and all relevant components attached to clustering GPUs, approximately 25% of the GPU's value can be attributed to networking. However, not all of this is part of my available market, as I don\u2019t handle the optical connections directly, but I do supply some related components. A simple way to view it is that around 25% to 30% of all infrastructure components are linked to the value of GPUs. Nonetheless, it\u2019s important to note that deployment timing may vary; there could be early GPU purchases followed by later networking investments, which is why you're seeing a mix within my AI revenue.

And I know that you said historically, that's not really a direct customer to you. But could you talk about what differentiates you from the new entrant in the market as of late? And then there's been profitability questions around the sustainability of gross margins longer term. Can you talk about if you see any increased competition?

To put it into perspective, each of these AI accelerators functions similarly to a GPU. Running large language models requires multiple accelerators, regardless of their power. Additionally, these models demand significant memory access. Each accelerator comes with considerable cache memory, commonly known as high-bandwidth memory designed for AI accelerators or GPUs. We provide both components in our custom business. The compute function related to the chips has margins comparable to most semiconductor businesses, but when paired with a large amount of third-party memory, it doesn't contribute to margin stacking. Basic math indicates that this affects the margins for AI accelerators that include memory, which we do. While this arrangement increases revenue, it does dilute the margin. However, the R&D and operating expenses relative to this higher revenue are significantly lower. So, on an operating margin basis, this segment is just as profitable, if not more so, given the scalability of the custom AI accelerators. Their performance is even better than our typical operating margin. This return on investment is what drives us to excel in this challenging field. To answer your first question, there is only one Broadcom.",

And by the way, this is exactly why Hock, in his statements earlier on, mentioned that seven out of the top eight hyperscalers use our portfolio. And they use it specifically because it provides that flexibility. So whether you have an architecture that's based on an endpoint and you want to actually build your platform that way or you want that switching to happen in the fabric itself, that's why we have the full end-to-end portfolio. So that actually has been a proven differentiator for us. And then on top of that, we've been working, as you know, to provide a complete network operating system that's open on top of that using SONiC and Psi, which has been deployed in many of the hyperscalers. And so the combination of the portfolio plus the stack really differentiates the solution that we can offer to these hyperscalers.

What we're offering isn't something that companies want to do on their own since they're already investing in building their own on-prem data centers. Historically, many enterprises follow a best-of-breed approach, which means they create data centers with the best compute, often using vSphere for compute virtualization, alongside top networking and storage solutions, all managed by a common operations layer, which is frequently VMware. The challenge is that this mixed approach does not create a highly resilient data center. With a diverse setup, it's difficult to quickly identify root causes when issues arise, leading to blame being assigned in different directions. Many CIOs we speak to express a desire for a unified platform instead of the traditional best of breed. This creates opportunities, as those starting from scratch in a greenfield scenario can implement solutions more easily, while those in brownfield situations, trying to upgrade existing data centers, often face more challenges. I don't think we're witnessing a significant level of crowding out; there is competition in greenfield scenarios where budgets can be allocated to an entire platform instead of just best-of-breed options. However, upgrading existing data centers presents a more complex situation for us. Regarding our revenue mix, Brocade is performing very well this year, but we know that it won't last forever as Brocade, like many enterprise purchases, goes through cycles.

This strategy is showing promise six months in as we are seeing increased activity. The resellers tend to focus on the extensive long tail of VMware's customers. The largest enterprises among the top 10,000 customers, such as major banks and healthcare companies, demand tailored service and support from us. To meet this need, we've adopted a direct approach while still leveraging our chosen resellers where necessary. The resellers provide valuable services to the broader customer base. We've strengthened our reseller network to enable them to manage and support customers effectively, without directly competing with them unless the customer prefers that option. Customers can choose the level of support they want, whether through direct sales from VMware or through resellers, streamlining the process for them. In contrast to our previous approach where there was significant chaos in the channel, we now ensure clarity in our relationships. Customers can purchase directly from VMware or through resellers, and we also offer them the option of running their applications efficiently in a managed hosted environment through a network of global managed service providers.

          "content": "Thank you, Ji, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. In our fiscal Q3 2024, consolidated net revenue of $13.1 billion was up 47% year-on-year, and operating profit was up 44% year-on-year. These strong results reflected three key factors: one, AI revenue continues to grow and grow strongly; two, VMware bookings continue to accelerate; and three, non-AI semiconductor revenue has stabilized. Before I give you more color on our two reporting segments, let me give you a quick update on guidance. Now we started the year providing annual guidance with quarterly updates as we run the process of integrating VMware. Things are now much more stable and we're in the final quarter of 2024. So instead of giving you annual guidance, we now revert to providing the quarterly guidance for Q4. Starting with software. In Q3, infrastructure software segment revenue of $5.8 billion was up 200% year-on-year driven by $3.8 billion in revenue contribution from VMware. The transformation of the business model of VMware continues to progress very well. In fact, last week, we held a well-attended VMware Explore Conference in Las Vegas, our first as a combined company. This event was all about promoting VMware Cloud Foundation, or VCF, which is the full software stack that virtualizes an entire data center and creates a private cloud environment on-prem for enterprises. The success of this strategy is reflected in our performance in fiscal Q3. We booked more than 15 million CPU costs of VCF, representing over 80% of the total VMware products we booked during the quarter. And this translates into an annualized booking value, or ABV, as I had described before, of $2.5 billion during Q3, up 32% from the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, we continue to drive down costs in VMware. We brought VMware spending down to $1.3 million in Q3 from $1.6 million in Q2. And when we acquired VMware, our target was to deliver adjusted EBITDA of $8.5 billion within three years of the acquisition. We are well on the path to achieving or even exceeding this EBITDA goal in the next fiscal '25. Now turning to semiconductors. In networking, Q3 revenue of $4 billion grew 43% year-on-year, representing 55% of semiconductor revenue. This was again driven by strong demand from hyperscalers for both AI networking and on custom AI accelerators. As you know, our hyperscale customers continue to scale up and scale out their AI clusters. Custom AI accelerators grew 3.5 times year-on-year. In the fabric, Ethernet switching, driven by Tomahawk 5 and Jericho3-AI grew over 4 times year-on-year, while our optical lasers and PIN diodes used in optical interconnects grew three-fold. Meanwhile, PCI Express switches more than doubled, and we're shipping in volume our industry-leading 5 nanometer, 400 gigabit per second NICs and 800 gigabit per second DSPs. So now let me give you more color on our networking products, which are not used in AI. As we had indicated last quarter, we believe we did bottom in Q2. And in Q3, non-AI networking was up actually 17% sequentially, even as it was down 41% year-on-year. We expect this level of revenue to sustain in Q4 and the year-on-year decline to moderate to 30%. So in adding the strength, we continue to see in AI, we expect total networking revenue to grow over 40% year-on-year in Q4. Across enterprise infrastructure, we see the same trend of recovery in server storage. Our Q3 server storage connectivity revenue was $861 million, up 5% sequentially and down 25% year-on-year. In Q4, we expect server storage revenue to grow mid to high-single digit percent sequentially, even as revenue is expected to be down high-single digit percent year-on-year. Moving on to wireless. Q3 wireless revenue of $1.7 billion grew 1% year-on-year, representing 23% of semiconductor revenue. And in Q4, reflecting the launch of next-generation devices and our North American customers, we expect wireless revenue to actually grow over 20% sequentially even as it will be relatively flat year-on-year. On to broadband, Q3 revenue declined 49% year-on-year to $557 million, representing 8% of semiconductor revenue. Broadband remains weak on a continued pause in telco and service provider spending. And in Q4, we expect broadband to continue to be down over 40% year-on-year, but we do expect that recovery to begin in '25. Finally, Q3 industrial resales of $164 million declined 31% year-on-year. We believe we are approaching bottom in Q3 as Q4 resales are expected to recover sequentially. Year-on-year, Q4 industrial resales will still be down approximately 20%. In summary, here are the trends we are seeing in semiconductors. In aggregate, we have reached the bottom in our non-AI markets, and we're expecting a recovery in Q4. AI demand remains strong and we expect, in Q4, AI revenue to grow sequentially 10% to over $3.5 billion. This will translate to AI revenue of $12 billion for fiscal '24, up from our prior guidance of over $11 billion. Putting it all together with software, here's our forecast for Q4. We expect Q4 semiconductor revenue of approximately $8 billion, up 9% year-on-year. For infrastructure software, we expect revenue to be about $6 billion. So we are guiding Q4 consolidated revenue to be approximately $14 billion, which is up 51% year-on-year. We also expect this will drive Q4 consolidated adjusted EBITDA to approximate 64% of revenue. This Q4 guidance would imply we are raising the outlook for our fiscal 2024 revenue to $51.5 billion and adjusted EBITDA for the year to 61.5%. And with that, let me turn the call over to Kirsten.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q3 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $13.1 billion for the quarter, up 47% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q3 revenue increased 4% year-on-year. Gross margins were 77.4% of revenue in the quarter. R&D was $1.5 billion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2.2 billion, up year-on-year primarily due to the consolidation of VMware. Q3 operating income was $7.9 billion and was up 44% from a year ago, with an operating margin at 61% of revenue. Excluding transition costs, operating profit of $8 billion was up 45% from a year ago with an operating margin of 62% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $8.2 billion or 63% of revenue. This figure excludes $149 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our semiconductor solutions segment was $7.3 billion and represented 56% of total revenue in the quarter; this was up 5% year-on-year. Gross margins for our semiconductor solutions segment were approximately 68%, down 270 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of custom AI accelerators. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to $881 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, up 200% year-on-year, primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 44% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 90% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.3 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 67%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 69%. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $4.8 billion and represented 37% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $529 million, free cash flows of $5.3 billion were up 14% year-on-year and represented 41% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition and higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of U.S. income and the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174. We spent $172 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 32 days in the quarter, in line with the year ago. We ended the third quarter with inventory of $1.9 billion, up 3% sequentially. Note that we continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the third quarter with $10 billion of cash and $72.3 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate notes with new fixed senior notes. We used the proceeds from the completed sale of VMware's End-User Computing business to KKR, and cash on hand to reduce floating rate debt by an additional $4.2 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $53 billion in fixed rate debt is 3.6% and 7.7 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $19 billion in floating rate debt is 6.7% and 3.1 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $1.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes due in Q4. Turning to capital allocation. In Q3, we paid stockholders $2.5 billion of cash dividends, which based on a split adjusted quarterly common stock count, represented a cash dividend of $0.525 per share. For Q4, we are rounding up the quarterly cash dividend to $0.53 per share. In Q3, the split adjusted non-GAAP diluted share count was 4.92 billion, in line with expectations. We paid $1.4 billion of withholding taxes due on vesting of employee equity, resulting in the elimination of 8.4 million AVGO shares. In Q4, we expect the non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.91 billion shares. Now on to guidance. Our guidance for Q4 is for consolidated revenue of $14 billion and adjusted EBITDA of approximately 64%. For modeling purposes, we expect consolidated gross margins to be down approximately 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors. GAAP net income and cash flows in Q4 are impacted by higher taxes, restructuring, and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. As Hock just discussed, we are resuming quarterly revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2025 as fiscal year '24 has been a transition and integration year following the VMware deal close. That concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, please open up the call for questions.",

In semiconductors, the non-AI networking is down over 50% compared to its previous performance. Additionally, other areas are also significantly below their peaks. Is there a particular reason for this, or is it simply a cyclical issue? Will these areas return to their prior levels once recovery occurs? Moving on to the software side, the non-VMware components appear to have returned to approximately $2 billion per quarter, similar to previous figures. Is this decline primarily due to Brocade? Furthermore, is this $2 billion per quarter the bottom line, and should we consider this as the growth benchmark for the non-VMware software business moving forward?",

          "content": "On the semiconductor side, the situation is straightforward. As you know, we've experienced the typical downturn in the semiconductor market, particularly in the non-AI segment, which we've discussed multiple times. We've been through this downturn, and as our customers and the broader ecosystem adjust their inventory levels throughout the supply chain, we haven't been completely insulated from it. However, we believe we have passed the lowest point. The best indicator of recovery is the bookings we're seeing. In the third quarter, our non-AI semiconductor bookings are up 20%, indicating that we are on the path to recovery. The timing and level of recovery can vary by end market, but we have passed the lowest point in enterprise sectors, including enterprise data center and IT spending. The third quarter saw a sequential recovery from what we believe was the bottom in the second or first quarter of this fiscal year, and we expect this recovery to continue into the fourth quarter and into 2025. Although we haven't yet seen the same recovery in broadband, we believe it is nearing the bottom, with bookings improving from previous levels. Overall, we are confident that the non-AI semiconductor market has moved past its downturn and is on an upswing. Historically, we\u2019ve always bounced back to previous levels, and considering the current rate of bookings, there\u2019s no reason to think we won't do so again. Additionally, as AI technology integrates into enterprises and among digital natives, there will be an increased need for server, storage, and networking upgrades across the entire ecosystem. This could set the stage for an upcycle, though the timing is uncertain. I believe 2024 will mark the lowest point before an uptick. Regarding the software segment, we\u2019ve achieved a level of stability, particularly with our non-VMware revenue, which has stabilized despite the volatility of Brocade. We are focusing on how VMware will grow over the next year and a half.",

There\u2019s really no direct connection between those markets. Long term, the large hyperscalers, with their substantial consumer subscriber bases, are set to run extensive large language models and AI workloads. Over time, this will likely lead them to develop their own compute silicon and custom accelerators. We are currently witnessing this transition, which may take several years. My path is centered on enabling custom accelerators, not on helping enterprises with AI on their workloads, which is more aligned with the merchant companies. While some merchant firms are currently involved with hyperscalers, there\u2019s an ongoing transition where those areas do not connect directly.

Essentially, our intention with that transaction was to emphasize our long-term belief in the sustainability of hard disk drive media as a viable storage alternative for hyperscalers. It\u2019s logical to consider that while everything may eventually transition to flash, hard disk drive storage will still maintain its significance. The technology surrounding this is particularly fascinating to us and has great potential for development. Currently, hard disks range from 22 to 24 terabytes, and we're looking ahead to advancements that could bring us to 30, 40, and even 50 terabytes. A lot of innovation will take place along that journey, with much of it relying on silicon. Therefore, our initiative is more of a collaborative effort, albeit structured as a purchase of intellectual property. We\u2019re integrating our engineers and designers with theirs, effectively supporting Seagate and ultimately the entire industry in pursuing a roadmap aimed at achieving 50 terabytes. This is our goal and vision, and we aim to realize this within five years or less. We firmly believe that hard disk drive storage will remain robust over the next five years, if not longer.",

It also looks like they're trying to accelerate their deployments of their GPUs, XPUs, and networking into their data centers here in the second half of the year. We know that on AI accelerators specifically, supply is quite tight, given the colos packaging and the HBM memory constraints. So has the team seen upside orders and demand for XPUs and networking here in the second half? Have you been able to meet that upside demand or is the team somewhat supply constrained?

You've said in the past calls that you thought that AI compute would move away from ASICs and go to merchant market. But it looks like the trend is kind of heading the other way. Are you still of the opinion that that's going to be the long-term trend of this? And secondly, as you just pointed out, power is becoming the defining factor for deployment with all the big guys at this point. Given the performance per watt of the ASICs over GPUs, which is superior to GPUs, why shouldn't we see more of these guys moving to custom ASIC? I know it takes a long time and it takes a lot of funding, etc. But especially as the enterprise starts getting more involved with this, there are going to be some applications that are kind of standard across some of the enterprises wouldn't even see some of the bigger, like AWS, move to custom silicon for a specific workload.

You're right to point out that I used to believe general-purpose merchant silicon would ultimately prevail. Historically, general-purpose small merchant silicon has often been successful. However, I have changed my perspective on this, a shift I made around last quarter or maybe six months ago. It\u2019s positive to keep up with these developments. I think there are two distinct markets for AI accelerators. First, we have the enterprises, which generally lack the capability, financial resources, or interest to develop their own custom silicon, large language models, or the necessary software to run AI workloads on custom silicon. The costs are too high and the returns too low for them. On the other hand, there are a few hyperscalers in the cloud space that have the scale and financial power to rationalize the creation of their own custom accelerators. Ultimately, it all centers around compute engines, especially for training large language models on their platforms. The emphasis is largely about GPUs\u2014now seriously, GPUs have become more critical than the engineers to these hyperscalers in their planning. Those GPUs, or XPUs, are very significant. Thus, it makes sense for them to take control of their future by developing their own custom silicon accelerators, which is what I'm observing; they are all doing this, albeit at different speeds and starting points. It takes time, but these few hyperscalers are already creating their own systems to train on large language models. They are definitely moving in the direction of ASICs or XPUs, custom silicon. At the same time, there remains a market for merchant silicon in the enterprise space.",

          "content": "Thank you, Ji. And thank you everyone for joining us today. Well, this has been a transformative year for Broadcom. Our fiscal year 2024 consolidated revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion. Now, excluding VMware, our revenue grew over 9% organically. So fiscal 2024 operating profit, excluding transition costs grew 42% year-over-year. And we returned a record $22 billion in cash to our shareholders, up 45% year-on-year through dividends, buyback and eliminations. There were two significant drivers of this transformation this year. First, we closed the acquisition of VMware in the early weeks of fiscal 2024 and have focused VMware on its technology leadership in data center virtualization. The integration of VMware is largely complete. Revenue is on a growth trajectory and operating margin reached 70% exiting 2024. We are well on the path to delivering incremental adjusted EBITDA at a level that significantly exceeds the $8.5 billion we communicated when we announced the deal. We are planning to achieve this much earlier than our initial target of three years. The second driver in 2024 was AI. Our AI revenue, which came from strength in custom AI accelerators or XPUs and networking, grew 220% from $3.8 billion in fiscal 2023 to $12.2 billion in fiscal 2024 and represented 41% of our semiconductor revenue. This drove semiconductor revenue up to a record $30.1 billion during the year. Okay, now let's move on to the fourth quarter and give you more color. Consolidated net revenue of $14.1 billion was up 51% year-on-year, excluding VMware. Organic growth was 11%, and operating profit of $8.8 billion was up 53% year-on-year. For the details on infrastructure software in Q4, this infrastructure software segment revenue was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year, flat sequentially, even as multiple deals slip over into Q1. In VMware, we booked $21 million total CPU costs in a quarter versus $19 million a quarter ago. Of these, about 70% represented VMware Cloud Foundation or VCF, the full software stack virtualizing the entire data center. And this translated into Annualized Booking Value, or ABV as we call it, of $2.7 billion for VMware in Q4 up from 2.5 billion in Q3. Since closing the acquisition just over a year ago, we've signed up over 4,500 of our largest 10,000 customers for VCF. VCF enabled customers to deploy private cloud environments on-prem, as an alternative to running their applications in the public cloud. And in doing all this, we continued to drive down spending in VMware. We brought spending down to $1.2 billion in Q4, down from $1.3 billion in Q3. By reference, VMware spending was averaging over $2.4 billion per quarter prior to the acquisition with operating margin less than 30%. Moving on to Q1 outlook for infrastructure software, we expect Q1 revenue to grow to $6.5 billion, up 11% sequentially and 41% up year-on-year. For VMware, ABV is expected to exceed $3 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the preceding quarter. Turning to semiconductors, let me give you more details by end markets. Networking Q4 revenue of $4.5 billion grew 45% year-on-year. AI networking revenue, which represented 76% of networking, grew 158% year-on-year. This was driven by a doubling of our AI XPU shipments to our three hyperscale customers and four times growth in AI connectivity revenue driven by our Tomahawk and Jericho shipments globally. In Q1, we expect the momentum in AI connectivity to be as strong as more hyperscalers deploy Jericho3-AI in their fabrics. Our next generation XPUs are in 3 nanometers and will be the first of its kind to market in that process node. We are on track for volume shipment at our hyperscale customers in the second half of fiscal 2025. Turning on to server storage. From its bottom six months ago, Q4 server storage connectivity revenue has recovered some 20% to $992 million. And in Q4, we expect server storage revenue to continue to grow. Turning to wireless, as we expected, seasonal launches by our North American customer drove Q4 wireless revenue to $2.2 billion, up 30% sequentially. This was up 7% year-on-year because of higher content. We continue to be very engaged with this customer in multi-year roadmaps across various technologies we have leadership in, including RF, WiFi, Bluetooth, sensing, and touch. In Q1, reflecting seasonality, we expect wireless to be down sequentially, but still be flat year-on-year. In Q4, Broadband reached bottom at $465 million, down 51% year-on-year. We have seen significant orders across multiple service providers during this quarter. And reflecting this trend, we now expect broadband to show recovery beginning in Q1. Finally, on to industrial, which only represents 1% of the total revenues. Measured on resales, Q4 industrial resales of $173 million declined 27% year-on-year. We only expect a recovery in the second half of 2025. Before I sum up and provide you Q1 fiscal 2025 guidance, let me outline a longer-term perspective on how we see our semiconductor business evolving over the next three years. On the broad portfolio of non-AI semiconductors with its multiple end markets, we saw a cyclical bottom in fiscal 2024 at $17.8 billion. We expect a recovery from this level at the industry's historical growth rate of mid-single digits. In sharp contrast, we see our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive. Specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators or XPUs, as well as network these XPUs with open and scalable Ethernet connectivity. For each of them, this represents a multi-year, not a quarter-to-quarter journey. As you know, we currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind, though, this will not be a linear ramp. We'll show quarterly variability. To compound this, we have been selected by two additional hyperscalers and are in advanced development for their own next-generation AI XPUs. We have line of sight to develop these prospects into revenue-generating customers before 2027 and could therefore expand the SAM significantly. So the reality going forward for this company is that the AI semiconductor business will rapidly outgrow the non-AI semiconductor business. Recognizing this, we will now shift to guiding our semiconductor business by AI and non-AI revenue segments. So summarizing Q4. Semiconductor revenue of $8.2 billion grew 12% year-on-year and 13% sequentially. Q4 AI revenue grew a strong 150% year-on-year to $3.7 billion. Non-AI semiconductor revenue declined by 23% year-on-year to $4.5 billion, but still a 10% recovery from the bottom of six months ago. Now moving on to our outlook for Q1. We expect semiconductor revenue to grow approximately 10% year-on-year to $8.1 billion. AI demand remained strong and we expect AI revenue to grow 65% year-on-year to $3.8 billion. We expect non-AI semiconductor revenue to be down about mid-teens percent year-on-year. And so in total, summing this all up, we're guiding consolidated Q1 revenue to be approximately $14.6 billion, up 22% year-on-year, and we expect this will drive Q1 adjusted EBITDA to approximately 66% of revenue.",

          "content": "Thank you, Hock. Let me now provide additional detail on our Q4 financial performance. Consolidated revenue was $14.1 billion for the quarter, up 51% from a year ago. Excluding the contribution from VMware, Q4 revenue increased 11% year-on-year. Gross margins were 76.9% of revenue in the quarter, up 260 basis points from the year-ago quarter. R&D was $1.4 billion, and consolidated operating expenses were $2 billion, up year-on-year primarily due to the acquisition and consolidation of VMware. Q4 operating income was $8.8 billion and was up 53% from a year ago, with operating margin at 63% of revenue. Adjusted EBITDA was $9.1 billion or 65% of revenue. This figure excludes $156 million of depreciation. Now a review of the P&L for our two segments, starting with semiconductors. Revenue for our Semiconductor Solutions segment was $8.2 billion and represented 59% of total revenue in the quarter. This was up 12% year-on-year. Gross margins for our Semiconductor Solutions segment were approximately 67%, down 220 basis points year-on-year, driven primarily by a higher mix of AI XPUs. Operating expenses increased 11% year-on-year to $914 million on increased investment in R&D, resulting in semiconductor operating margins of 56%. Now moving on to infrastructure software. Revenue for infrastructure software was $5.8 billion, up 196% year-on-year primarily due to the contribution of VMware and represented 41% of revenue. Gross margins for infrastructure software were 91% in the quarter, and operating expenses were $1.1 billion in the quarter, resulting in infrastructure software operating margin of 72%. Excluding transition costs, operating margin was 73%. Moving on to cash flow. Free cash flow in the quarter was $5.5 billion and represented 39% of revenues. Excluding cash used for restructuring and integration of $506 million, free cash flows of $6 billion were up 22% year-on-year and represented 43% of revenue. Free cash flow as a percentage of revenue has declined from the same quarter a year ago, due to higher cash interest expense from debt related to the VMware acquisition, higher cash taxes due to a higher mix of U.S. taxable income, the continued delay in the reenactment of Section 174, and recent proposed regulations on corporate AMT. We spent $122 million on capital expenditures. Days sales outstanding were 29 days in the fourth quarter compared to 31 days a year ago. We ended the fourth quarter with inventory of $1.8 billion, down 7% sequentially. We continue to remain disciplined on how we manage inventory across the ecosystem. We ended the fourth quarter with $9.3 billion of cash and $69.8 billion of gross principal debt. During the quarter, we replaced $5 billion of floating rate debt with new senior notes. We use cash on hand to pay a mix of senior notes, which came due in Q4 and additional floating rate debt, reducing debt by $2.5 billion. Following these actions, the weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $56 billion in fixed-rate debt is 3.7% and 7.6 years, respectively. The weighted average coupon rate and years to maturity of our $14 billion in floating rate debt is 5.9% and 3.2 years, respectively. We expect to repay approximately $495 million of fixed-rate senior notes coming due in Q1. Now let me recap our financial performance for fiscal year 2024. Our revenue hit a record $51.6 billion, growing 44% year-on-year, including VMware, and 9% organically, excluding VMware. Semiconductor revenue was $30.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Infrastructure software revenue was $21.5 billion, up 181% year-on-year and up 90% year-on-year, excluding VMware. Fiscal 2024 adjusted EBITDA was $31.9 billion and represented 62% of revenue. Free cash flow grew 10% year-on-year to $19.4 billion and up 22% year-on-year to $21.9 billion, excluding restructuring and integration costs.",

          "content": "Turning to capital allocation. For fiscal 2024, we spent $22.2 billion, consisting of $9.8 billion in the form of cash dividends and $12.4 billion in share repurchases and eliminations. Aligned with our ability to generate increased cash flows in the preceding year and off of a larger share count base from the acquisition of VMware, we are announcing an increase in our quarterly common stock cash dividend in Q1 fiscal 2025 to $0.59 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 11% from the prior quarter. We intend to maintain this target quarterly dividend throughout fiscal '25, subject to quarterly board approval. This implies that our fiscal 2025 annual common stock dividend is set to be a record $2.36 per share on a split-adjusted basis, an increase of 12% year-on-year. I would like to highlight that this represents the 14th consecutive increase in annual dividends since we initiated dividends in fiscal 2011. Now moving on to guidance. From a year-on-year comparable basis, keep in mind that Q1 of fiscal '24 was a 14-week quarter and Q1 of fiscal '25 is a 13-week quarter. As we are now past one year following the close of the VMware acquisition starting in Q1 of fiscal 2025, we will no longer break out VMware revenue and costs on a stand-alone basis. We will continue to report infrastructure software segment revenue and profitability which includes Brocade Fibre Channel SAN, CA Mainframe Enterprise Security, and VMware. Our guidance for Q1 is for consolidated revenue of $14.6 billion, with semiconductor revenue of $8.1 billion, up approximately 10% year-on-year and infrastructure software revenue of $6.5 billion, up 41% year-on-year. We expect Q1 adjusted EBITDA to be a record 66% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted share count to be approximately 4.9 billion shares. For modeling purposes, we expect Q1 consolidated gross margins to be up 100 basis points sequentially on the higher revenue mix of infrastructure software and product mix within semiconductors. Note that consolidated gross margins through the year will be impacted by the revenue mix of infrastructure software and semiconductors and product mix within semiconductors. We expect the non-GAAP tax rate in fiscal year 2025 to be approximately 14.5% as tax deductions related to interest expense are reduced, as we pay down and refinance debt under more favorable interest terms. GAAP net income and cash flows in Q1 will be impacted by higher taxes, restructuring and integration-related cash costs due to the VMware acquisition. That concludes my prepared remarks.

The sovereign players are similar to the enterprise market, which primarily consists of merchant solutions. These sovereign entities typically lack the ability to develop not only the hardware but more crucially, the software framework necessary to enable transistors in hardware to interface with high-level languages, which are essential for the operation of large language models and AI applications. This will be accomplished primarily through XPUs. Regarding your first question about the ratio of AI connectivity and networking to XPUs versus compute, this is a dynamic figure due to changes in cluster costs. However, certain ratios are worth noting. A key aspect to consider is the distinction between scaling up and scaling out. As we grow into a larger single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPUs, the importance of scaling up becomes increasingly significant. The ratio we discuss as we scale up tends to increase almost exponentially. Currently, networking accounts for approximately 5% to 10% of AI content in silicon, but this is projected to rise to 15% to 20% as we approach clusters of 500,000 to 1 million XPUs or GPUs.",

The progression of this journey with each of our customers will vary based on their adoption rates and their own XPUs, which will play a significant role in this. We expect some quarter-to-quarter variability due to having only three customers and the fact that deployments typically happen in large increments. So, my best response is that I can't provide any more clarity beyond what I've already shared.",
